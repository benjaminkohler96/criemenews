       "   'summary': \"Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascon said Thursday his office had received new evidence in the infamous Menendez brothers murder case that may eventually lead to their release from prison.\\nGascon said at a press conference the convictions of Erik and Lyle Menendez for killing their parents in August 1989 should be reevaluated in the wake of new evidence allegedly being discovered, and whether testimony in their second trial that would have backed up some of their abuse claims should have been allowed.\\nGascon said it was not in dispute that the brothers, who were 18 and 21 at the time, killed their parents, but new evidence could change the public perception of the case.\\nRobert Rand, a journalist researching the case for a documentary, allegedly found a letter written by Erik that detailed the sexual abuse months before the parents' slaying.\\nRoy Rosello, a former member of the boy band Menudo, has also recently come forward to say he was assaulted by Jose Menendez when the latter was an executive at RCA Records.\\nThe brothers were convicted of fatally shooting their parents Jose and Kitty Menendez in their Beverly Hills home in 1989.\\nDuring their trial, prosecutors argued the brothers wanted to speed up receiving their inheritance. Erik and Lyle Menendez, however, have long maintained they were long-time victims of sexual abuse by their father. Those claims, and other evidence, were not allowed in their second trial — the first ended with a deadlocked jury — and they were convicted and sentenced to life in prison.\\nThe letter found by Rand and Rosello's allegation led Mark Geragos, the brothers' lawyer, to file a petition with the district attorney's office to review the case.\\nOn Thursday, Gascon said that review was ongoing and a hearing was scheduled for Nov. 29 to determine the next steps in the process, which could lead to the brothers being resentenced, retried or released outright. They are currently in prison in San Diego.\\nThe case, which was one of the most high-profile of the 1990s, has seen renewed interest following the release of 'Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story' on Netflix.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"A contractor hired to replace lead pipes throughout Newark faked the work, put residents' lives at risk and charged the city $10 million for the job, federal investigators said Thursday.\\nJAS Group Enterprise was one of several contractors hired by Newark to replace lead pipes throughout the city. The program was hailed by many as a positive example of how quickly and effectively the dangerous pipes can be removed from a heavily populated city.\\nBut in cases where JAS Group was charged with replacing the pipes, the company simply didn't do it, the Justice Department said in a criminal complaint.\\nInstead, employees used misleading photos to claim they'd done the work, then billed the city as if it was complete, according to the feds.\\n'The subjects in this investigation knew they were not replacing the lead pipes, and then passed off misleading photos to conceal the ones they left in the ground,' Newark FBI agent Nelson I. Delgado said in a press release.\\nAdditionally, when the company found copper pipes in the ground, it cleaned them up and claimed to have completed the replacement work, the feds said.\\nEarlier this year, authorities in Newark revealed that some of the supposedly replaced lead pipes were still in the ground, and workers went around the city replacing them. However, local leaders would not say exactly what was happening.\\nNewark Mayor Ras Baraka said Thursday that the information was kept private because of the ongoing federal investigation. He claimed JAS Group only affected 1% of the entire project.\\nJAS CEO Michael Sawyer, 57, and company foreperson Latronia Sanders, 55, were charged Thursday with conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Sawyer and Sanders ordered their employees to fake the work, according to the feds. The other employees involved were not named.\\nLead contamination in Newark's drinking water was first discovered in 2016. By 2021, the lead pipe replacement program was completed — aside from JAS Group's alleged fraud — after the city took several steps to streamline the process.\",\n",

       "   'excerpt': \"Through two games against the Milwaukee Brewers this week, a lot has gone right and a little has gone wrong for the Mets. Here's what to watch for in Game 3.\",\n",
       "   'summary': \"MILWAUKEE — Two years ago, the Mets were in a similar spot, facing elimination in an NL Wild Card series. But that Mets team wasn't quite as resilient as the current one. That was a team that didn't know what it was like to lose and didn't face much adversity until the end of the season, when the Atlanta Braves caught them by surprise and took the wind out of their sails.\\nThis team has shown mental toughness and a gritty ability to surprise when counted out.\\n'Anything can happen at any given moment,' said first baseman Pete Alonso. 'The biggest thing is just stay locked in pitch-to-pitch. We can't really look at the big picture until the last out happens. Honestly, it's just win every pitch.'\\nThrough two games against the Milwaukee Brewers this week, a lot has gone right and a little has gone wrong. Here's what to watch for in Game 3.\\nCONTROLLING THE RUNNING GAME\\nThe Mets don't particularly excel at one aspect of the game, but they don't have any glaring weaknesses either. You could say their biggest weakness has been an inability to control the running game, but they've managed to curtail a speedy Milwaukee squad through the first two games of the series so far.\\nThe Brewers ran all over the Mets last weekend, swiping nine bags. But so far, they're 0-for-1 in the series.\\n'It starts on the mound, so that way we can give the catchers a chance to throw guys out,' said manager Carlos Mendoza. 'We did that today… We also did a good job of mixing up looks, holding the baseball and being quicker to the plate because that's what they do. We've got to continue to do that.'\\nLeft-hander Jose Quintana has thrown out two runners this season and allowed nine stolen bases. He's typically effective when it comes to changing tempos and checking runners when needed.\\nFINDING WAYS\\nWhen the Mets are at their best, the lineup is long. They don't chase pitches out of the zone and they work counts, wearing down opposing pitchers. This is how they won Game 1, but they chased in Game 2. They weren't able to get much offense going in a 5-3 loss. They don't like to wait for the big hit, but they sure could have used one Wednesday.\\n'They just hit two homers in the bottom of the eighth there, but I feel like the whole game, I thought we had great at bats,' Alonso said. 'So if we can continue to take care of the ball on defense, pitch well and have good at bats, I think we'll be alright.'\\nAlonso was once their biggest threat to homer, but he hit just 34 this season, the fewest in a full season since he entered the league in 2019. He also hit just .232 with runners in scoring position, a career-low.\\nBut the Mets don't typically rely on one hitter to get the job done and they aren't about to start now. The pressure isn't solely on Alonso, it's on every hitter to find ways to get on base and drive runners in against a team whose strength is their bullpen.\\nThe Brewers had the best bullpen in the NL during the regular season and manager Pat Murphy has used that to his advantage in the postseason. He had a quick hook with ace Freddy Peralta in Game 1 and with Frankie Montas in Game 2. The right-hander went only 3 2/3 innings Wednesday.\\n'When you're facing an elite pitching staff, it's not going to be easy to hit balls out of the ballpark,' Mendoza said. 'We've done a good job of going the other way, taking what the game is giving us [and] putting the ball in play. Tonight, we didn't do that.'\\nIt's worth noting that Game 3 could be Alonso's last with the Mets, as the slugger is set to hit free agency after the conclusion of the World Series.\\nBULLPEN USAGE\\nEdwin Diaz has yet to pitch in the series. Setup man Phil Maton has pitched three times in four days. The bullpen isn't necessarily in bad shape, but the Mets could consider using left-handed starter David Peterson if they're in a bind.\\nDiaz played catch Wednesday and wanted to pitch, but they left Maton in after giving up a leadoff homer to Jackson Chourio. After a single and a double play, he gave up the go-ahead shot to Garrett Mitchell.\\n'I'll be ready tomorrow,' Diaz said after Wednesday's loss. 'Whatever they need me for, I'll be on, even if it's early in the game. We've just got to win.'\\nTHE KIDS\\nJackson Chourio hit two home runs in Game 2 and Brice Turang went 2-for-3 with a double. Turang went 9-for-19 against the Mets during the regular season and 4-for-8 with a double and three stolen bases in two games over the weekend. In nine career games against the Mets, the 24-year-old second baseman has hit .375 with three doubles, a home run, five RBI, eight stolen bases and two walks with a .974 OPS.\\nThe Mets have to contain the kids.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"A South Carolina couple, married for more than 50 years and killed in the deadly chaos brought by Hurricane Helene, was discovered in their bed, their arms wrapped around each other in one final embrace.\\nMarcia and Jerry Savage had already turned in for the night when a large tree fell onto their home in Beech Island over the weekend, according to their grandson, John Savage. He said he'd just checked in on them, and then minutes later heard a horrifying crashing sound that again sent him to his grandparents' bedroom.\\n'All you could see was ceiling and tree,' he said. 'I was just going through sheer panic at that point.'\\nWhen he finally managed to clear away the debris, Savage said he found his grandparents still hugging each other. He believes his grandfather heard the tree snap before it fell and and 'rolled over to try and protect my grandmother.'\\nMarcie and Jerry Savage, who were 74 and 78 years old, respectively, are among more than 180 people who died during Helene's destructive tear across the south.\\nThe monstrous storm system, one of the deadliest in U.S. history, made landfall in Florida late the night of Sept. 26 as a powerful Category 4 hurricane, bringing with it 140 mph winds, torrential rain and sweeping power outages. While it quickly weakened on its journey inland, Helene remained treacherous and continued to unleash devastation for days across several other states, including Georgia and the Carolinas.\\nMarcia Savage was a retired bank teller and was active in her church while her husband, who was also retired, often took on handy work and odd jobs in the community. He previously worked as an electrician and carpenter, his daughter, Tammy Estep said. She remembered him as a 'doer' and the hardest worker that she knew.\\nThe couple, who were high school sweethearts, had been married for more than five decades and had four grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren. Their family believes God intended to take them together so one would never have to suffer without the other. Estep described their love as 'everlasting.'\\n'They loved each other to their dying day,' John Savage said.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"MILWAUKEE — The Mets ' comeback magic lasted another 7 1/2 innings before the Milwaukee Brewers got the big hit they needed to stay alive in the NL Wild Card series.\\nWith the Mets holding on to a 3-2 lead, right-hander Phil Maton gave up a game-tying home run to rookie sensation Jackson Chourio in the bottom of the eighth, his second of the game, and a huge, two-run go-ahead shot to Garrett Mitchell. The Mets dropped the second game of the series, 5-3, on Wednesday night at American Family Field.\\nNeither team gave up much offense. When the Mets had chances, the Brewers mostly made tough pitches, but they also failed to capitalize on the chances they did have, going 2-for-11 with runners in scoring position and leaving nine on base.\\nAfter huge comebacks Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, the Mets couldn't manage another.\\nDevin Williams, one of the NL's top closers, retired the side in order to convert the save and force a decisive Game 3 on Thursday.\\nThe winner will move on to face the Philadelphia Phillies in the NLDS.\\nThe Mets scrapped for three runs over the first two innings against right-hander Frankie Montas, and the Brewers got the home run from Chourio in the bottom of the first, and utilized Brice Turang's legs to get the second run across in the bottom of the fifth.\\nTurang, who went 9-for-19 against the Mets during the regular season and 4-for-8 with a double and three stolen bases in two games over the weekend, ripped one down the left field line to lead off. Left fielder Brandon Nimmo tried to play the ball off the bounce when it caromed off the wall, but it rolled past him. It was ruled a double, his third of the series. He moved to third on a grounder by Chourio.\\nThat was around the time the Mets got Reed Garrett up in the bullpen. Blake Perkins hit a fly ball to former Milwaukee outfielder Tyrone Taylor in center field to score Turang. Francisco Lindor helped Sean Manaea get out of it by making a tough play on a screaming grounder.\\nThat was it for the pitcher that helped carry the Mets' pitching staff all summer. Manaea left after two earned runs on six hits over five innings. He struck out four and didn't allow a walk.\\nThe entire game was too close for comfort. The Mets have been playing this way for weeks, with every pitch and every play carrying weight. And there were times when it was obvious that the Mets weren't exceptionally comfortable.\\nWith two on and none out in the top of the six and the Mets holding a one-run lead, Taylor and Francisco Alvarez both swung at first-pitch sliders low in the zone from Joel Payamps. Both hit right into outs. After the Brewers intentionally walked Lindor, Jose Iglesias, one of the Mets' best hitters with runners in scoring position, struck out on four pitches to strand the bases loaded.\\nLindor, still playing on an injured back, made some dynamic plays at shortstop, including a spinning throw to get Sal Frelick out in the bottom of the second, and a sliding stop on a 110.1 MPH grounder from William Contreras, the play that ended the fifth. But there were a few other plays where it was evident he was dealing with discomfort: diving stops where he was slow to get up and a groundball that got through the middle after he was only about a half-step away from grabbing.\\nStill, the Mets held a lead until Chourio's second homer of the game.\\nMontas went just 3 2/3 innings, allowing three runs (one earned), walking one and striking out three.\\nOriginally Published: October 2, 2024 at 10:40 p.m.\",\n",

The unique perspective he has on mortality informs the way he dates, with Tim telling Alex he doesn't 'want to get married, I want to die married.'\\nAshley and Tyler: ENGAGED\\nNuclear security officer Tyler, 33, was immediately smitten, telling a friend after date one that 31-year-old marketing director Ashley was 'maybe a 12' out of 10. Tyler told the guys she's the first woman he's ever regarded as 'safe.' And he wants to make her feel the same, even being open to sharing phone passwords.\\n'I want you to go through it and be more secure, if you want to,' he said. 'If I'm telling you I want to marry you, I'm respecting you on every level.'\\nBrittany and Leo: SPLIT\\nIt wouldn't be 'Love is Blind' without a love triangle, and one this season involves art dealer Leo, 30, and 32-year-old self-proclaimed obvious 'trophy wife' Brittany, an esthetician who hosts beach clean-ups.\\nUnlike plenty of 'Love is Blind' personalities, Leo said he's 'not trying to build an influencer career, I'm a rich f–king art dealer,' a role he inherited after the deaths of his parents and grandparents. Barely halfway through the first episode, Leo already found himself torn between Brittany and Hannah, 26, though he feared the former was more invested in his fortune.\\n'If I wanted to marry for the money, I would've married a very long time ago,' said Brittany, who told the viewer she's 'single because I chase fun' and is trying to break away from dating athletes and rock stars.\\nHannah and Nick: ENGAGED\\nThe youngest man and woman in the pods, these two are a match made in… hope. A former college football player, 28-year-old Nick was promptly flagged by most of the women as a potential playboy. But it was Hannah who caught his ears, and was just as taken in by his 'sultry' vibe.\\nJoking that they could be each other's Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce, the medical saleswoman acknowledged to her pals that Nick will 'probably ruin my life' and is a bit too smooth. Nick told his friends Hannah might be the first girl he's loved and the only person he wants to be with.\\nMarissa and Ramses: ENGAGED\\nOpposites attract for 31-year-old Marissa, a lawyer with a military background, and progressive Ramses, 34, who works at a justice reform nonprofit — but not before Marissa had to end things with her connection Bohdan. All it took was a bit of astrology to sway her.\\nMonica and Stephen: ENGAGED\\nStephen, a 34-year-old electrician, and Monica, a 36-year-old sales executive, hadn't even finished their first date when he copped to having technically cheated. But while that may have been a red flag for some (read: many), Monica appreciated the remorse Stephen showed, and decided they might just have a future — at least for another date.\\nTaylor and Garrett: ENGAGED\\nThe first hopefuls to get engaged, Taylor, a 29-year-old clean energy policy advocate and her quantum physicist Garrett, 31, immediately bonded over their vastly different experiences with physics as well as science tattoos — a hydrogen symbol for her and a quantum equation for him. It wasn't long (not even a full episode) before Garrett was boasting 'insane' feelings for Taylor and both were alluding to the future they'd envisioned.\",\n",

Nancy Pelosi said on CNN.\\nWalz, who registered what many analysts felt was an otherwise uneven debate performance, name checked several women impacted by Republican abortion bans, including Amber Thurman, a Georgia mom who died in 2022 after doctors delayed treating her for complications from a medication abortion.\\nA CBS News poll confirmed that debate viewers considered abortion to be Vance's worst issue, with Walz polling 62% with viewers on the question of which candidate handled the topic best.\\nAs the debate unfolded, Trump tweeted an all-caps statement promising he would veto a national abortion ban. He previously dodged questions about a potential veto at his own debate with Democrat Kamala Harris.\\nTrump also recently flip-flopped on Florida's abortion rights amendment, saying he would vote to uphold the state's draconian six-week ban on the practice.\\n''The GOP ticket's views on abortion are at best malleable and at worst extreme,' said Basil Smikle, a Columbia professor and Democratic strategist.\\nBrian Derrick, a Democratic strategist and founder of fundraising platform Oath.vote, said Vance's response shows the GOP is struggling to contain the damage from the abortion issue.\\n'Vance said the quiet part out loud: Republicans' extremist policies on abortion are out of step with everyday Americans' views,' Derrick said. 'Republicans are scrambling because they know they are going to pay a price for playing games with women's lives.\",\n",

'The reality is that Sheena and I have been together for quite some time. We've been planning our marriage for a while.'\\n'Both of our parents are really getting older and having some health issues, and we made the right decision to do it when we did. And any suggestion otherwise to me is just ridiculous on his face,' the chancellor said, one day after a New York Post reporter confronted the newlyweds outside their Harlem townhouse about the privilege, which protects communications between married couples and prevents spouses from testifying against one another in court.\\nWhile their union gives them the right to decline to testify against each other, legal experts said, it does not extend to their communications from before their weekend wedding on Martha's Vineyard, and there is no evidence the couple, who got engaged in fall 2022, tied the knot for legal protection.\\nThe nuptials, Banks said, were limited to immediate family and 'just a couple of friends.' Photos shared with FOX 5 showed the pair — Wright in a lace mid-length dress, Banks in a linen suit — wed in a casual ceremony at a lush garden without an altar.\\nWith investigations swirling City Hall and Adams back in court Wednesday on federal bribery and campaign finance charges, Banks said he remains focused and school continues to open 'every day.' Sources told the Daily News investigators are looking into the chancellor's consultant brother Terence Banks' business interests before the city — including with the agencies of David and Phil Banks, the deputy mayor of public safety.\\n'I think parents all across New York City would tell you, in no way do they see any level of distraction,' Banks said. 'They see a level of stability and focus, and we continue to move the work forward.'\\nWhile the newlyweds were back in the city this week, Banks said he was hopeful for a honeymoon after his retirement, effective Dec. 31.\",\n",

I can tell you today that this investigation is not over,' Alma Police Chief Jeff Pointer said Tuesday at a press conference. 'It is ongoing and active.'\\nLincks was considered as a suspect in the initial investigation into Morgan's disappearance. About two months after Morgan was kidnapped, Lincks was caught trying to snatch an 11-year-old girl just eight miles from the baseball field where Morgan was last seen, according to local CBS affiliate KFSM.\\nAt the time, he was spotted driving a red truck, which was also the suspect vehicle in Morgan's abduction. However, he denied any involvement in that case.\\nLincks was serving prison time for the attempted abduction when he died in 2000. More than two decades later, in 2021, the FBI identified Lincks as a person of interest in Morgan's disappearance.\\nInvestigators tracked down the truck that Lincks used to own and found a hair that, through DNA analysis, they learned belonged to a member of the Nick family. All other family members said they had never seen the truck before.\\nMorgan's body has never been found.

       "   'summary': \"BEIRUT (AP) — Israel's ground incursion into Lebanon to battle Hezbollah militants left eight Israeli soldiers dead Wednesday, while the region braced for further escalation as Israel vowed to retaliate for Iran's ballistic missile attack a day earlier.\\nThe Israeli military said seven soldiers were killed in two separate attacks, without elaborating. Those deaths followed an earlier announcement of the first Israeli combat death in Lebanon since the start of the incursion — a 22-year-old captain in a commando brigade. Another seven troops, including a combat medic, were wounded.\\nTogether, the assaults were some of the deadliest against Israeli forces in months. The announcements came on the eve of Rosh Hashana, the Jewish new year.\\n1 of 8\\nIsraelis take cover as projectiles launched from Iran are being intercepted in the skies over in Rosh HaAyin, Israel, Tuesday, Oct. 1, 2024. (AP Photo/Maya Alleruzzo)\\nIn Gaza, where the nearly yearlong war that triggered the widening conflict rages with no end in sight, Israeli ground and air operations in a hard-hit city killed at least 51 people, including women and children, Palestinian medical officials said.\\nIsrael has continued to strike what it says are combatant targets across Gaza nearly a year after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack ignited the war. Hamas has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United States, Canada and the European Union.\\nThe escalation on multiple fronts has raised fears of a wider war in the Middle East that could further draw in Iran — which backs Hezbollah and Hamas — as well as the United States, which has rushed military assets to the region in support of Israel.\\nSyria's state-run SANA news agency said an Israeli airstrike hit a residential building in Damascus Wednesday evening, killing three people and wounding at least three others. An Associated Press journalist at the scene said the missile appeared to have targeted the bottom floor of a four-story apartment building.\\nThere was no immediate comment from Israel, which frequently strikes targets linked to Iran or allied groups in Syria, but rarely claims the strikes.\\nHezbollah says its fighters clashed with Israeli troops\\nHezbollah, widely seen as the most powerful armed group in the region, said its fighters clashed with Israeli troops in two places inside Lebanon near the border. The Israeli military said ground forces backed by airstrikes killed militants in 'close-range engagements,' without saying where.\\nIsraeli media reported infantry and tank units operating in southern Lebanon after the military sent thousands of additional troops and artillery to the border.\\nThe two attacks announced Wednesday followed other assaults on Israeli forces earlier in the year. In June, an explosion in southern Gaza killed eight Israeli soldiers. In January, 21 Israeli troops were killed in a single attack by Palestinian fighters in central Gaza. the deadliest single attack on Israeli forces since Israel-Hamas war erupted.\\nHezbollah also said it fired surface-to-air missiles at an Israeli military helicopter over Beit Hillel in northern Israel near the border. The group did not say whether the helicopter was hit, and there was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.\\nThe Lebanese army said Israeli forces advanced some 400 meters (yards) across the border and withdrew 'after a short period,' its first confirmation of the incursion.\\nThe Israeli military has warned people in and around 50 villages and towns to evacuate north of the Awali River, some 60 kilometers (37 miles) from the border and much farther than the northern edge of a U.N.-declared zone intended to serve as a buffer between Israel and Hezbollah after their 2006 war. Hundreds of thousands have already fled their homes.\\nIsrael has said it will continue striking Hezbollah until it is safe for tens of thousands of its citizens displaced from homes near the Lebanon border to return. Hezbollah has vowed to keep firing rockets into Israel until there is a cease-fire in Gaza with Hamas.\\nIsraeli strikes have killed over 1,000 people in Lebanon over the past two weeks, nearly a quarter of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry.\\nMeanwhile, Israel lashed out at the United Nations on Wednesday, declaring Secretary-General António Guterres persona non grata, or banned from entering the country. Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz accused him of failing to unequivocally condemn Tuesday night's Iranian missile attack.\\nGuterres released a brief statement after the barrage that read: 'I condemn the broadening of the Middle East conflict, with escalation after escalation. This must stop. We absolutely need a cease-fire.'\\nThe move deepens an already wide rift between Israel and the United Nations.\\nPalestinians describe massive raid in Gaza\\nThe Health Ministry in Gaza said at least 51 people were killed and 82 wounded in the operation in Khan Younis that began early Wednesday. Records at the European Hospital showed seven women and 12 children, as young as 22 months old, were among those killed.\\nAnother 23 people, including two children, were killed in separate strikes across Gaza, according to local hospitals.\\nThe Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\\nResidents said Israel had carried out heavy airstrikes as its ground forces staged an incursion into three neighborhoods in Khan Younis. Mahmoud al-Razd, who had four relatives among those killed, described heavy destruction and said first responders had struggled to reach destroyed homes.\\n'The explosions and shelling were massive,' he told The Associated Press. 'Many people are thought to be under the rubble, and no one can retrieve them.'\\nIsrael carried out a weekslong offensive earlier this year in Khan Younis that left much of Gaza's second-largest city in ruins. Over the course of the war, Israeli forces have repeatedly returned to areas of Gaza as fighters have regrouped.\\nOn Oct. 7, Hamas-led terrorists killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took around 250 hostage. Some 100 have not yet been released, around 65 of whom are believed to be alive.\\nIsrael's retaliatory offensive has killed over 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters but says a little more than half were women and children. The military says it has killed over 17,000 fighters, without providing evidence.\\nIran fires missiles to avenge attacks on militant allies\\nIran launched at least 180 missiles into Israel on Tuesday in what it said was retaliation for a series of devastating blows Israel landed recently against Hezbollah, which has been firing rockets into Israel since the war in Gaza began in solidarity with Hamas.\\nIsraelis scrambled for bomb shelters as air-raid sirens sounded and the orange glow of missiles streaked across the night sky.\\nThe Israeli military said it intercepted many of the incoming Iranian missiles, though some landed in central and southern Israel and two people were lightly wounded by shrapnel.\\nSeveral missiles landed in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, killing a Palestinian worker from Gaza stranded in the territory since the war broke out.\\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to retaliate, saying Iran 'made a big mistake tonight and it will pay for it.'\\nU.S. President Joe Biden said his administration is 'fully supportive' of Israel and that he's discussing with aides what the appropriate response should be.\\nIran said it would respond to any violation of its sovereignty with even heavier strikes on Israeli infrastructure.\\nIran said it fired the missiles as retaliation for attacks that killed leaders of Hezbollah, Hamas and its own paramilitary Revolutionary Guard. It referenced Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Guard Gen. Abbas Nilforushan, both killed in an Israeli airstrike last week in Beirut. It also mentioned Ismail Haniyeh, a top leader in Hamas who was assassinated in Tehran in a suspected Israeli attack in July.\\nOriginally Published:\",\n",

David Paterson and his stepson on the Upper East Side.\\nThe boys surrendered to police with their parents Saturday night, a day after the clash near the former governor's apartment. A third teen also surrendered but has not been charged.\\nThe teens' names have not released by cops because they are underage.\\nPaterson recounted the assault in a press conference Saturday afternoon, describing how he and his stepson fought off a group of about nine people after his stepson quarreled with some of the attackers earlier in the evening.\\nPaterson, 70, who is legally blind, and his 20-year-old stepson Anthony Sliwa — the son of Guardian Angels founder and former mayoral candidate Curtis Sliwa — were walking on Second Ave. about 8:30 p.m. Friday when the group confronted them near E. 97th St., cops said.\\nAbout 45 minutes earlier, Sliwa was out by himself walking his dog, Bella, and argued with three members of the group after spotting them scaling a fire escape on the side of a building, Paterson said.\\nPaterson and Sliwa were headed to the McDonald's when the same three confronted them, flanked by about six others, Paterson said.\\nThey argued, and a woman, who Paterson estimated to be at least in her 30s, confronted his stepson, then threw the first punch, the former governor said.\\n'This just wasn't an incident involving young people who were getting out of hand,' he said.\\nThe young Sliwa, who was scheduled to take his purple belt test at the Guardian Angels' martial arts dojo this week, held his own but soon became overwhelmed by the number of attackers.\\n'I got punched in the face a couple times and I got punched in the shoulder,' Paterson said. 'But the person who punched me on the shoulder, I threw them against the McDonalds window myself.'\\nPaterson suffered bruises and some pain to his head. Sliwa, also battered and bruised, received a cut lip that required five stitches, Paterson said.\\nThe NYPD early Saturday released surveillance footage of five suspects in the hopes someone would recognize them.\\nIt wasn't immediately clear if the two teens arrested were included in those photos.\\nCops are asking anyone with additional information to call Crime Stoppers at (800) 577-TIPS.

The $80 million sought in the lawsuit will go towards medical costs, he added.\\n'There is no amount of money that can make up for the harm that Gregory has suffered – we can only hope to make his life more manageable by providing him with enough resources to take care of all of his medical needs,' his attorney Nick Liakas said in a statement.\\n'The NYPD caused irreparable harm to this innocent bystander and to avoid further tragedy, major policy changes must be considered, including eliminating the use of highly ineffective Tasers on civilians.'\\nThe stray police slug pierced the left side of Delpeche's head and exited, possibly leaving bullet fragments in his skull, doctors told his shocked family.\\n'He's still in intensive care. … He's sedated,' Delpeche's cousin Greg Nougues, 57, told the Daily News after the shooting. 'They had to open up the cranium so his brain could swell, so they could operate.'\\nA second subway rider, a 26-year-old woman, was also struck by a stray NYPD bullet during the shooting and suffered a minor injury.\\nOne of the two cops who opened fire was wounded by friendly fire from his partner and was listed in stable condition.\\nMickles was also shot and critically wounded. He has been charged with assault on a police officer and menacing.\\nThe drama unfolded about 3 p.m. when Mickles, who has a history of mental illness, walked through an open subway gate at the subway station, according to police. Mickles has about 20 prior arrests, including more than a dozen for burglary, plus one for a robbery and one for gun possession, police sources said.\\nTwo 73rd Precinct officers, assigned to the station on overtime as part of an effort to tamp down on subway crime, followed Mickles in a second encounter he had with them within 15 minutes.\\n'At a certain point on the platform, the male mutters the words 'You know I'm going to kill you if you don't stop following me,'' NYPD Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey said at a news conference held on the afternoon of the shooting. Officers Edmund Mays and Alex Wong caught up to Mickles and asked him to take his hands out of his pockets, Maddrey said.\\n'They become aware that he has a knife in his pocket,' the chief said.\\n'They give numerous commands,' Maddrey said. 'The male basically challenges the officers—'No, you're going to have to shoot me.''\\nThe fare beater was within seven feet of the cops — with his knife drawn — when they opened fire, officials said.\\nNougues said it was too soon to know how severe his cousin's brain damage will be.\\n'It's a waiting game now. It's just a waiting game,' said Nougues, who added that Delpeche has been able to move his arms and legs.\\nDelpeche worked as a clerical associate at Woodhull Medical Center, relatives said.\\nA notice of claim is a legal announcement filed if someone is planning to sue the city. The official lawsuit may be filed within the next few months.\\n'The NYPD will review the lawsuit if and when we are served,' an NYPD spokeswoman said Saturday.\",\n",

In the meantime, we encourage each player to ask for interviews outside the locker room during the week.'\\nThe Pro Football Writers of America then responded.\\n'The PFWA appreciates the NFLPA membership following the NFL media policy that has been in place for decades,' the statement read.

       "   'summary': \"A judge on Friday denied Daniel Penny's motion to block prosecutors from showing jurors footage of his statements to police after fatally choking Jordan Neely aboard a subway car in May 2023.\\nManhattan Supreme Court Justice Maxwell Wiley, in a two-page decision, found the voluntary statements were lawfully obtained.\\nPenny, 25, a former Marine from Long Island, is set to go on trial for manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide on Oct. 21 for the May 1, 2023 incident that played out between two stops on a northbound F train — Second Ave., where Neely boarded, and Broadway-Lafayette, where he lost consciousness and never regained it. He's pleaded not guilty.\\nThe videos played in court Thursday show Penny willingly speaking with responding officers at the subway station and shortly after with detectives at the 5th Precinct.\\nPenny told officers at the subway station that he 'just put him out' when asked what happened to Neely. Back at the precinct, he said he didn't mean to hurt Neely, whom Penny dismissively referred to as a 'crackhead,' telling detectives he 'just kind of got him in a hold' in defense of passengers on the train car who became frightened when Neely got on, threw down his jacket and started screaming.\\nHe said he believed Neely was going to kill people and did not recall seeing the victim putting his hands on anyone.\\nPenny said he tightened his grip when a 'squirming' Neely summoned 'a little bit of energy' and let up when two fellow passengers aided him, clashing with widely viewed bystander footage. Prosecutors allege Penny subdued Neely in a chokehold for at least six minutes, including after he stopped moving.\\nNeely, who was unarmed, was pronounced dead at the hospital. The city Medical Examiner's office determined the cause was homicide by chokehold. His loved ones have said he struggled with his mental health, homelessness, grief from his mother's murder, and brushes with law enforcement. In better times, he performed for New Yorkers as a Michael Jackson tribute artist.\\nPenny's attorneys had argued that his statements were inadmissible because they were made during what they called an illegal arrest, accusing police of misleading him into believing he had to talk to them. Prosecutors contended that the footage showed Penny knew he was not being detained.\\nWiley agreed and found Penny's remarks at the subway station responded to basic investigatory questions from officers, 'some of whom were performing emergency tasks such as providing medical aid to an apparently unconscious person on at the scene.'\\nHe said Penny was adequately informed of his rights at the precinct, which he waived, and that detectives' questions about his time in the Marines, which the defense framed as manipulative, 'did not constitute the functional equivalent of interrogation as such questions were not reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.'\\n'The questioning was done without force or coercion or promises,' the judge wrote.\\nA spokesman for Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg, whose office is trying the case, declined comment. Penny's lawyer, Thomas Kenniff, could not immediately be reached.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Country music star Garth Brooks took to the stage in Las Vegas Thursday night, hours after a makeup artist accused him of rape and sexual harassment in a new lawsuit.\\nBrooks' sold-out show was part of his residency at The Colosseum at Caesars, which began in May 2023 and is set to run until early 2025.\\nFollowing the show, the 62-year-old country crooner shared a heartfelt message on Instagram alongside a photo of him performing for fans inside the packed venue.\\n'If there was ever a night that I really needed this, TONIGHT was that night!' he wrote. 'Thank you for my life!!!!!'\\nIn a lawsuit filed in California earlier in the day, a woman identified as Jane Roe said she worked as a hairstylist and makeup artist for the 'Friends in Low Places' singer, starting in 2017. The alleged abuse, however, did not begin until two years later.\\nIn 2019, Brooks and Roe flew to Los Angeles so that he could record a Grammy Award tribute performance for Sam Moore. She said she found it odd they were the only two people on the private jet to L.A. that day, and she was further troubled when she learned Brooks had only booked one hotel room with a single bed.\\nWhen they arrived, Roe said the country star started making sexual advances almost immediately, appearing at one point 'in the doorway to the bedroom, completely naked' before raping her, according to the suit.\\n'She was helpless to move from his grip and terrified at what was happening to her,' the documents said.\\n'While he held her upside down, dangling by her ankles — all the blood rushed to her head, causing her to be dizzy and sick,' the suit continued. 'While Brooks forcefully penetrated her, he said perverted things to Ms. Roe about his sexual prowess.'\\nRoe said she continued to work for Brooks after the alleged rape, but did so only because she was having financial issues and needed the work. In the months and years that followed, Roe said Brooks frequently detailed his sexual fantasies for her and often physically groped her. He also allegedly made 'repeated remarks' about 'having a threesome' with his wife, Trisha Yearwood, and showed Roe his genitals.\\nThe suit additionally outlines another incident from 2019, when Brooks allegedly walked out of the shower naked, 'grabbed her hands and forced them' onto his genitals, while using sexually explicit and vulgar language. Roe said she'd been at his home for work at the time.\\nThe Country Music Award winner has since hit back at the allegations against him, denying any wrongdoing.\\n'For the last two months, I have been hassled to no end with threats, lies, and tragic tales of what my future would be if I did not write a check for many millions of dollars,' he said.\\n'It has been like having a loaded gun waved in my face,' Brooks continued. 'Hush money, no matter how much or how little, is still hush money. In my mind, that means I am admitting to behavior I am incapable of — ugly acts no human should ever do to another.'\\nAccording to the complaint, Brooks filed a preemptive legal action in Mississippi last month under the name John Doe, seeking to stop Roe from suing him. He accused her of attempted extortion, defamation and infliction of emotional distress. He added that her impending lawsuit would unfairly damage his reputation given it is rife with 'false allegations.'\",\n",

Just 11% said they strongly approve of the job he's doing as mayor.\\nCalls from progressive and conservative lawmakers for Adams' resignation followed his indictment, with many saying the mayor can't successfully lead the city while he's battling federal charges.\\nGov.

Buzbee said the alleged victims were between 9 and 38 years old when they were assaulted across a 20-year period spanning the 2000s and 2010s, the Washington Post reported\\nMany of the younger accusers had been 'seeking TV or music careers' and were allegedly manipulated by Diddy, who promised to help them thrive in the entertainment industry, Buzbee added.\\nThe Houston-based attorney told Law & Crime the complaints are ready for filing, but that his team wants to ensure they include 'every potentially liable party,' including 'any entities or other individuals that were either involved, participated [in], facilitated, egged on, provided the venue [for] or profited from' Diddy's alleged crimes.\\nMost of the new cases will likely play out in courtrooms in New York and Los Angeles, Buzbee said. He added they will implicate 'many powerful people' and make public 'many dirty secrets.'\\nThe latest series of lawsuits were announced just under a year after Diddy's ex-girlfriend Casandra Ventura accused him of sexual abuse and rape during their yearslong relationship.\\nThat complaint, filed in New York City in November 2023, was the first brought against Diddy. While it was settled just one day later, it sparked an outpouring of similar accusations against the rapper. Since then, he has been named in 11 additional suits, most of them detailing allegations of rape, sexual assault, physical abuse and drugging.\\nThe announcement of the newest suits also came after Diddy's arrest in NYC last month — the result of a lengthy investigation carried out by Homeland Security, which saw agents raid Diddy's homes in L.A. and Miami in connection with drug and sex trafficking allegations.\\nHe was taken into custody at the Park Hyatt Hotel in Midtown on Sept. 16 and has since pleaded not guilty to felony counts of racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution.\\nAt the center of the accusations brought against Diddy are his infamous 'freak off' sex parties, which allegedly involved degrading and physically abusive acts that were often recorded.\\nAccording to a federal indictment in the case, the rapper 'abused, threatened and coerced women and others around him' into participating in the illicit hotel room parties.\\nHe has repeatedly been denied bail and remains behind bars at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn.\\nWhile Diddy has denied most of the allegations leveled against him, he admitted in May to assaulting Cassie after violent footage of a 2016 incident in a hotel hallway was obtained and published by CNN.\\n'My behavior on that video is inexcusable,' he said in a video statement posted on Instagram. 'I take full responsibility for my actions in that video.'\",\n",

       "   'excerpt': 'The Houston Comets remain as the only WNBA franchise to achieve a three-peat.',\n",
       "   'summary': \"It was difficult not to think of last year's Game 4 of the WNBA Finals while watching Sunday's Game 4 of the semifinal round.\\nLast year, Breanna Stewart came up short — 3-of-17 in that elimination game — and went into the offseason with the weight of disappointment on her shoulders.\\nAnd Sabrina Ionescu was limited while dealing with a hip injury sustained in the prior series.\\nOn Sunday, the duo corrected those wrongs. They led the Liberty to a 76-62 victory over the Las Vegas Aces to eliminate the two-time defending champions.\\nThe dreams of an Aces three-peat are over. Becky Hammon's team was unable to become the second team in WNBA history to force a decisive Game 5 after being down 2-0 in a best-of-five series. Sandy Brondello's 2018 Phoenix Mercury squad is the only team to do so.\\nAnd the most talked about piece of history remained: no team in WNBA history has ever come back from a 2-0 deficit.\\n'We haven't done anything yet,' Stewart said after being asked what her thoughts were after winning the series, 3-1. She later emphasized that she's experiencing: 'the feeling of not being satisfied.'\\n'This was a tough series, an emotional series for a number of different reasons. But we're going to the finals.'\\nThe No. 1 seed Liberty now await the winner of the Connecticut Sun-Minnesota Lynx series.\\n'We're hosting Game 1 and Game 2,' Stewart said. 'We'll see who we play but we're ready to go.'\\nAfter scoring just nine points in a miserable Game 3, Ionescu contributed a game-high 22 points, seven rebounds and two assists. Stewart recorded 19 points, 14 rebounds and five assists. But three of her four blocks in the final period loomed large in her team's push to a second straight WNBA Finals berth.\\nShe got two on Kelsey Plum within a minute then Ionescu followed up with a trey at the 5:47 mark to cap seven unanswered points that put the Liberty up 11. Jonquel Jones ' trey with under five minutes to go made it a 10-0 run. Leonie Fiebich 's free throws with 3:38 left in regulation pushed the run to 12 unanswered and the lead to 16.\\nAt that point victory was close, but Stewart's final block over MVP winner A'ja Wilson at the 2:27 mark surely took the air out the arena. The defensive performance was part of a fourth quarter where the Aces went scoreless for four and a half minutes.\\nThe conclusion of Sunday's second half was completely different to Game 3. In Thursday's loss, the Aces dropped 52 points in the final two quarters. The number shrunk to 24 in Game 4.\\nThe Liberty's scramble defense was the difference, per Stewart.\\n'We might have put ourselves in a 2-on-1 situations, but in Game 3, they got easy looks,' Stewart said. 'In Game 3, they got walk-up threes. [In Game 4] we had higher pickup points and made sure that no matter what we want to get them a contested shot.'\\nThe adjustment worked and kept hope alive for the franchise's first WNBA title.\\nThe one-sided finish felt awfully different than the start of the game.\\nJackie Young continued where she left off in Game 3 with a trey to put the first points on the board. But the Liberty responded with a 10-0 run in the opening quarter. After Young's made first shot, the Aces missed seven straight, including three missed Young layups — an issue Hammon complained about after Game 2.\\nThe Libs led by as many as eight points in the first, getting a resurgence from Ionescu after her Game 3 dud. Ionescu surpassed her Game 3 point total within the first few minutes and eventually shot 4-of-4 (including three made treys) for 12 points in the opening period.\\n'Just continuing to read the game. Understanding what I didn't do well last game and being able to adjust quickly,' she said after her bounce-back game. Ionescu noted higher screens helped getting her open Sunday.\\n'Thankfully my teammates found me,' she added.\\nBut the Aces fought back and shortened the deficit to four going into the second.\\nLiberty went on another 8-0 run leading to the team's first double-digit lead midway through the third.\\nThe Aces still crawled back into the game — like two-time defending champions are supposed to do.\\nFiebich gave her opponents a break after recording her third foul with 5:06 remaining in the second. Then Jones — like she did in Game 3 — got into foul trouble again after a questionable decision to hold Wilson on a paint entry feet away from the basket.\\nThat forced two of Brondello's best, lengthy defenders to the bench while the Aces fought for their lives.\\nFiebich's absence showed and so did Jones'. While being fronted by the much smaller Kayla Thornton, Wilson sealed, received an entry pass and drew a foul to get to the charity stripe. Wilson, who finished with a team-high 19 points and 10 rebounds, shortened the deficit to one, but Stewart's tip made the score 41-38 going into halftime.\\nNow it was gut check time.\\nThis was the same juncture the Liberty were within striking distance before getting demolished, 21-6, in the third quarter of Game 3. In that matchup, the Liberty looked lifeless and succumbed to the pressure inside Michelob Ultra Arena.\\nOn Sunday, they looked shaky with three turnovers in the first few minutes (five overall in the quarter). And they were forced to weather the storm with Jones and Fiebich on the bench due to foul trouble. Sloppy possessions on both ends — jump balls, traveling violations and missed free throws — led neither team to go into the fourth with momentum. Brondello's squad managed to narrowly lose the quarter, 13-12.\\nAnd luckily for the Libs, Young's buzzer-beating half-court heave that shook the home arena and would've given her team a one-point advantage was wiped off after official review. And the Liberty entered the final period up, 53-51.\\nThen the Aces collapsed. They lost the final period, 23-11. There was no patented Wilson takeover. Overall, the Liberty limited them to 5-of-16 shooting in the final period.\\nThe Houston Comets remain as the only WNBA franchise to achieve a three-peat.\\nThere will be a new champion in 2024.\\nGame 1 of the WNBA Finals begins Thursday at Barclays Center.\\nOriginally Published:\",\n",

However, authorities still didn't have a good guess at how many people remained missing in the area.\\nPresident Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris saw the devastation firsthand on Wednesday. The president flew over western North Carolina in a helicopter before delivering a speech in Raleigh.\\n'Our job is to help as many people as we can as quickly as we can and as thoroughly as we can,' he said. 'We're not leaving until you're back on your feet completely.'\\nThe federal government is expected to cover repair and rebuilding costs throughout the region. Harris made similar promises Wednesday in Georgia.\\nAdditionally on Thursday, labor authorities announced an investigation into how multiple people were killed at an Impact Plastics factory in Erwin. Multiple workers said they were told to keep working even as the storm approached. Eventually, the plant lost power and 11 people were swept away. As of Thursday, four had been confirmed dead.\\nThe death toll from Hurricane Helene is expected to continue rising once authorities gain access to mountainous areas that have been cut off from the outside world. Since Katrina killed more than 1,300 people in 2005, no storm to strike the mainland U.S. has killed more than 200 people.\\nHowever, Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico in 2017, killing an estimated 3,000 people throughout the Caribbean.\\nOriginally Published: October 3, 2024 at 12:49 p.m.\",\n",

They did punch back, needed just three minutes to turn the tide — thanks to three quick Kayla Thornton baskets — and regain the lead at the 6:54 mark.\\nThen on a fast break at 1:15 mark, Breanna Stewart pushed the ball and dished to Thornton who got an and-1 layup on Wilson. After taking a hit from Wilson, Thornton tumbled, flipped and laid on the hardwood before draining the free throw to go up three.\\nThe momentum flipped as well.\\nThe same Gray that put on a show in the first quarter recorded her second turnover in the quarter by losing the ball out of bounds. The Ionescu drained a 24-footer to extend the lead to six.\\nAnd the Aces' best player in Game 1, Plum, capped her awful 1-for-5 shooting period by losing the ball out of bounds, too. Barclays Center erupted with each mistake that helped the Liberty win the second, 24-13. Minutes before halftime, Thornton's easy drive to the lane forced Hammon to call timeout. The head coach quickly ripped her players, visibly angry at the lack of resistance her team started with.\\nThe scolding didn't work, and the Liberty entered halftime up, 46-40.\\nThen came the third period that saw both teams trade buckets. But it was Courtney Vandersloot 's turn to play the star role. Her stretch in the period showed her effectiveness, even in a reduced reserve role.\\nShe took advantage of a lax defense, rolled to the basket, received a Jonquel Jones passed and finished a wide-open layup. Two minutes later, she sized up Jackie Young on a fast break and blocked her layup attempt at the rim. The veteran put the icing on the cake with a trey that put her team up, 67-58.\\nThe Liberty eventually entered the final period up seven. And they escaped with home-court advantage intact. A sweep would be the sweetest revenge after getting their hearts ripped out on their home floor in 2023.\\nThey'll go for it Friday night in Las Vegas.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Democrat Tim Walz and Republican JD Vance are set to face off Tuesday at 9 p.m. in the only scheduled vice presidential debate of the 2024 campaign.\\nFollow along with the Daily News as we provide regular updates on all the political action before, during and after the 90-minute showdown.\\nWhat to expect:\\nThe debate, moderated by Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan, is hosted by CBS News and will be aired live on that network, along with others via simulcast. There will be no studio audience for the clash held at the network's New York studios.\\nUnlike the Trump-Harris debate, the microphones for Walz and Vance will remain on even when it's not their turn to speak, meaning there could be more interruptions or shouting from one candidate or the other.\\nThe two major party nominees are expected to trade barbs with one another as well as attack the opposing presidential candidates, the traditional role of running mates in the campaign.\\nIt's unknown what questions may come up, but Vance will likely be asked about his controversial stance that parents should enjoy more political power than unmarried 'childless cat ladies' and racist false claims that Haitian immigrants stole and ate pets in the city of Springfield, Ohio.\\nWalz will likely be questioned about abortion rights and questions about the way he has described his long service in the Army National Guard.\\nBoth candidates may also be grilled about how they would handle crises like the Iranian attack on Israel earlier Tuesday or the still-unfolding catastrophe caused by Hurricane Helene in the southeast.\\nThe VP debate could play a bigger role in this campaign than other recent races. It's likely to be the last debate between any of the 2024 candidates as former President Trump has so far said he won't take part in a second clash with Vice President Kamala Harris.\\nWalz comes into the debate with an advantage in favorability polls over Vance, who's the least popular veep candidate in modern political history.\\nStill, the audience is likely to be significantly smaller than the nearly 70 million who tuned in for the presidential debate on Sept. 10.\\nThe debate stakes are high as the race for the White House remains neck and neck.\\nSince the first and likely only presidential debate, which most viewers thought Harris won, the Democrat has opened up a modest lead of 3-4% in averages of national polls. But Trump remains locked in a virtual dead heat with Harris in the seven battleground states that will pick the winner.\",\n",

       "   'excerpt': 'While an apple pie is a delicious way to use apples, this fall is a great time to get creative and try some exciting new apple recipes.',\n",
       "   'summary': \"The abundance of sweet and juicy apples in autumn is a tempting sight at grocery stores and markets. While an apple pie is a delicious way to use apples, this fall is a great time to get creative and try some exciting new apple recipes.\\nEmbracing fall with in-season apples\\nBiting into a crisp apple as temperatures begin to cool in September is one of the first signs that fall is on its way. Most apples start to ripen near the end of August and are at their peak for picking from September to November. During these months, apples are generally larger and strike that perfect sweetness.\\nAccording to the U.S. Apple Association, all 50 states grow apples with more than 7,000 different varieties available. They are also the most consumed fruit in the U.S. This means that your grocery store, local farmers' market, roadside stands, pick-your-own orchards and even backyard trees can supply a bounty of apples.\\nAn apple pie is as quintessential for fall as the apples themselves, but the options only start there. Whether you are baking, snacking, making dinner, drinking or even preserving apples, you have nearly endless options for using apples this year.\\nApple desserts beyond pie\\nStriking a balance between sweet and tart that complements the warm, spicy flavors of fall, apples are ideal for baking. Heat them and the texture turns soft, making them a nice addition to pie crusts, breads, muffins and cake.\\nIf you are craving the cinnamon and flakiness of a pie, an apple crumble or apple crisp uses a similar apple filling with a streusel top. Try a microwave apple crisp for a quick and easy, single-serve alternative.\\nApple cake or apple quick bread makes for a delectable breakfast or tea-time treat. The water content in apples also helps contribute to a moist crumb in your baked goods. Apple fritters, a type of donut with diced apple pieces, are a fun fall dessert. If you have applesauce or apple cider, these can also lend a more delicate sweetness and apple flavor to donuts.\\nWhen baking with apples, choosing the best variety will elevate your recipe. The right apple will offer the exact amount of tartness and moisture, and will stay firm while baking rather than turning mushy with the heat.\\nApple dishes for your daily menu\\nA bushel of fall apples can work well in savory dishes. For breakfast, dinner and snacks, apples can bring a new depth of flavor, some crunch and healthy vitamins and fiber.\\nIncorporating apples into breakfast\\nIn addition to baked goods for breakfast, apples work well in apple cinnamon oatmeal. They are also ideal in smoothies, particularly in green smoothies where they will mitigate the bitterness of kale or spinach.\\nDinner and lunch ideas with apples\\nThe sweet flavor of apples can contrast well with the savory flavors of many dishes. This fall, try adding slices of apples to salads. A spinach or kale salad holds up well to apples. A Waldorf salad traditionally mixes apples with celery, grapes, nuts and a mayonnaise-based dressing.\\nAn apple slaw with grated apple and red cabbage can be an addition to sandwiches or a bright side to other dishes. You can also add apple slices to a grilled cheese for a gourmet sandwich with a bit of crunch. Apples go particularly well with a high-quality cheddar or brie.\\nPork is traditionally served with applesauce or stewed apples, but apples also go well with chicken. Try sauteed apples or apple stuffing alongside chicken for an autumnal dish.\\nMany fall soups can use up extra apples, particularly those that will be blended. Adding an apple to butternut squash soup or potato soup can bring an interesting flavor and texture.\\nApples for a sweet and healthy snack\\nA sliced apple is the perfect snack at any time of the day, but there are plenty of ways to get creative as well. Sprinkle a little cinnamon on apple slices or dip slices in peanut butter or yogurt for a little extra protein. Dipping apples in caramel is also an easy sweet treat.\\nApple chips are a crispy snack. Thinly slice apples, lay them flat on a baking sheet, sprinkle them with cinnamon and bake in the oven until crispy. You'll have a healthier snack and baking apples will fill your home with the aromas of fall.\\nPreserving your fall apple haul\\nIf you still have an excess of apples after cooking and baking or want to have apples in winter and spring, there are several ways to preserve them. These methods will allow your apples to last for several weeks in the fridge or even several months on the shelf if you can them.\\nYou can core and dice apples before placing them in a slow cooker or on the stove top with sugar, cinnamon and other spices. For homemade applesauce, cook the apples until soft and mash them to the desired consistency. Alternatively, try a longer cooking time over low heat to reduce the apples to a spreadable apple jam. Use an immersion blender to create a smooth apple butter.\\nYou can also slice your apples and dry them. A food dehydrator works particularly well, but you can also dry apples in the oven. Dried apples will last about six months, giving you a healthy snack throughout the year.\\nGet ready for apple season this autumn\\nBaking an apple pie or two is one of the best ways to celebrate fall. But this year, don't limit yourself to only pie. Head to your local store or orchard, and stock up on apples for savory dishes and creative baking recipes. Bake apple recipes with your favorite flavors and discover new favorites to welcome this fall.\\nGina Matsoukas is the writer, photographer and recipe creator of Running to the Kitchen.

       "   'summary': \"Facts are foundational to good decision-making\\nBasking Ridge, N.J.: To Voicer David Figueroa: I read a lot of these long-winded delusions people write. You summed it up perfectly. The millions of ignorant Americans who support Donald Trump is scary.\\nFacts are facts. I personally make all my decisions in life based on facts. As a result, I was successful in life — masters degree from Rutgers University, vice president of employee benefits for a major corporation that has 50,000 employees. Sometimes I don't like the facts. Nonetheless, to make the best decision, I have to weigh them. I don't create an agenda and then make stuff up to support it. Good luck to people who do that in the real world.\\nI don't affiliate with a party. I review all the facts and vote for who I feel will be the best person to be president. I've voted for Democrats and Republicans. Voting for either party because you are only gonna vote for that party, period, is not smart.\\nMillions want a guy who spends all his time smearing the other candidate and trying to dig stuff up, and when that doesn't work, just makes stuff up. His supporters will tell you that's OK because he's a businessman who has done so much for our country. Please, tell me some of these great things. I'm all ears. I'm open to learning. I'm open to changing my mind if what I'm being told is factual. When I ask for one example of something good, I get insults. I guess they figure that makes them right. Joe Tierney\\nBest behavior\\nAuburndale: The debate has shown that JD Vance can be civil and non-condescending, but usually chooses not to be. Cathi Venis\\nTruth-teller\\nKew Gardens: JD Vance won on substance for the two major concerns of voters: the economy and immigration. Tim Walz gave it his best but the facts were not on his side. He also went low by trashing Trump gratuitously as well. Vance was disciplined and answered the questions posed to him by the moderators — who, surprisingly, did not seek any policy opinions on either the Israel and Ukraine war. However, to their credit, they did expose another lie told by Walz when he claimed he was in China during the Tiananmen Square standoff. Coupled with his other lies, he can now safely be deemed pathological. This election presents a stark contrast in that former President Trump has a record to compare with the nearly four years of Biden-Harris. Honest minds would have to agree that Trump's four years were unequivocally better for the nation. Phil Serpico\\nTrojan horse\\nUtica, N.Y.: The main thing we took away from the vice presidential debate is that JD Vance could be more of a threat to American democracy than Trump is. He's much younger, smarter and slicker than Trump, but equally if not more committed to wrecking our constitutional democracy. There's a reason he wrote the forward to Project 2025. Also, someone should ask Vance his opinion about closing universities. Spoiler alert, he's for it! It's likely that billionaires like Peter Thiel are using Trump to get Vance into the White House as the future of American autocracy. Even more reason for Americans to vote Democrat this November! Jeff and Joan Ganeles\\nStated threat\\nStaten Island: To Voicer Wendy Packus: Actually, Kamala Harris is a better choice for president than Donald Trump. The fact is that countless American lives were lost because of his incompetent response to the COVID-19 pandemic. A second reason for not voting for Trump is that he is promising to get even with everyone who dares to disagree with him. Do you really think such a small-minded person should be president? Eileen Zanelli\\nApplicable\\nBronx: To Voicer Bob Pascarella: You do realize that the adjectives you used to describe your fellow Voicers, or at least the content in this forum, also applies to ex-President Donald Trump, don't you? Just making an observation. William Bradshaw\\nRemove bias\\nBronx: To those who can't contemplate voting for a woman to be president, I ask you to revisit a literary classic, 'To Kill a Mockingbird.' In the final chapters of the book, in order for the lead character to secure a just outcome for the victim, the jurors were challenged to set aside their color bias to accept the ugly reality of the crime and uplift its victim. Fast forward to 2024. In order to see a viable candidate, accept their narrative and look to uplift our country, some of us need to set aside our gender bias and evaluate a contender. Whose vision will support and promote how to successfully execute the experiment of democracy? If you set aside your bias, you will know there are many ways to come to a decision regarding the best candidate, none of which should depend on the cut of a suit or the style of shoe. Pamela Butler\\nTotality of issues\\nSmithfield, R.I.: To Voicer Mary Caggiano: Yes, we agree that inflation is important. The pandemic had much to do with it. The Fed says it's on the way down, so help is on the way. Of paramount importance are our free and fair elections; a government by and for the people, and not for one man and his family. Moreover, kindness, civility and togetherness of our fellow citizens. On Jan. 6, 2021, Don threatened our democracy by trying to stop or at least slow the electoral process. That same day, he advocated violence against his own vice president who he — and by extension, the people — chose in 2016. Entrusting Don with another term as commander-in-chief would be irresponsible. We have a better, more delightful choice in Kamala and Tim. Stephen De Falco\\nUnder their noses\\nFloral Park, L.I.: Funny, the New York state attorney general and the Manhattan district attorney spent money and time investigating Donald Trump (a private citizen), but the investigations should have been taking place right in their own backyard — the NYC mayor's office. I am not saying anyone is guilty, as they need their day in court, but it looks like some type of corruption was taking place with FDNY and NYPD shakedowns and the sheriff's office's shakedowns. Makes one wonder where our elected officials' priorities are. Pay attention, voters! Bob Damato\\nCanceled\\nBrooklyn: For the second year in a row, there will be no Medieval Festival at the Cloisters in Fort Tryon Park in Upper Manhattan. This event, which dated back to the 1970s, was always held on the first Sunday in October and brought together thousands of New Yorkers of every race, gender, ethnic group and religion in a festive day of music, song, dance, jousting, falconry, knightly combat, puppet shows and food, with numerous concession stands selling wares of various types from the Medieval and Renaissance periods. It was especially popular with children and a vital part of what makes NYC special. Thanks to Mayor Adams' sanctuary city policy, coupled with the city's decision to pay nearly $2 billion in 'reparations' for alleged discrimination against minorities on a competitive civil service exam, sacrifices must be made. The Medieval Festival is now just another fond memory of better times in the Big Apple. Dennis Middlebrooks\\nSay their names\\nBrooklyn: Re (' The hostages murdered by Hamas: Say their names,' op-ed, Sept. 6): The Palestinians murdered by Israeli soldiers have names, too. The problem is there are too many to say. Don't forget about the ones raped to death with objects by Israeli prison guards. Jessica Caban\\nNo easy answer\\nMadisonville, Pa.: It seems that every pro-life supporter always talks about saving the lives of the unborn. But what about the pregnant women? Are their lives worth less than that of the child they are carrying? Not every pregnancy has a happy ending. There are some that can have dire consequences for the woman involved. There is no one-size-fits-all approach that works for pregnancy. Each one is slightly different. And I doubt any legislator has anywhere near the amount of experience dealing with pregnancy and possible complications that a medical professional does, so how are they even remotely qualified to legislate the health care that a woman receives? Too many complex issues get dealt with with overly simplified answers. Tom Mielczarek\",\n",

       "   'excerpt': 'Alonso sent the Mets to the NLDS with a bang.',\n",
       "   'summary': \"MILWAUKEE — Pete Alonso had yet to have a signature moment in the postseason. After six years with the only big league team he had ever known, it looked as though the Polar Bear was about to go out with a whimper.\\nInstead, he sent the Mets to the NLDS with a bang.\\nWith the Milwaukee Brewers up, 2-0, in the ninth inning, Alonso came up to the plate to face closer Devin Williams with runners on the corners and one out. Williams threw strike 1 on the first pitch, before throwing three straight balls. On 3-1, Alonso hit a low liner that just barely cleared the right field fence for the biggest home run of his career.\\nA sellout crowd at American Family Field went silent as the reality set in. The Mets eliminated the Milwaukee Brewers with a 4-2 win in Game 3 of the NL Wild Card series. It was their first postseason series win since sweeping the Chicago Cubs in the 2015 NLCS.\\nThe Philadelphia Phillies will host the first two games of the NLDS starting Saturday at Citizens Bank Park.\\nThe Mets went on to score once more in the ninth, with Starling Marte hitting a two-out single to score former Brewers outfielder Jesse Winker. It was a huge insurance run. Left-handed starter David Peterson came out of the bullpen for the save in the ninth with Edwin Diaz having already pitched after the Mets went down, 2-0, in the seventh.\\nHe gave up a leadoff single, but struck out Joey Ortiz and induced a ground-ball double play to Brice Turang, who killed the Mets throughout the regular-season weekend series and in the Wild Card series.\\nThe two teams were scoreless until right-hander Jose Butto replaced left-hander Jose Quintana in the bottom of the seventh. He gave up back-to-back home runs to pinch-hitter Jake Bauers and Sal Frelick. The two-run lead felt like 10 considering the Mets had managed only two hits up until that point, both by Francisco Lindor.\\nWinker was hit by a pitch to lead off the fifth, but otherwise, those were the only baserunners against Tobias Myers through his five-inning outing. The Mets were anticipating the Brewers to go to their bullpen early and often, but Myers, a journeyman right-hander left exposed by Milwaukee in the Rule 5 Draft last winter, was too efficient and too effective to remove, allowing only two hits, both to Lindor, and striking out five.\\nQuintana was less efficient than Myers, but almost equally as effective. He gave up hard contact at the start of the game but mostly kept the ball on the ground. Two of the four hits he allowed were infield singles, and only once a runner went past second. The Brewers stole two bases, but Quintana pitched around them, blanking Milwaukee for six innings.\\nThe veteran lefty allowed four hits and one walk, and struck out five giving the Mets as good of a chance to win as any.\\nThe Brewers went to the bullpen in the sixth for big right-hander Trevor Megill, the brother of Mets' starter Tylor Megill. Still, it was more of the same. Trevor Megill blanked the top of the Mets' lineup. Nick Mears did the same. With Milwaukee up, 2-0, and the crowd energized once again, right-handed ace Freddy Peralta retired the bottom of the order.\\nBut then the Cinderella magic continued in the ninth. It's been a wild ride for the Mets with a condensed schedule over the weekend and a Monday doubleheader in Atlanta, but down to the last inning, they showed they have enough fight to keep winning when it matters.\\nAlonso is set to hit free agency following the conclusion of the World Series, but for now, he's still a member of the Mets.\\nOriginally Published: October 3, 2024 at 10:21 p.m.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Israel makes more war, with total U.S. support\\nLos Altos, Calif.: Israeli airstrikes and targeted raids in southern Lebanon (photo) have already killed more than 1,000 civilians and displaced more than 1 million. Now, Israel is claiming to have launched a ground invasion, though Hezbollah and UN peacekeepers deny such an incursion has begun.\\nThe chaos is escalating, and while President Biden has called for a ceasefire, the mixed signals coming from the U.S. government are troubling. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's conversation with Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant reinforced U.S. support for Israel's actions along the Lebanese border. Meanwhile, the targeted assassinations and bombings suggest that Israel's true aim is to provoke a broader conflict involving the U.S.\\nHezbollah's media sources confirm that while Israeli forces attempted to enter southern Lebanon, they were forced to retreat under heavy firepower. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears more concerned with rehabilitating his shattered image after Oct. 7 than with any sincere pursuit of peace. His government has continually sidelined the Gaza front and opted to expand the war into Lebanon, perhaps believing that escalation will rewrite history in his favor.\\nHowever, this reckless expansion of conflict is not only undermining Israel's standing in the region but is also a direct threat to U.S. interests in the Middle East. Jordan's Foreign Minister, Ayman Safadi, said it clearly: Peace is within reach, but only if Israel ends its occupation and allows for the establishment of a Palestinian state. Netanyahu's refusal to pursue peace leaves Israel on a dangerous path of perpetual war, a path the U.S. should not be enabling. Shame on Biden and Kamala Harris! Jagjit Singh\\nDon't let up\\nWest Hempstead, L.I.: To Voicer Eugene F. Elander: The Bible is replete with instructions on the conduct of war by the Jewish nation. There is a time for war. This certainly meets the description of such a time. Micah's statement notwithstanding, the commandment to conquer our land and destroy those who would kill us takes precedence. With regard to a multi-front war, Israel has fought such wars in '48, '67 and '73, to name a few. Israel had multiple truces with Hezbollah and Hamas. Each broke them after Israel gave into allowing more workers, more supplies and cash sent by countries like Qatar — all used for war, not betterment of the Arab society. With G-d going in front of Israel's brave troops, its enemies have been vanquished. There will be time for peace when our enemies, like America's enemies in WWII, are thoroughly defeated and their societies purged of their maniacal, murderous philosophies. Samuel J. Mark\\nRadiating conflict\\nManhattan: I'm a Catholic and most of my friends are Jewish. When I tell them Netanyahu is the lead recruiter for Islamic terrorists, they look at me in horror. But it's true. Netanyahu has ordered the killing of at least 42,000 Palestinian men, women and children, and don't you know that each family of the fallen has then sworn an oath to destroy Israel. Iran launched dozens of ballistic missiles at Israel, and if just one of those missiles went rogue and destroyed a U.S., Russian or Chinese aircraft carrier, we'd all be cinders and ash in moments. Israel has the right to exist, but not to threaten all life on the planet. Israel must drop its racism against people of color, sit down at the negotiating table, work on a two-state solution and build in all necessary military protections. Otherwise, each escalatory step by Israel will bring us closer to the unimaginable brink. Ron Spurga\\nCircle up\\nMargate, Fla.: Rabbi Joshua Stanton is well-intentioned, but he is wrong (' We can't circle the wagons this Rosh Hashanah,' op-ed, Oct. 2). Since 10/7, communities such as much of academia, progressives in politics and the mainstream media have made clear their enthusiastic support for the antisemitic, genocidal goals of Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran. To not circle the wagons against these Jew-hating communities is to make the same fatal mistake liberal Jews in Germany did after 1933, when they did not circle the wagons against the Nazis. Richard Sherman\\nLegendary longevity\\nScranton, Pa.: What a national blessing that Jimmy Carter, Dick Van Dyke and Mel Brooks have collectively been alive longer than America has been a country. Vin Morabito\\nSaintly statesman\\nHomer, Alaska: No question: Within 50 years or maybe earlier, Jimmy Carter will be celebrated as the equivalent of a Protestant/evangelical saint. History will recognize his genuine accomplishment of delicately balancing the imperatives of faith with public policy. In time, we will realize that the tenor of our present partisan comments is simply a symptom of a passing affliction of hyper-polarized acrimony. Events will surely arise that will cause many more of us to behave like adults. In time, many more of us will also honor real human progress rather than ingrained biases and cherished political ideologies. Gary Carter\\nBehind the times\\nLittle Egg Harbor, N.J.: Once more, we are viewing another successful woman becoming president of another country that we have always viewed as less successful than ours ('New president takes the stage in Mexico,' Oct. 2). There was Indira Gandhi in India moving that country ahead, then Golda Meir making Israel world-known, then Evita in Argentina, and so on. When are we going to become a more enlightened, less misogynistic country? Why are all these countries ahead of us when it comes to the equality we presume to possess when it comes to human rights? Perhaps it is due to all the harping about abortion and not about having women own the rights to their bodies. Rose S. Wilson\\nInked immaturity\\nBrookfield, Conn.: Reality cider, Honest Tea, Orange Jeff Davis, orange menace and Orange R. Kelly. It sounds like it was written by a child. Would someone please take away Voicer Stephen De Falco's crayons and put him down for his nap? I think he's getting cranky. Fred Schoeneborn\\nDetectable dangers\\nHammonton, N.J.: Re ' Home-grown terror ' (editorial, Oct. 1): The Editorial Board writes, 'those who've been banging the drum about some nonexistent migrant danger.' Nonexistent? The numbers released the other day regarding murderers and rapists illegally loose in our country is scary. There are also plenty of military-age men from China and the Middle East invading our country. We have set ourselves up for another 9/11, but obviously to the media, it's more important to cover up for Kamala Harris just like they all covered for President Biden four years ago. Six months ago, there were rumors about replacing Harris on the ticket. Now the media is doing its best to hide her sheer incompetence, even downplaying the danger we are in because of this invasion. William Cook\\nImports' import\\nMilford, Pa.: If the longshoremen strike teaches us anything (' Dock strike hits NYC, E. Coast, Gulf,' Oct. 2), it should be this: If more of the items we depend on were made here, we wouldn't have to worry about supply chains, would we? Robert K. Greco\\nBill the polluters\\nRochester, N.Y.: We are facing two massive climate problems: How do we stop atmospheric and ocean warming caused by years of burning fossil fuels from continuing to cause harmful and expensive weather disasters? How do we pay for the damage that's already happened? Both problems have been caused knowingly by the largest polluters. Solutions, in New York at least, lie in Gov. Hochul's hands. She's falling down on the job of meeting the fully doable and hard-won climate mandate. She's left the Climate Change Superfund Act on her desk unsigned. Hochul must heed Climate Week's call to action. The act will exact only a sliver of fossil fuel producers' profits — just $3 billion per year for 25 years — to help New York pay the enormous repair costs for infrastructure weakened or destroyed by fossil fuel-powered heavy downpours and flooding. That's a small price to pay out of their huge profits. Kanwaldeep K. Sekhon\\nFull accounting\",\n",

       "   'excerpt': 'Iglesias has been important for the Mets beyond just the clubhouse',\n",
       "   'summary': \"MILWAUKEE — The hits keep on coming for Jose Iglesias, both on the field and on the charts.\\nThe Latin pop sensation known as 'Candelita' could have never imagined he would be in this position, batting second and playing second base for the Mets in the postseason, just two days removed from a champagne celebration with his teammates, hearing his hit song played at Citi Field every time one of them hits a home run and even getting a chance to perform it on the field for fans with an entire big league team dancing on the field behind him.\\nNo, he didn't see this coming.\\nThe Mets probably never envisioned him contributing like he did either, but there he was sprinting out of the box after hitting a ground ball to first base Tuesday night in Game 1 of the NL Wild Card series against the Milwaukee Brewers. It should have been the third out in the fifth inning, but Iglesias slid head first into the bag safely, allowing the tying run to score.\\nThe Mets then went on to win 8-4 with a five-run fifth inning.\\n'Every game, it seems like he does something like that,' said shortstop Francisco Lindor. 'He's a special, special player. He competes. Every game, his last two or three at-bats are very quality — high quality — at-bats. He has helped us to be in this position, for sure.'\\nIt was ruled as a base hit, extending his streak to 23 games. The streak extended to 24 games Wednesday when he singled off Frankie Montas in Game 2 and beat out a tag to second base.\\nAnd to think, the 34-year-old veteran could have opted out of his minor league deal with the Mets when he was assigned to Triple-A Syracuse out of spring training. He thought about it, but imagine how differently things would have turned out if he hadn't stayed.\\n'I'm glad I stayed,' an emotional Iglesias told the Daily News this week. 'I'm glad I got the chance to have this opportunity and grab it with two hands.'\\nIt's been a wild season for the Mets, but even wilder for Iglesias. The value he's brought to the team can't be quantified because yeah, you could look at his 137 OPS+ or his +2 OAA, but how can you measure the vibes he's brought to the Mets and to the city of New York with his hit song, 'OMG?'\\nYou can't quantify vibes.\\n'I think he's been one of the bigger players for our team because he brings the energy every day,' said catcher Francisco Alvarez. 'The whole day, he's talking. He's talking, talking. He always has this song on, and he keeps the game fun. He makes it fun for everybody in the clubhouse. He's a great clubhouse guy.'\\nIglesias has been important for the Mets beyond just the clubhouse. When Jeff McNeil struggled at the plate to start the season, Iglesias stepped into the lineup and produced. This gave the Mets flexibility to use McNeil in the outfield when Starling Marte was injured over the summer. When McNeil was injured late in the season, Iglesias stepped in as the starting second baseman.\\nA utility infielder who can play second base, third base and shortstop, Iglesias doesn't fit any sort of analytical mold. It was clear Iglesias had beat out Joey Wendle and Zack Scott in spring training, but the Mets felt otherwise at the time. Instead, he started the season in Syracuse, becoming a mentor to top infield prospect Luisangel Acuña. Iglesias adopted a weighted ball program on the advice of his former teammate in Detroit and Boston, DH J.D. Martinez, to improve exit velocity, knowing it was one of the analytics teams liked to see.\\nOnce the Mets called him up in June, everything changed. He helped the Mets get back into the postseason race with his bat, hitting .500 with runners in scoring position at one point during the season. He finished the regular season with a .375 average and a .902 OPS with RISP.\\n'I think he's a different hitter in this type of era, where it's the homers and it's the walks,' said manager Carlos Mendoza. 'This is a guy that puts the ball in play, and when you put the ball in play, a lot of times good things happen. When you're facing good pitching, you need that, and he's done that.'\\nBeyond what he's done on the field, he's also given the Mets their rallying cry and the fans the song of the summer. The OMG sign, gifted to the Mets by Jerome McCroy or 'Jay Mac,' an artist in Ridgewood, became the Mets' signature celebratory item.\\nIglesias struggles to verbalize what this season has been like for him, not because the Cuban ex-pat's first language is Spanish, but because it's been so rewarding.\\n'Everything that 'OMG' is bringing to the stadium — the energy in the clubhouse and in the stands — that's off the field,' Iglesias said. 'On the field, it got us together as a group. We've come a long way as a group and we understand what it takes.'\\nFor Iglesias, what it takes to win is a hit pop song, elite bat-to-ball skills and a clubhouse of supportive teammates. It's an unlikely story for an unlikely hero.\\nOriginally Published: October 2, 2024 at 8:09 p.m.\",\n",

They robbed drug dealers and conducted 'smash and grab' merchandise heists, prosecutors said.\\nLaw enforcement officers investigating the gang's alleged activities also seized 'large quantities' of illegal firearms as well as dozens of pounds of fentanyl, methamphetamine and heroin, the indictment stated.\",\n",

He was booked on the misdemeanor count and taken to Burbank County jail, where he remained until well after noon. He was eventually released some two hours later.\\nJoe Tacopina, YG's lawyer, said in a statement to USA TODAY that his client 'will be contesting the allegations, and they are just that — merely allegations.'\\nHe added: 'One thing is obvious, YG seems to have a bullseye on his back by certain members of law enforcement and we will be addressing that.'\\nYG's arrest comes just months after the release of his seventh record, 'Just Re'd Up 3, ' back in August.

       "   'summary': \"JERUSALEM (AP) — Israel's multi-layered air-defense system appears to have passed another test after fending off Iran's latest missile barrage.\\nIn Tuesday's night's strike, Iran fired over 180 missiles toward Israel. The attack set off air raid sirens across the country and sent residents scrambling for shelter, but caused only a handful of minor injuries and limited damage, in large part because many were intercepted or landed in open areas.\\nIt was the latest success for an air-defense system that over the past year has intercepted projectiles fired from Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Iran. They have ranged from short-range rockets to medium-range missiles to attack drones to long-range ballistic missiles like those fired Tuesday night.\\nIn Tuesday's attack, the U.S. and Britain said they assisted in shooting down the incoming missiles. Explosions also were seen over the skies of Jordan, though it remains unclear who carried out the interceptions.\\nBut the vast majority of Israel's air defense over the past year has been carried out by Israel itself. Over the decades, Israel has developed a sophisticated system capable of detecting incoming fire and deploying only if the projectile is headed toward a population center or sensitive military or civilian infrastructure. Israeli leaders say the system isn't 100% guaranteed, but credit it with preventing serious damage and countless casualties.\\nHere's a closer look at Israel's multi-layered air-defense system:\\nThe Arrow\\nThis system developed with the U.S. is designed to intercept long-range missiles, including the types of ballistic missiles Iran launched on Tuesday. The Arrow, which operates outside the atmosphere, has also been used in the current war to intercept long-range missiles launched by Houthi militants in Yemen.\\nDavid's Sling\\nAlso developed with the U.S., David's Sling is meant to intercept medium-range missiles, such as those possessed by Hezbollah in Lebanon. It has been deployed on multiple occasions throughout the war.\\nIron Dome\\nThis system, developed by Israel with U.S. backing, specializes in shooting down short-range rockets. It has intercepted thousands of rockets since it was activated early last decade – including thousands of interceptions during the current war against Hamas and Hezbollah. Israel says it has a success rate of over 90%.\\nIron Beam\\nIsrael is developing a new system to intercept incoming threats with laser technology. Israel has said this system will be a game changer because it would be much cheaper to operate than existing systems. According to Israeli media reports, the cost of a single Iron Dome interception is about $50,000, while the other systems can run more than $2 million per missile. Iron Beam interceptions, by contrast, would cost a few dollars apiece, according to Israeli officials — but the system is not yet operational.\",\n",

Hamas' murderous rampage, and the subsequent war, has renewed our sense of vulnerability as a people, both in Israel and in the United States.

       "   'summary': \"A Connecticut woman was arrested for reporting a phony school shooting threat, forcing a huge law enforcement response and a brief lockdown earlier this week, police said.\\nMonica Smith, of Lebanon, has been charged with falsely reporting an incident concerning serious physical injury or death, misuse of the emergency 911 system and second-degree breach of peace, according to a press release from the East Hampton Police Department.\\nShe was taken into custody on Wednesday, but was released a short time later after posting her $50,000 bond.\\nAuthorities received a report on Tuesday of a potential shooting at East Hampton Middle School on Childs Road. When they arrived on the scene just before 12:50 p.m., they were approached by 57-year-old Smith, who told them one of her family members snuck into the building with a firearm.\\nShe claimed the female relative wanted to 'perpetrate an active shooter situation,' East Hampton Police Chief Dennis Woessner told reporters.\\nBoth the middle school and nearby East Hampton High School were immediately placed on lockdown while authorities scoured both buildings for any signs of danger. Officers from surrounding towns, state police and U.S. Marshals also assisted in the response.\\n'Our primary goal was immediately to find the active shooter,' Woessner said. 'Once the primary areas of the school had been searched, we then went door-to-door, opening up the locked doors with our master keys and ensuring everyone in the classroom was accounted for and all the teachers were safe and no additional person was in the classroom.'\\nOfficers ultimately determined there was no threat to either school, nor the community, and the lockdown was lifted.\\nAfter interviewing several witnesses and further investigating the matter, authorities uncovered enough evidence to arrest Smith for making the fake tip.\\nWhile a motive has not yet been uncovered, police suspect Smith's struggles with mental health could be a factor.\\nAn investigation into the incident is ongoing.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"The Philadelphia Eagles are about to have the best week of any NFC East team not named the Washington Commanders.\\nThat's because the Birds are on their bye.\\nChaos reigns at the moment in this famously heated division where the power dynamic constantly shifts.\\nAnd it's not just because rookie quarterback Jayden Daniels has traditional bottom-feeder Washington (3-1) in first place, scoring 30.3 points per game, only one victory short of the Commanders' four-win total for all of last season.\\nIt's also because, while the Giants (1-3) sit alone in last place, the Eagles (2-2) and Dallas Cowboys (2-2) both look capable of having the bottom fall out and joining them in irrelevance.\\nThe ground is just as shaky beneath the feet of head coaches Brian Daboll, Nick Sirianni and Mike McCarthy, respectively, as it appeared entering this pivotal season for all three programs.\\nThe question now is whether Dallas and Philly are capable of catching themselves, or if the carnage is only going to engulf them, too, as the schedule continues deep into October.\\nThe Giants' outlook is bleak.\\nThey have not won the division since their last Super Bowl season of 2011, while the Cowboys have won five NFC East titles in those 12 seasons, the Eagles have won four and Washington has won three.\\nThe Giants are in last place in the entire NFC conference, not just in division.\\nJoe Schoen's roster is weak. Star rookie receiver Malik Nabers (concussion) looks like he's going to miss Sunday's game in Seattle. Player discontent is palpable.\\nAnd an upcoming stretch against the Seahawks, Bengals, Eagles and Steelers realistically could drop the Giants to 1-7 before a Washington rematch and a Week 10 trip to Germany to potentially battle the Carolina Panthers for next April's No. 1 overall pick.\\nThere is a resigned acceptance of the Giants' place from their frustrated fan base, though, having finished in third or fourth in the NFC East in six of the past seven seasons.\\nThe Eagles, who won 25 of their 34 regular season games the past two years, are in a more constant state of drama due to the disparity between their expectations and reality.\\nSirianni's lack of solutions, quarterback Jalen Hurts' regression and the concerning dynamic between the coach and QB are drawing most of the scrutiny, justifiably in many respects.\\nHurts' dismissive postgame remark in Tampa that he and Sirianni 'have our moments' was nothing short of undermining.\\nBut GM Howie Roseman should not be skating for the defensive personnel he has put on the field. The talent and execution levels for the most part are embarrassing and way below the standard Roseman and that organization has set in recent years.\\nThey're allowing 365.8 yards (29th in NFL) and 24 points (23rd) per game.\\nMeanwhile, it should not go overlooked that Hurts said after the Eagles' pathetic loss to the Bucs that he needs to do a better job of communicating what he sees on the field.\\nThat sounded like an indictment of offensive coordinator Kellen Moore's initial plan against Todd Bowles' defense and the Eagles' inability to pivot and react.\\nInjuries to top players A.J. Brown, DeVonta Smith and Lane Johnson played a huge part in the team's Week 4 dud, too. But there will be no excuses when Philly returns from the bye to host the Cleveland Browns, visit the Giants and Bengals, and then welcome old friend Doug Pederson and the Jacksonville Jaguars back to South Philly.\\nNot that the Cowboys have it any better.\\nDallas rescued itself from 10 days of national ridicule with last Thursday night's narrow 20-15 win over the Giants. But they haven't beaten a good team yet. The roster is top heavy.\\nThey commit penalties like humans breathe oxygen. And one strong defensive night against the Giants' pathetic run game does not guarantee that the Cowboys' rush defense (145.8 yards allowed per game) will fare well at the Pittsburgh Steelers and at home against the Detroit Lions before Dallas' bye.\\nThen they have to travel to the San Francisco 49ers coming out of the break.\\nMcCarthy's Cowboys have gone 12-5 in three straight years, but this season's version looks less consistent. Owner Jerry Jones did the coach and team no favors by sitting on his hands this offseason and not signing free agent running back Derrick Henry after last year's home playoff embarrassment to the Green Bay Packers.\\nAnd with a defense that's clearly deficient despite some talent, they will have to be more explosive on offense or the wheels will come off.\\nMcCarthy elevated Dak Prescott's Cowboys offense to first in the NFL in 2021 (31.2 points per game), fourth in 2022 (27.5 points per game) and first again in the league in 2023 (29.9 points per game). Prescott was the MVP runner-up last year.\\nBut right now the Cowboys are only scoring 24.3 points per game, 11th in the NFL, which would be the lowest since their 24.7 per game finished 17th in the NFL in 2020 – when Prescott played only five games and Andy Dalton led most of the rest.\\nMeanwhile, former Dallas defensive coordinator Dan Quinn's Commanders are in first place despite a shaky defense (25.5 points, 257 yards per game allowed), with a favorable upcoming schedule against the Browns, at the Ravens, and then hosting the Panthers and Bears.\\nWho would have thought the best in the NFC East would found in Washington? Better yet, who will join the Giants in the cellar?\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"SEATTLE – Brian Daboll 's temper was boiling at times on the sideline Sunday as his Giants strained to close out a strong performance, with the looming specter of a collapse inching closer to reality as the Seahawks charged back.\\nBut then Isaiah Simmons finished it off.\\nSimmons, a hybrid linebacker who did not play a defensive snap all day, made a dramatic block of Jason Myers' 47-yard, game-tying field goal try. And wide receiver Bryce Ford-Wheaton returned the ball 60 yards for a touchdown and a 29-20 Giants victory at Lumen Field.\\nDaniel Jones threw two touchdown passes, and rookie back Tyrone Tracy Jr. and veteran receiver Darius Slayton each went over 100 yards, to overcome the absences of top offensive weapons Malik Nabers (concussion) and Devin Singletary (groin).\\nA Rayshawn Jenkins 102-yard Seahawks fumble return for a touchdown put the Giants on their heels in the first quarter after Eric Gray coughed the ball up on the goal line.\\nBut Dexter Lawrence (three sacks), Brian Burns and the Giants' defensive line wreaked havoc on Seahawks QB Geno Smith, and Seattle's offense did not score its first touchdown of the game until a Jaxon Smith-Njigba 5-yard score with 2:09 remaining in the fourth quarter.\\nThat touchdown narrowed the Giants' lead to 23-20. And Daboll's offense failed to run the clock out, punting the ball back to Seattle with 1:40 remaining. Simmons was there, however, to save the day.\\nThe Giants (2-3) return home to New Jersey now for two consecutive home games at MetLife Stadium: a Week 6 Sunday night visit from the Cincinnati Bengals (1-4) and a storyline-filled Week 7 test against Saquon Barkley and the Philadelphia Eagles (2-2).\\nThey fly home after scoring a season-high 29 points on Sunday.\\nThey snapped a seven-quarter touchdown drought with a 7-yard Jones TD pass to Wan'Dale Robinson with 9:09 to play in the first half. And Jones hit the Giants' first 40-plus yard pass play of the season: a 41-yard bomb down the right sideline to Slayton, who hauled in eight catches for 122 yards and a touchdown.\\nIt marked Slayton's sixth career 100-yard receiving game.\\nJones then finished that drive off with a 30-yard touchdown pass to Slayton, and the teams traded field goals until the late fourth-quarter flurry.\\nOne of Greg Joseph 's field goals was set up by a Burns fourth down sack of Smith at the Seahawks' 27 yards line with 14:09 remaining in the final quarter.\\nCorner Deonte Banks had a nice bounce-back after getting called out by position coach Jerome Henderson for a lack of effort in last week's loss to Dallas, as well.\\nBanks forced a D.K. Metcalf fumble recovered by Tyler Nubin and had multiple pass breakups.\\nBowen's defense held Seattle's offense scoreless for most of the first half. The Giants looked like they were going to take a 10-7 lead into halftime.\\nBut when the Seahawks got the ball back with 22 seconds to play, Smith promptly completed two passes for 45 yards to Kenneth Walker III and Tyler Lockett.\\nDaboll was red hot on the headset on the sideline as Jason Myers hit a 43-yard field goal to tie the game at 10 apiece heading into the break.\\nThat was a discouraging score considering the Giants had outgained Seattle 225 yards to 90 and converted 15 first downs to the Seahawks' five, but they didn't have a lead to show for it.\\nDaboll's team trailed 7-0 after the first quarter due to Gray's goal line fumble, for example, despite forcing two Seahawks punts and outgaining their hosts, 92 yards to 25.\\nThe offense overcame a Jones fumble on their first play that Thomas recovered at New York's 5-yard line.\\nGray caught screen passes of 18 and 19 yards on back-to-back plays to dig them out, and they took 10 minutes off the clock on the drive. But then Gray coughed up the killer turnover.\\nBowen's defense managed to keep the game steady anyway, forcing three punts on Seattle's first three possessions. Then the offense launched a game-tying, eight play, 81-yard drive capped by a 7-yard Jones touchdown pass to Robinson with 9:09 remaining in the half.\\nA 27-yard run by Tracy Jr. jumpstarted the drive. Rookie tight end Theo Johnson then caught a 22-yard pass, the longest of his young career. And Jones carried for an 11-yard gain to set up Robinson's TD.\\nThe Giants' quarterback was even lowering his shoulder on a couple of his runs to take on defenders.\\nJones and the offense then set up a Joseph 38-yard field goal for the 10-7 lead with 22 seconds remaining in the half, but the defense let its foot off the gas, and Seattle tied the game with that final-minute surge.\\nIt was an inauspicious conclusion to a mostly promising first half otherwise. Daboll's temper was starting to boil, and it nearly unraveled at the end.\\nBut this time the Giants held on. This time they made the plays to win it.\\nOriginally Published: October 6, 2024 at 7:50 p.m.\",\n",

Twice, the Phillies took a lead, only to see the Mets come back and tie the game in the top of the ninth inning when Mark Vientos hit his second home run of the game.\\nBut the Phillies, channeling their inner Rocky Balboa, finished the second round of what is shaping up to be a heavyweight fight of a series, with three runs off the closer in the eighth inning. Tylor Megill walked two hitters with two outs in the bottom of the ninth before giving up a single to Nick Castellanos, and Philadelphia walked it off 7-6.\\nThe series is even at 1-1 as it moves back to Citi Field for Games 3 and 4, starting Tuesday.\\nWith one out and the Mets down by two runs, Francisco Lindor smoked a single up the middle off left-hander Matt Strahm.

That brought up Vientos, who homered off left-handed starter Christopher Sanchez to open the scoring in the third inning.\\nHe botched a transfer with a runner on third in the eighth, allowing the Phillies to score an insurance run.\\nNever mind the dropped ball, Vientos sent this one into the left field stands to score two and tie the game at 6-6.\\nRight-hander Luis Severino and Sanchez gave up two home runs, a two-run blast (Vientos off Sanchez, Bryce Harper off Severino) and solo shots (Pete Alonso off Sanchez, and Castellanos off Severino).\\nWith the Mets up 3-0 in the bottom of the sixth, Severino got the first two outs before Turner singled to left field. While Harper walked to the plate, Francisco Alvarez called a meeting on the mound to talk to give his pitcher a breath. Severino got ahead 1-2 before missing with a fastball, evening it at 2-2. He reached back to 99 MPH on the next pitch — another four-seam fastball, his key pitch — but he left it up.\\nWay up.\\nHarper hit it way back over the center field fence, cutting the Mets' lead to just one run. Castellanos then followed with his own to tie the game at 3-3.\\nThe crowd was back in it. After booing Castellanos for swinging and missing earlier, the Philly faithful celebrated him once again. Citizens Bank Park was practically shaking.\\nSanchez went five innings while Severino went six. They were each charged with three earned runs.\\nNot to be outdone, Brandon Nimmo homered with two outs in the top of the seventh off right-hander Orion Kerkering, putting the Mets ahead once again.\\nThe lead was in the balance in the bottom of the seventh after Jose Butto put two on with two out. The Mets brought in Diaz to face Kyle Schwarber and the top of the order, if he reached base. This was clearly where manager Carlos Mendoza felt the leverage was the highest. The closer is technically the pitcher a manager calls in the highest-leverage innings.\\nIt's one of those moves that makes a manager look good if it works, and angers a fanbase if it doesn't. It's what Buck Showalter did with Diaz in Game 2 of the 2022 Wild Card series. It worked two years ago, and it looked as though it would work this time too.\\nSchwarber battled the right-hander for seven pitches, working the count full before checking his swing on a slider in the dirt. Alvarez blocked it, while the umpires called Schwarber out, saying he went around for strike 3.\\nBut then the Mets went down in order in the top of the eighth and with one out, Diaz walked Harper and gave up a single to Castellanos. With the count full, Bryson Stott drilled a ball to the exact right spot in right field he needed to in order to send home both runners. The Phillies took a 5-4 lead and the Mets pulled Diaz for right-hander Tylor Megill.\\nJ.T. Realmuto sent a chopper to Vientos at third base. He squared to throw home, but he dropped the ball on the transfer and Stott came home safely.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Christopher Ciccone, an artist, dancer and designer whose memoir chronicled a sometimes fractious relationship with his famous older pop-star sister Madonna, has died.\\nHe was 63.\\nCiccone died of cancer on Friday, just days after a 'very aggressive' form of the disease took their stepmother, Joan Ciccone, and less than two years after their brother Anthony Ciccone died at age 66.\\nChristopher Ciccone was a longtime collaborator with his sister, serving as one of her backup dancers during her early career, and working as her show designer and backstage dresser later on. He was also the art director on her Blond Ambition World Tour in 1990, and directed 1993's The Girlie Show tour.\\nAside from working with his sister, Ciccone also directed the 'Peace Train' music video for Dolly Parton and 'God Bless the Child' for Tony Bennett. As an interior designer, he launched the Ciccone Collection of footwear in 2012. Since 2016, he had been married to actor Ray Thacker, who was by his side when he died.\\nCiccone released 'Life with My Sister Madonna' in 2008, dishing about their strained relationship and reminiscing about the times they had toured together.\\nMadonna posted a heartfelt tribute to her sibling, detailing their singular close relationship and its underpinnings, and mourning a near constant companion and supporter.\\n'My brother Christopher is gone,' the pop icon wrote on Instagram, as she sought to chronicle a bond that defied explanation — one that 'grew out of an understanding that we were different and society was going to give us a hard time for not following the status quo,' Madonna wrote.\\nView this post on Instagram\\nA post shared by Madonna (@madonna)\\n'We took each other's hands and we danced through the madness of our childhood, she wrote, calling dance 'a kind of superglue that held us together. Discovering Dance in our small Midwestern town saved me, and then my brother came along, and it saved him too,' with class providing a 'safe space for my brother to be gay, a word that was not spoken or even whispered where we lived.'\\nCiccone followed his sister to New York City, where they continued to dance 'through the madness' of the AIDS epidemic as they devoured art, music and film 'like hungry animals' while being 'in the epicenter of all of these things exploding,' the pop star wrote.\\n'When it came to good taste, my brother was the Pope, and you had to kiss the ring to get his blessing,' she wrote. 'He was a painter a poet and a visionary. I admired him. He had impeccable taste. And a sharp tongue, which he sometimes used against me, but I always forgave him.'\\nTogether they pursued artistic freedom as they 'soared the highest heights together, and floundered in the lowest lows,' his bereaved sister wrote, acknowledging that recent years had not been easy, amid a period of estrangement. But that ended when her brother got sick and 'we found our way back to each other,' Madonna stated. 'I did my best to keep him alive as long as possible. He was in so much pain towards the end. Once again, we held hands We closed our eyes and we danced. Together.'\",\n",

Ron DeSantis said Sunday. 'If you're on that west coast of Florida, barrier islands, just assume you'll be asked to leave.'\\nMilton was expected to increase in strength early in the week — at least to a Category 3 storm — before making landfall around Wednesday, according to the NHC. Exactly where the storm would strike remained unclear Sunday, but DeSantis declared states of emergency in 51 of Florida's 67 counties.\\nMeteorologists predicted 5-8 inches of rain across the state, with some areas seeing as much as 12 inches from Sunday through Wednesday.\\nAdditionally, the storm was expected to kick up a significant storm surge on Florida's gulf coast, putting coastal communities at risk of additional flooding.\\n'You have time to prepare — all day today, all day Monday, probably all day Tuesday, to be sure your hurricane preparedness plan is in place,' DeSantis said Sunday.\\nMany of the communities endangered by Milton were still recovering from Hurricane Helene, which made landfall Sept. 26 near Perry, Fla., about 160 miles north of Tampa.\\nWhile Helene brought its worst devastation to Appalachian communities in North Carolina, it also significantly affected parts of Florida that could be in Milton's path.\\n'This is not a good track for the state of Florida,' DeSantis said. 'From an emotional perspective it's tough. People do get fatigued.'\\nAs of Sunday afternoon, Milton was still much closer to Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula than to Florida. The storm was centered about 815 miles west-southwest of Tampa, according to the NHC.\\nIt was predicted to progress west to east across the Gulf during the week before moving out to the Atlantic Ocean after slamming Florida. Tropical storm-force winds extended 80 miles from the storm's center, forecasters said.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"OVERCOME NABERS' ABSENCE\\nStar rookie receiver Malik Nabers leads the NFL with 52 targets, 35 catches and a 35.9% target share on his team's offensive pass plays. But he's out Sunday with a concussion, so it's not clear how the Giants will put a competitive offense on the field. They don't run the ball well. And while downfield threat Jalin Hyatt will get more opportunities, Brian Daboll has shown a limited willingness to trust Daniel Jones with aggressive calls. He really has no choice but to put this game plan on Jones' arm and legs, and to live with the result.\\nWIN THE TURNOVER BATTLE\\nThe Giants have committed six turnovers to the Seahawks' one in the team's two meetings the past two years. That's the main reason Seattle has outscored New York, 51-20, in the aggregate and won both games. Daboll's team has very little margin for error as it is. The Giants have not scored a touchdown since the first half in Cleveland in Week 3 — a drought of six quarters. If they lose the turnover battle, they can't win. Rookie safety Tyler Nubin is a player to watch here. He was a ball hawk in college at Minnesota but has not forced a turnover yet this season.\\nIMPROVE HALFTIME ADJUSTMENTS\\nThe Giants have outscored opponents, 45-44, in the first halves of games. But they've scored only 15 second-half points in four weeks while allowing 40. Technically, the Giants would have had 22 second-half points if Devin Singletary hadn't slid down to run the clock out on their Week 3 road win in Cleveland. Still, that's not good enough. Geno Smith's Seahawks are not Deshaun Watson's Browns. The Giants didn't score in the second half against the Browns and still won. They will not have the same leeway Sunday.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) — At a busy Tel Aviv entertainment district, diners spill into outdoor seating and clink glasses as music fills the air. There's laughter, there's life. But all around the patrons, staring down from lampposts and shop windows, are pictures of hostages held in Gaza, stark reminders that Israel is at war and forever scarred by the deadliest attack in its history.\\nAs Israel's war with Hamas reaches its one-year mark, it can seem on the surface that much of life in the country has returned to normal. But with many still reeling from Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, hostages remaining in captivity and a new front of war with Hezbollah in the north, many Israelis feel depressed, despondent and angry as the war stretches into its second year.\\nUncertainty over the future has cast a pall over virtually every part of daily life, even as people try to maintain a sense of normalcy.\\n'The conversation about the situation is always there,' said activist Zeev Engelmayer, whose daily postcard project featuring illustrations of hostages or Israel's new reality has become a fixture at anti-war protests. 'Even those who are sitting in coffee shops, they're talking about it, in every single situation I see it. It's impossible to get away from it. It has entered into every vibration of our life.'\\nRattled Israelis feel hopeless\\nHamas' attack in which some 1,200 people were killed and 250 kidnapped shattered Israelis' sense of security and stability in their homeland.\\nMany have been rattled by the war's evolution. Nearly 100 hostages remain in Gaza, with less than 70 believed to be alive. Israelis have experienced attacks — missiles from Iran and Hezbollah, explosive drones from Yemen, fatal shootings and stabbings — as the region braces for further escalation.\\nThey've watched as Israel is accused of committing war crimes and genocide in Gaza and becomes increasingly isolated internationally.\\n'I'm almost 80 — we grew up in this country with a feeling that we have short wars, and we win them quickly,' said Israeli historian Tom Segev, who described new feelings of utter hopelessness. 'We're not used to a long war.'\\nIsraelis have long harbored a sense that their country, born of the Holocaust's ashes and surviving a panoply of regional threats, is a success story, Segev said. They've strived, he added, for a normality akin to that of European and North American people, though their reality for decades has been anything but.\\n'I think that history is going backward,' he said of the past year. 'Everything we have achieved on our way to becoming a normal state isn't happening.'\\nReminders are everywhere. At a Hebrew University graduation in Jerusalem, a large yellow ribbon was placed in front of the stage. A graduate who didn't attend because his brother was killed in Gaza the previous day was honored.\\nInternal divisions grow\\nIsrael's longstanding internal divisions briefly eased in the aftermath of Hamas' attack, but have only intensified since. Weekly protests calling for a cease-fire deal that would free hostages are attended mostly by secular Jewish Israelis who oppose Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government.\\nAccording to a September poll by Jerusalem-based think tank Israel Democracy Institute, 61% of right-wing Jewish Israelis — Netanyahu's base — support the war continuing.\\nOccupied with their own trauma, most Israelis paid scant attention to the ongoing destruction in Gaza, even as the Health Ministry there put the Palestinian death toll at more than 41,000. Israeli media have reported little on the devastation. Israelis calling for a cease-fire are driven overwhelmingly by the hostages' plight.\\nMany Israelis are furious at leaders and the military for not preventing Hamas' attack. Tens of thousands of people are expected at an alternative ceremony marking one year since then, as a statement against the government's official commemoration. The state ceremony is being prerecorded without a live audience, in part because of fears of heckling and disruptions.\\n'The thing we lost on Oct. 7 — and we haven't gotten it back — is our feeling of security,' Muli Segev, executive producer of 'Eretz Nehederet,' a popular sketch comedy show. 'Despite everything, we have been able to create a life here that's pretty open and Western.\\n'Especially in Tel Aviv, we go about our lives, and we don't think about the fact that our lives are really just pauses between wars and between explosions of violence.'\\nIn the war's early months, the show's sketches were gentler, focusing on what united Israeli society, such as the massive civilian volunteer response. Over time, they featured more pointed satire, including a reimagining of negotiations if the hostages were Israeli politicians' children — released in less than two hours.\\nParts of life have rebounded — beaches full of people, bustling cafes, concerts and sports back on schedules. But residents also check for the nearest bomb shelter, deal with school cancellations when violence flares up, and avoid domestic travel hubs that are now off-limits. Heartbreaking news arrives regularly, including the deaths of six hostages in August.\\n'It's a nightmare; we're just getting used to it,' said Maya Brandwine, a 33-year-old graphic designer who witnessed the Jaffa shooting that killed seven on Tuesday. 'I have so little hope. I'm sure the situation will only get worse.'\\nDror Rotches, a 47-year-old graphic designer, said from a Tel Aviv coffee shop: 'We try to go out when we can, meet friends and try to forget for a few hours. Then we go home and keep slogging through the mud.'\\nOthers simply can't return home. More than 60,000 from Israel's northern border with Lebanon are displaced. Thousands from the southern towns ransacked Oct. 7 are in temporary housing. Tens of thousands of reserve soldiers are serving their second or third tour of duty, straining their families and jobs.\\n'As the war goes on and on and we can't see the end, there's also a type of very large worry over the future, and, for some, if there is even a future here,' Muli Segev said.\\nAt this cafe, life meets war\\nCafe Otef seems like any of Tel Aviv's ubiquitous coffee shops: Patrons laugh and sip specialty coffee beside a playground; light rock music plays. But next to the sandwiches and cakes are chocolates made from the recipes of Dvir Karp, who was killed in the Oct. 7 attack, and cheeses from Kibbutz Be'eri, where more than 100 died and 30 were taken hostage. Totes and T-shirts for sale declare 'We shall thrive again.'\\nThe cafe, named for the region next to the Gaza border, is run by residents of Re'im, one of the kibbutzes struck. It's the second shop in the new chain, each aiming to support people of a southern Israeli town where lives were upended.\\n'The war still continues for almost a year, and I feel that if we won't live, we will die,' said Reut Karp, cafe owner and Dvir's ex-wife. She lives with most of her kibbutz in temporary housing nearby.\\nThe cafe gives her purpose as her community deals with trauma and the uncertainty of returning home. While it's strange to see people flowing through the doors, going about life as normal, she and the staff have found comfort in the routine.\\n'We must take ourselves out of bed and continue to live and to work and to have the hope,' Karp said. 'Because without this hope, we don't have anything.'\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Ingrid Lewis-Martin, Mayor Adams' embattled chief adviser, and former state Sen. Jesse Hamilton were joined on their recent trip to Japan by registered lobbyist Adam Clayton Powell IV and Lisa Lashley, a senior City Hall official overseeing hiring efforts, the Daily News has learned.\\nThe trip, which Lewis-Martin has characterized as a vacation, burst into the headlines after The News reported that both she and Hamilton, now a top real estate official in Adams' administration, had their cellphones seized by Manhattan district attorney investigators at JFK Airport last Friday immediately upon returning from Japan.\\nDiana Boutross, a top executive at Cushman & Wakefield, one of the city's largest real estate firms, was also on the Japan trip, as first reported by The News earlier this week. On Friday, sources confirmed Lashley, the director of the mayor's office of appointments, as well as Clayton Powell IV were on the trip, too.\\nIt remains unclear what investigation prompted the DA investigators to take phones from Lewis-Martin and Hamilton at JFK, an action that came the day after Adams was indicted on federal corruption charges stemming from a separate probe into his Turkish government ties. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.\\nA spokeswoman for the mayor said his office doesn't comment on 'personal trips,' and Lashley declined to comment.\\nClayton Powell IV confirmed via text he was with Lewis-Martin and Hamilton in Japan.\\n'Vacation,' he wrote when asked about the purpose of the trip. Clayton Powell IV stopped responding when asked if he was also approached by investigators upon getting back to New York.\\nClayton Powell IV has lobbied a number of top Adams administration officials — including Hamilton — on behalf of private business interests. Before joining him on the Japan trip, Clayton Powell IV earlier this year lobbied Hamilton directly on behalf of Totem Holdings, a construction firm that's seeking to build a homeless shelter in Harlem, city records show.\\nOthers in the Adams administration Clayton Powell IV has lobbied directly on behalf of a variety of private interests in 2023 and this year include the mayor, Deputy Mayor of Public Safety Phil Banks and Tim Pearson, Adams' recently resigned public safety adviser.\\nClayton Powell IV, a Democrat whose tenure as a state Assembly member representing Harlem was marred by multiple scandals, represented a Manhattan district that includes East Harlem between 2001 and 2010.\\nWhile in the state Legislature, Clayton Powell IV drew intense controversy after being arrested for driving drunk in 2008. He later got convicted of a misdemeanor of driving under the influence, was fined $300 and had his license suspended. He didn't run for reelection in the Assembly after the conviction and instead mounted an unsuccessful bid for Congress.\\nYears earlier, also while in the Assembly, a 19-year-old aide to Clayton Powell IV filed a police report in 2004 accusing him of rape. He vehemently denied the accusation and charges were never brought against the lawmaker, who's the son of late Harlem Rep. Adam Clayton Powell, Jr.\\nBoutross' firm, Cushman & Wakefield, is one of the city's largest real estate firms.\\nCity records show the firm holds multiple contracts worth tens of millions of dollars with the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, the agency where Hamilton serves as deputy commissioner for real estate services, a post that comes with overseeing the city government's sprawling property holdings.\\nLewis-Martin's detailed schedules, obtained by The News via a Freedom of Information Law request, show she met privately multiple times with Boutross in 2022 and 2023 on official business.\\nA half dozen of Adams' top advisers had their homes raided and electronics seized by federal authorities on Sept. 4 as part of a swirling set of corruption investigations. Several of those aides have since announced their resignations, including Schools Chancellor David Banks and Pearson.\\nAt the same time as Lewis-Martin's phones were confiscated at the airport, her home in Brooklyn was raided by DA investigators as part of the same probe, the focus of which remains unclear.\\nFederal investigators also served Lewis-Martin with a subpoena at the airport requesting her to testify before a grand jury in connection with the Turkey investigation that resulted in the mayor's corruption indictment. She hasn't been publicly accused of wrongdoing by any investigators to date, and neither has any of her Japan trip companions.\",\n",

He was also convicted of a charge of conspiracy to witness tamper.\\nBean and Smith were acquitted of civil rights charges.\\nThe witness tampering charges carry possible sentences of up to 20 years in prison. They faced life in prison if convicted of the most-serious charges.\\nFormer officers Emmitt Martin III and Desmond Mills Jr. previously pleaded guilty to using excessive force and conspiring to witness tamper and testified for the prosecution.\\nAll five ex-officers are Black. Each was fired after the beating.\\nNichols, 29, a Black man, was pulled over by Martin the night of Jan. 7, 2023. Martin claimed Nichols was driving recklessly.\\nIn footage released by the city, Martin and Haley approached with guns drawn before pulling Nichols from the car and wrestling with him and pepper spraying him.\\nAt some point, Nichols got loose and ran from the scene as Preston Hemphill, a white former officer who was not charged, fired his Taser.\\nIt's unclear if he was hit, but other officers tackled Nichols and starting punching, kicking, pepper spraying and hitting him with batons. He was eventually handcuffed and placed against a police car where footage shows him slumping over as the officers laugh.\\nHe was taken to the hospital in critical condition and was placed on a ventilator, but died three days later.\\nThe incident led to two Justice Department reviews of the Memphis Police Department's practices.\\n'Tyre Nichols should be alive today,' Assistant U.S. Attorney General Kristen Clarke said. 'We hope this prosecution provides some measure of comfort as the law enforcement officers tied to his death have been held accountable.'\\nA sentencing hearing was scheduled for Jan. 22, 2025.\\nThe five officers have also been charged with second-degree murder in state court, but no trial date has been set.\\n'Today, justice has prevailed for Tyre Nichols and his family,' civil rights attorneys Ben Crump and Antonio Romanucci said in a statement.\\n'We hope this moment serves as a reminder that our fight for justice for Tyre is far from over. We will continue to push for justice in the state criminal case and the civil case, so that no family has to endure this kind of heartache again.

       "   'summary': \"A former New Jersey child protection caseworker has been indicted for his alleged sexual abuse of two children, officials announced Thursday.\\nTrent Collier, a native of Newark who most recently was living in Savannah, Ga., has been charged with sexual assault, aggravated criminal sexual contact and other offenses based on his alleged conduct involving two minor victims, Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin said in a news release.\\nThe 58-year-old was employed for roughly two decades as a caseworker for the state's Division of Child Protection and Permanency, the child welfare agency within the New Jersey Department of Children and Families.\\nWhile his job was to empower and protect at-risk children, Collier betrayed their trust by misusing his position to 'exploit those who needed advocacy and protection the most,' Platkin said in a statement.\\nAn investigation found Collier sexually assaulted the first victim while he served as the DCCP caseworker for the victim's family, according to the attorney general.\\n'Collier allegedly verbally and physically threatened the victim that they would be removed from their family if they disclosed the abuse,' which allegedly took place while he was at work, with several instances occurring inside a DCPP office.\\nCollier later 'leveraged his position … to facilitate the sexual abuse' of a second victim, including the use of his DCPP vehicle to carry out the assaults. Investigators found Collier offered money to that victim to keep them quiet.\\nThe attorney general did not release the age of either victim.\\nCollier is being held in custody as he awaits trial. If convicted on all charges, he could be sentenced to up to 50 years in prison.\\nEarlier this year, Collier pleaded guilty in Newark federal court to one count of possession and one count of transportation of child pornography.\\nHe's scheduled to be sentenced on those charges Oct. 10. He faces up to 40 years in prison. Each count also carries a fine of at least $250,000.\",\n",

Mike Lawler says he's sorry for wearing blackface as part of a Michael Jackson costume when he was in college nearly two decades ago.\\nThe first-term Westchester lawmaker, who's locked in a tight reelection fight, admits it was a mistake to don the offensive dark makeup at a 2006 Halloween party while he was a student at Manhattan College in the Bronx.\\n'That is not something I would do today and certainly understand why people would be upset or offended by it, and for that, I'm sorry,' Lawler told CNN Thursday night.\\nLawler noted that he is a big fan of Jackson and did not mean to insult anyone. The incident was first revealed by the New York Times, which obtained photos of the college party.\\n'The ugly practice of blackface was the furthest thing from my mind,' Lawler said in a statement. 'Let me be clear, this is not that.'\\nAs a high school senior, Lawler even journeyed to Los Angeles to support the late pop superstar during his 2005 trial on child sex charges. Jackson was acquitted.\\nLawler's Democratic opponent in the November election, ex-Rep. Mondaire Jones, did not immediately comment on the controversy.\\nThe two men are locked in a tight contest for the suburban seat, which Jones previously held before unsuccessfully switching to run in a different district after a round of redistricting-induced political musical chairs in 2022.\\nThe Westchester race is being closely watched around the country because Lawler is one of a dwindling number of relatively moderate Republicans representing suburban swing districts.\\nThe suburbs have mostly shifted sharply towards Democrats nationwide in the era of former President Trump, although the GOP successfully flipped several Democratic-held seats in the New York metro area in 2022.\\nDemocrats hope to flip back at least five GOP seats in New York and suburban New Jersey in the November election, including the one held by Lawler.\",\n",

His lead attorney, Alex Spiro, said he intended to file a full dismissal motion on Wednesday.\\nThe Manhattan U.S. attorney's office alleges Adams allowed himself to be bought by the Turkish government and wealthy businessmen for nearly a decade, starting when he was Brooklyn borough president.\\nHe's accused of accepting more than $100,000 worth of business class air travel to countries including Turkey, Ghana, France, and India, luxury hotel stays, meals, and transport, and illegal campaign contributions from Turkish nationals funneled through U.S. donors.\\nAdams squeezed the secret Turkish donations for more cash through the city Campaign Finance Board's matching public funds program and included them in a tainted pot of $10 million in contributions falsely certified as legally raised in 2021, prosecutors allege.\\nIn exchange, he threw his weight around for his benefactors, the feds say, promoting Turkish government and business interests in the city, including pressuring FDNY officials to bypass safety checks to hurriedly open Turkey's 36-story consulate by the U.N. in time for the president's visit.\\nIn his bid to toss the bribery count, Adams' lawyer cited a recent Supreme Court decision that loosened up public corruption laws by finding it illegal for officials to accept bribes before taking action but OK to accept 'gratuities' after the fact.\\nSpiro said the luxury travel benefits the mayor received were equivalent to gratuities and described his involvement in the consulate's opening as 'normal and perfectly lawfu l.' He threw Adams' Turkish liaison-turned-government informant, Rana Abbasova, under the bus in another part of Monday's filing, claiming the case is based on her lies.\\nAbbasova is among at least a dozen senior Adams staffers, past and current, enveloped in swirling criminal investigations into his office by state and federal prosecutors, leading to a steady drumbeat of high-profile resignations in recent weeks. On Monday, his embattled senior adviser, Tim Pearson, became the latest to hand in his resignation letter.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"General Daily Insight for October 02, 2024\\nWe're finding a happy medium. With the peaceful New Moon in Libra at 2:49 pm EDT, we're seeking balance in our lives by increasing friendship and love in our circles. As the Moon joins with communicative Mercury, we have opportunities to communicate our feelings, expressing ourselves in ways that we might have been holding back before. When the Moon struggles with serious Saturn, it could be difficult to take criticism or stay disciplined. Don't let egos stand in the way of a fresh start.\\nAries\\nMarch 21 – April 19\\nThe people that enter your life now could be here to stay. You might feel like you're standing on solid ground when you're speaking with them, as opposed to others who make you feel like you're lost at sea. Not everyone has the sensitivity needed to have an emotional discussion, but be aware that there may be a surprise suggestion or constructive criticism that you weren't expecting, even from trusted peers. Try not to take it personally, as it's likely coming from a good place.\\nTaurus\\nApril 20 – May 20\\nRoutines might provide you with the balance that you've potentially been looking for. Whether you're just starting out with a completely overhauled routine or you've been keeping one going for a bit of time by now, it's important to look back and analyze your efforts. What have you been doing right and where could you use more discipline? It's easy to slip into the mindlessness of your phone or the TV when you get home, so try not to let distraction tempt you.\\nGemini\\nMay 21 – June 20\\nFiery energy is arcing through the air! Regardless of your expectations for the day, someone might catch your eye or spark a great deal of passion in you. They may also be someone who inspires you for a specific creative activity, not just general enthusiasm. This could be a good time to invest in working on your hobby or practicing to make a creative career a realistic avenue for yourself. That said, make sure that you want this for yourself before you say yes.\\nCancer\\nJune 21 – July 22\\nThe world might have to come to you today. The case may be that you're stuck inside, or perhaps you simply don't feel like going out! Either way, the universe is reminding you of the benefits of hanging out at home. You might be inclined to avoid socializing altogether, even if doing so would benefit you. For this reason, it's important to at least consider getting out of your shell rather than hiding and waiting for things to blow over. Take charge!\\nLeo\\nJuly 23 – August 22\\nNew friends can boost your work on building the life that you want to have. You may already have the mindset that you need to succeed, but you might not yet have all the information or the support that you need, so stay open. Collaboration can be highly successful at the moment, but be aware that you could receive some criticism that you weren't expecting. No matter how constructive it's meant to be, it can cause you to obsess. Let it roll off your back.\\nVirgo\\nAugust 23 – September 22\\nYou might find that someone is working hard to be your rock. This person probably wants to express their care for you, but doing so may not come easily to them. They may struggle to express their feelings or what makes them feel secure. Once you are able to talk through some lighter things and establish healthy communication lines, they could feel safe enough to let their guard down and connect with you. Listen to them — you'll both be thankful you did.\\nLibra\\nSeptember 23 – October 22\\nThis day is about recognizing yourself and what is on your mind. It's important to express what you've been holding back and avoid attempting to conform to the status quo, because this could be dimming your natural light. It can be difficult for you to stay regimented and ensure that you focus on yourself. Still, know that you are worth it! If you don't highlight yourself, you may not have the awareness or energy you need to support others. Take care of yourself first.\\nScorpio\\nOctober 23 – November 21\\nPresently, internal balance will be more felt than seen. This could be rough if you normally rely on more tangible goals and ways of measuring your progress, but these may not have been supporting your ongoing emotions. You might be unintentionally letting these physical goals take over aspects of your life, without allowing for development of your spiritual or creative mind. Get in tune with your soul and start giving it the same level of importance that you give your brain.\\nSagittarius\\nNovember 22 – December 21\\nA recent community could offer you a chance to express yourself more fully than ever before. Previously, you may have struggled to find a place where you felt you truly belonged, but this group is capable of supporting your genuine needs, as well as providing you with feedback and support. Make sure that you are aware of the energy you're bringing to the group. Make a point of being open to the idea of working in tandem with others to find your success.\\nCapricorn\\nDecember 22 – January 19\\nAn opening to say what's on your mind in the workplace might be just around the corner. You could have strong feelings about a nonprofit that you've worked with, a job that you've been at for some time, or someone in your life that you want to experience more recognition. These desires could prompt you to speak up where you might not have normally. Honor your experience and opinions by letting them support you to speak up both for yourself and for others.\\nAquarius\\nJanuary 20 – February 18\\nYou might be stepping outside your comfort zone. Maybe you're no stranger to coming up with innovative ways of doing things, but your usual routine could need to adjust in a way that you haven't handled before. While that's exhilarating, it can also be daunting. Remind yourself of who you are and all that you've already conquered in your life! The more that you're able to stay disciplined in this endeavor, the more success that you should be able to gain later on.\\nPisces\\nFebruary 19 – March 20\\nLook out below! You're diving into a subject that interests you today. You might go down a rabbit hole of information that you had never seen before, and what you learn may be fascinating and something that you want to share with your family and friends. However, when sharing later on, others may make it obvious that they don't think it's as fascinating as you do. Do your best to avoid taking their lack of interest personally, as they'll likely come around in time.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Eddie Lacy, a former NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year, was arrested on suspicion of 'extreme DUI' in Scottsdale, Ariz. late Monday night, according to local police.\\nScottsdale cops responded to a report of a possibly impaired driver and observed a vehicle matching the description committing multiple traffic violations, according to Phoenix CBS affiliate KPHO.\\nThe driver, identified as Lacy, was pulled over around 10:40 p.m. local time and taken into custody, reported TMZ Sports. He was booked into Scottsdale City Jail, where he spent the night, and was released early Tuesday morning.\\nLacy has been charged with four separate counts of driving under the influence — DUI to the slightest degree, DUI with a blood alcohol content of 0.08 or more, extreme DUI with a BAC of 0.15 or more, and extreme DUI with a BAC of 0.20 or more. He's also been charged with possession of an open liquor container. His exact BAC is unknown.\\nNo other details surrounding his arrest or upcoming court appearances were made available.\\nAccording to the Arizona Department of Transportation, drivers found guilty of extreme DUI 'will be jailed for not less than 30 consecutive days with no eligibility for probation or suspended sentence and fined not less than $2,500' for a first offense.\\nLacy first gained nationwide attention starring at Alabama, winning three national championships and being named offensive MVP of the Orange Bowl. Following college, Lacy was drafted by the Green Bay Packers in the second round of the 2013 NFL draft.\\nIn his first season, he rushed for 1,1178 yards and 11 touchdowns. He was named a Pro Bowler and won the league's Offensive Rookie of the Year Award. He followed up with 1,139 and 9 scores in his second campaign.\\nHowever, his numbers declined in subsequent seasons as Lacy struggled with weight and injuries. The running back played his last NFL game with the Seattle Seahawks in December 2017.\",\n",

In the days since, pressure has mounted on him to step down or find a way to reassure New Yorkers that he can run the city while facing federal charges.\\nOn Wednesday, Gov. Hochul, who has the power to boot the mayor from office, acknowledged that she has privately directed him to make personnel changes, and called Pearson's resignation a 'good first step.'\\n'We expect changes. That's not a secret,' Hochul said at a Midtown press conference.\\nThe federal investigation is still ongoing, with prosecutors saying Wednesday they expect to charge more defendants in the Turkey case. In addition, there are separate federal corruption probes that have also ensnared several top aides.\\nAdams issued an executive order last week that allowed Wright's job to fall to another top aide if she was 'unable to perform her duties' — an unusual move that came just weeks after federal investigators seized her phones and raided her home as part of a sprawling probe that has thrown City Hall into chaos.\\nFabian Levy, a spokesman for the mayor, said last week the order was made to ensure 'continuity of government,' but denied that Wright was leaving the administration.\\nWright and Schools Chancellor David Banks got married on Martha's Vineyard last weekend in a small, private wedding.\\nHer exit also comes on the heels of several others over the past few weeks.\\nChancellor Banks, who shares a home with Wright and also had his phones seized by the feds last month, announced last week he's retiring at the end of the year — only for the mayor to this week move up his departure and order him to resign Oct. 16 instead.\\nA day before Banks' announcement, Health Commissioner Ashwin Vasan revealed he's stepping down, a move that came after both City Hall Chief Counsel Lisa Zornberg and Edward Caban, the NYPD commissioner, abruptly left the administration.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"One of my favorite childhood memories is the attention I got from my mom when I wasn't feeling well. She'd keep me home from school and feed me comfort food. This included her chicken soup and buttered toast, followed by preserved peaches. That fruit went down so smoothly that any ache was immediately soothed, and all but guaranteed a speedy recovery.\\nMemories of her canning efforts are etched on the front burner of my brain: her stern scooting of me and my older sister out of the kitchen so we weren't harmed by hot jars and sticky stuff. She stored the canned goods on a long, rough-hewn shelf in the basement next to assorted garden tools and seed-starting containers. I still dream about the perfectly aligned, incandescent jars of canned peaches, tomatoes, pickles and, in some years, sweet cherries from the Flathead Valley in northwest Montana. — Betty Cahill\\nA preserving primer\\nPreserving home-grown food never goes out of style. There's 'renewed interest in preserving since so many people took up gardening in 2020,' according to Laura Griffin, county extension specialist for Colorado State University in Pueblo. Plus, with the closeness of grocery stores, farmers markets and seasonal farm stands, you don't have to travel far to find home-grown produce to preserve without the effort of growing it yourself. The hardest decision to make is what vegetable and fruit you wish to preserve and the best method within your time and budget to preserve them.\\nGriffin's advice is to 'follow tested recipes explicitly for the highest quality and safe outcome.' (Check out CSU's website Preserve Smart for methods to preserve many kinds of food.)\\nAnother great resource is Ball Corp., a longtime go-to for food preservation information. Staffers there recommend using Ball's canning books published in 2016 and beyond for the newest and latest safety and home-preservation methods and recipes, or go online for up-to-date information.\\nThe best results in preserving come when fruits, herbs and vegetables are harvested at their peak. Toss or compost any that are damaged, bruised or over- or under-ripe. If the fruit or vegetable doesn't taste good after harvest, the flavor won't improve after the preservation process.\\nPreservation methods\\nBesides canning (water bath and pressure), common ways to preserve food include freezing, fermenting, drying, pickling and making them into jam or jelly.\\nFreezing vegetables is an easy preservation method. The general rule is to blanch them first, which means to immerse washed vegetables briefly in boiling water. Blanching helps prevent loss of color, texture and flavor. Times vary per vegetable. Once blanched, plunge them into cold water to immediately stop the blanching process, drain and place in labeled freezer bags.\\nVegetables that can be blanched and frozen include beans (green, snap, wax, lima, butter, pinto), cauliflower, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, peas, carrots, kohlrabi, rhubarb, summer squash, sweet corn, tomatoes and peppers. Be sure to fully cook beets, pumpkins, winter squash and sweet potatoes before freezing.\\nWhen I don't have time to use the water bath canning method for my home-grown tomatoes, I blanch and freeze them in heavy-duty, gallon-sized plastic bags.\\nFor fresh fruits: Wash, stem, dry and freeze on cookie sheets first, then store in freezer bags. Try blueberries, blackberries, huckleberries, elderberries, gooseberries, strawberries, raspberries, currants and rhubarb.\\nDrying or dehydrating removes moisture from food so bacteria, yeast and mold won't grow. Food dehydration equipment and ovens are most often used. The short list of foods that dry well include apples, peaches, pears, tomatoes, grapes, plums and herbs.\\nFermentation is where fruits or vegetables are cured in salt or brine for a week or longer to help the food produce lactic acid, which preserves the food and serves as a probiotic.\\nCanning. Water bath canners are made of either aluminum or porcelain-covered steel and are used directly on stove-top burners. The newest canners on the market are free-standing, electric stainless steel with built-in heat sensors. Either works well, so choose which canner suits you.\\nThe preserving process of water-bath canning is to force air out of the jar and create an environment to keep out microorganisms that cause food spoilage. It is recommended for high-acid foods including tomatoes, pickles, sauerkraut, peaches, pears, apricots, plums, lemons, gooseberries and blackberries.\\nNew canning research indicates some foods are less acidic so additional acidic ingredients should be added (lemon juice or white vinegar; see individual recipes). Laura Griffin points out that 'white-flesh peaches, because of their lower acid level compared to yellow-flesh peaches, should be frozen for safe preservation instead of water bath canned.'\\nPressure canning uses a heavy metal kettle with a lockable lid. The canners are used to process low-acid foods to destroy harmful bacterial spores that are present. Low-acid foods include okra, carrots, beets, turnips, green beans, asparagus, lima beans, peas, corn, meat and fish. Weighted gauge and dial gauge pressure canners are the only pressure canning equipment recommended by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Dial gauge pressure canners need to be tested for accuracy every year.\\nPickling. Home canning to make pickled foods has been a traditional way to preserve food for thousands of years. Pickling is a broad term for many types of fruits, vegetables and meat that are preserved by immersing them in a solution made of water, vinegar, salt and spices. This pickling brine solution creates an acidic environment that prevents the growth of bacteria, which makes the food stay fresh and tasty for a longer time. Commonly pickled foods include cucumbers, peppers, green beans, onions, eggs, okra and radish. Watermelon, peaches, nectarines, chutneys and relishes can also be pickled.\\nPickling cucumbers using a hot-water canner is good to try when preserving for the first time. My nephew Joe, who lives in Montana, was interested in pickling his own cucumbers after trying his grandmother's pickles. 'Nothing compares to home-grown flavor, and it is not too complicated,' he said. Recipes for the brine can vary, but he always adds fresh dill, cloves, white onion and pepper corns. (See one recipe from Ball below.)\\nGrow your own pickling cucumbers, which have a thin skin so the brine is better absorbed. Or find a farm stand or farmer's market with pickling cukes, which should be refrigerated when purchased to keep them fresh until processed. Popular pickler varieties are Excelsior, Bush, Calypso and H-19 Little Leaf.\\n———————————————————————-\\nRECIPES\\nSavory Corn Pudding\\nIn the past, as I planned my Thanksgiving menu, I've often lamented not freezing any of that Olathe sweet corn from the summer for my favorite corn pudding recipe.\\nBut this year, I'm ready. Using the guidelines from 'Keeping the Harvest,' by Nancy Chioffi and Gretchen Mead (Storey Books), I shucked and blanched fresh Olathe corn ears for 11 minutes in boiling water, then cooled them immediately in cold water. After draining well, I cut the kernels from the ears, packed them into plastic bags, then labeled and froze them. Come on, November. — Barbara Ellis\\nServes 12. Source: Southern Living magazine.\\nIngredients\\n3 tablespoons all-purpose flour\\n2 tablespoons granulated sugar\\n2 teaspoons baking powder\\n2 teaspoons kosher salt\\n6 large eggs\\n2 cups heavy cream\\n1/2 cup salted butter, melted and cooled\\n2 tablespoons canola oil\\n6 cups fresh corn kernels (from 8 ears, see note)\\n1/2 cup chopped sweet onion\\n2 tablespoons (or less) fresh thyme, divided\\nDirections\\nPreheat oven to 350 degrees. Stir together flour, sugar, baking powder and salt in a small bowl until blended. Whisk together eggs, cream and melted butter in a medium bowl until blended.\\nHeat canola oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add corn and onion, and cook, stirring often, until onion is softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in 1 tablespoon thyme.\\nRemove from heat and let cool slightly, about 5 minutes. Stir flour mixture and corn mixture into egg mixture. Spoon into a 13-by-9 (3 quart) baking dish, and bake in preheated oven until set and golden brown, about 40 minutes or more.\\nLet stand 5 minutes before serving. Sprinkle with remaining 1 tablespoon (or less) thyme.\\nNote: You can use kernels that you froze from fresh ears during the summer, frozen shoepeg corn from the freezer aisle, or petite white canned corn (but use higher quality if that's the only option). This can be made ahead. Bake as directed, let cool, and then cover and chill up to two days. Reheat covered with foil.\\nHays House Peach Pie\\nThis is my go-to summer pie, one that my book club pals and friends clamor for each August, when peaches start to come in from Palisade. I've also made it in the winter, using peaches that I've canned. The color isn't as vibrant, but it's still amazing. (We've run this recipe before, but it's worth telling you about it again. It's that good.) Serve with fresh whipped cream or Cool Whip. — Barbara Ellis\\nIngredients\\nFor the crust:\\n1 cup flour\\n1/4 cup powdered sugar\\n1/2 cup butter, melted\\nFor the filling:\\n1 cup sugar\\n1/2 cup dry peach gelatin\\n1/4 cup cornstarch\\n1 cup liquid (peach juice plus water)\\n1 or 2 drops almond flavoring, if desired\\n7 or 8 peaches\\nDirections\\nMix dry ingredients together. Add melted butter.\\nPress into 9-inch pie plate and up sides, but not onto rim.\\nBake crust 15-17 minutes at 350 until toasty brown. Remove and cool.\\nPeel and slice the peaches.\\nIn a medium saucepan, mix sugar, gelatin and cornstarch. Add the liquid (peach juice and water). Boil 3-5 minutes.\\nMix the liquid with sliced peaches and put into pie shell. Chill.\\nTop with whipped cream.\\nKosher Dill Pickle Spears\\nWhen canning pickles, the whole process of sterilizing the jars, cleaning the two-piece caps, cutting the cucumbers, heating the pickle mix and water bath canner took less than two hours. Loading the cucumbers and the liquid into the jars took a few minutes more. Be sure to use a clean, damp paper towel to wipe off any liquid from the jar rim and threads before capping. Check the lids the next day for a good seal (the center of the lid won't flex at all). If they are not properly sealed, eat the pickles right away, and refrigerate spears not eaten and use within a few days. There are many brining spice mix recipes out there; my nephew Joe always uses fresh dill, cloves, white onion and peppercorns. — Betty Cahill\\nThis recipe is for 'a classic pickle with big flavor and plenty of crunch,' according to Ball. Source: Ball Mason Jars. Yield: about 4 pint jars.\\nIngredients\\n2½ pounds 3- to 4-inch pickling cucumbers\\n2½ cups water\\n2 cups white vinegar (5% acidity)\\n1/4 cup sugar\\n1/4 cup pickling salt\\nBall Pickle Crisp (available at most supermarkets and WalMart)\\n4 cloves garlic\\n4 small bay leaves\\n12 dill sprigs\\n2 teaspoons yellow mustard seeds\\n4 small hot peppers (optional)\\nDirections\\nPrepare boiling water canner. Heat jars in simmering water until ready to use, but do not boil. Wash lids in warm soapy water and set aside with bands.\\nWash cucumbers and hot peppers in cold water. Slice 1/16 of an inch off the blossom end of each cucumber; trim stem ends so cucumbers measure about 3 inches. Cut cucumbers into quarters lengthwise.\\nCombine water, vinegar, sugar and salt in a small stainless saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Lower heat to simmer.\\nPlace 1 garlic clove, 3 dill sprigs, ½ teaspoon mustard seed, 1 bay leaf, 1 red pepper, and Ball Pickle Crisp (if desired) into a hot jar. Pack cucumber spears into jar, leaving a ½ inch headspace. Trim any cucumbers that are too tall.\\nLadle hot brine into a hot jar leaving a ½ inch headspace. Remove air bubbles. Wipe jar rim. Center lid on jar and apply band, adjust to fingertip tight. Place jar in boiling-water canner. Repeat until all jars are filled.\\nWater must cover jars by 1 inch. Adjust heat to medium-high, cover canner, and bring water to a rolling boil. Process pint jars 15 minutes, adjusting for altitude. Turn off heat and remove cover. Let jars cool 5 minutes. Remove jars from canner; do not retighten bands if loose. Cool 12-24 hours. Check lids for seal, they should not flex when center is pressed.\\nTips: Pickling cucumbers are small, crisp, unwaxed, and needn't be peeled. Wide-mouth jars aren't essential for pickles, but they do make for easier packing.\\nBlackberry Pie\\nI've been growing blackberries for years. Even though the yield isn't what it used to be, I still manage to freeze a couple of quart bags of berries each summer to use in this pie (or for blackberry jam; see recipe at kraftheinz.com). I got this pie recipe from neighbor Joyce, who loved it so much that it became part of the cookbook compiled by her large Iowa family. You can use your own crust recipe, but this one from Betty Crocker is the bomb. — Barbara Ellis\\nIngredients\\nFor the crust:\\n2 2/3 cups flour\\n1 teaspoon salt\\n1 stick butter-flavored Crisco shortening\\n7-8 tablespoons cold water\\nFor the filling:\\n4 cups blackberries (frozen OK)\\n3/4 cups sugar\\n1/4 teaspoon cinnamon\\n3 tablespoons cornstarch (or more if thawed berries are too watery)\\n3 pats butter\\nVanilla or berry ice cream for serving (optional)\\nDirections\\nPreheat oven to 425.\\nDefrost 4 cups frozen berries in the microwave, 50% power for 4-6 minutes (adjust for your microwave).\\nIn a medium bowl, mix sugar, cinnamon and cornstarch. Add berries, partially frozen. Set aside.\\nMake the crust: Mix flour and salt, then cut in Crisco. Add cold water 2 tablespoons at a time. Roll out bottom crust into 9-inch pie plate. Add berries and top with pats of butter. Roll out top crust, cover and seal edges. Sprinkle with sugar and bake for 30 minutes. Cover crust with foil to prevent burning and bake for 10 more minutes.\\nGrape Jelly\\nConcord grape vines meander along the south side of my Congress Park home. LOTS of grape vines. Even after the squirrels have had their way with them, there are still enough berries left to make several batches of grape jelly.\\nI use a stovetop juice steamer to get the liquid out of those sweet little gems. Many grape jelly recipes call for adding water when using store-bought grape juice, but with fresh grapes it's not necessary. We're using the traditional water bath canning procedure here. (Be careful not to burn yourself with that scalding jelly.)\\nAfter it sets, store the jars in a cool place. Best if used within a year. Or fancy up a few of the little darlin's and put 'em in a cute basket. Voila! Christmas gifts for the neighbors. — Barbara Ellis\\nMakes about 8 half-pint jars. Source: Sure-Jell and food.com. (Find lots of recipes for fruit jams and jellies using Sure-Jell at kraftheinz.com.)\\nIngredients\\n5 cups grape juice (from about 3 1/2 pounds of ripe Concord grapes)\\n1 (1 3/4 ounce) box of Sure-Jell pectin\\n1/2 teaspoon butter or margarine\\n7 cups sugar, measured and set aside\\nDirections\\nMake the grape juice using clean washed grapes (pick out leaves and stems before juicing). If not using a juice steamer, slip skins from 3 1/2 pounds of grapes. Mix grape pulp and 1 cup cup water in saucepan. Bring to boil. Reduce heat to low; cover and simmer 5 minutes. Press through sieve to remove seeds.\\nIn large pan, bring 5 cups of grape juice, fruit pectin and butter or margarine (to reduce foaming) to a full rolling boil for 1 minute, stirring constantly.\\nStir in sugar all at once, and bring back to a full rolling boil for 1 minute, stirring constantly.\\nRemove from heat. Skim off foam with metal spoon.\\nLadle immediately into prepared jars, filling to within 1/4 inch of tops. Wipe jar rims and threads. Cover with two-piece lids. Screw bands tightly. Place jars on elevated rack in canner. Lower rack into canner. (Water must cover jars by 1 to 2 inches. Add boiling water, if necessary.) Cover; bring water to gentle boil. Process 10 minuites or longer. Remove jars and place upright on towel to cool completely.\\nAfter jars cool, check seals by pressing middles of lids with finger. (If lids spring back, lids are not sealed and refrigeration is necessary.)\\nLabel and store in a cool place for up to 18 months.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Country star Garth Brooks was accused of raping and sexually harassing a makeup artist in a lawsuit filed Thursday in California.\\nThe alleged victim, identified as Jane Roe in the lawsuit, claims Brooks raped her in a hotel room in Los Angeles in 2019.\\nAccording to the suit reviewed by the Daily News, Brooks and Roe flew to Los Angeles so he could record a Grammy tribute performance to Sam Moore. But curiously, Brooks and Roe were the only people on the private jet, the suit says.\\nWhen the two arrived at the hotel in L.A., Roe learned that Brooks had booked only one room for the two of them, according to the documents. In that room, Brooks physically overpowered Roe and raped her, at one point holding her upside down by her feet, the suit claims.\\n'With cold disregard for Ms. Roe, when Brooks was finished, it was business as usual,' the lawsuit reads. 'Roe worked quickly to style his hair and do his makeup for the event so he was on time.'\\nAdditionally, the suit claims Brooks would consistently harass Roe while she worked for him, describing his sexual fantasies with her and groping her breasts.\\nIn one instance, Brooks walked out of the shower naked, forced Roe to grab his penis and asked her to perform oral sex on him, according to the suit. Roe says she pulled away and rejected Brooks' request.\\nIn the suit, Roe says she continued working for Brooks because she needed the money. She first started working for Brooks' wife, fellow country star Trisha Yearwood, in 1999, and began working with Brooks in 2017, the lawsuit says.\\nLast month, Brooks filed a preemptive legal action in Mississippi under the name John Doe, seeking to stop Roe from suing him, CNN reported earlier Thursday. He claimed her impending lawsuit would unfairly tarnish his reputation with 'false allegations.'\\n'But our legal system is not in place to allow wealthy wrongdoers the ability to run work-arounds on sexual assault victims who attempt to hold perpetrators accountable,' Roe's lawsuit reads in reference to Brooks' failed attempt.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Three years after the fatal on-set shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins, Alec Baldwin's Western film 'Rust' will finally be making its world premiere, but without the actor in attendance.\\nThe movie is set to be shown late next month at the EnergaCAMERIMAGE Festival in Toruń, Poland, event organizers announced Thursday.\\nStar and producer Baldwin — who was holding the prop gun when it misfired, killing 42-year-old Hutchins and wounding director Joel Souza — is not expected to attend the event, a source told The Hollywood Reporter.\\nThe specialty festival, which highlights achievements in cinematography, said Thursday a panel discussion will be held following the screening to honor Hutchins' memory and 'remind the world of her legacy.'\\nSouza is scheduled to be a speaker alongside Bianca Cline, the cinematographer who stepped in to complete the film after a wrongful death lawsuit was settled by Baldwin and his co-producers.\\n'The filmmakers will discuss events surrounding the film, offering insight into continuing production after Halyna's death … [and how Cline] managed to remarkably replicate Halyna's style,' festival organizers said. 'Maintaining Hutchins' artistic vision, as tremendously challenging as it was for the entire crew, was really important to the filmmakers, hoping to fulfill their duty to complete her work.'\\nThe film's premiere will come roughly four months after Baldwin was cleared of involuntary manslaughter when his trial was dramatically dismissed in mid-July.\\nJust two days after opening arguments, Judge Mary Marlowe Sommer dismissed the case with prejudice based on the misconduct of police and prosecutors over withholding of evidence from Baldwin's defense. She said the case cannot be filed again.\\nFollowing the judge's ruling, Baldwin broke down in the courtroom, hugging his two attorneys and then his crying wife Hilaria. He could have faced up to 18 months behind bars if convicted.\\nHowever, 'Rust' armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed did not meet the same happy fate. On Monday, Judge Marlowe Sommer upheld her conviction for involuntary manslaughter, despite her attorneys arguing the same 'suppressed evidence' that got Baldwin's case tossed could have cleared her as well.\\nGutierrez-Reed is currently serving 18 months in prison after being convicted in March.\\nSet in 1880s Wyoming, 'Rust' stars Patrick Scott McDermott as a 13-year-old boy who's left to fend for himself and his younger brother following the deaths of their parents. He goes on the run with his long-estranged grandfather, played by Baldwin, who's sentenced to hang for the accidental killing of a local rancher.\\nOriginally Published: October 3, 2024 at 4:47 p.m.\",\n",

According to the arrest report, Green and a group of unnamed co-defendants arrived at a residence in Miami Gardens, where a friend of the victim lived, just before 2 a.m.\\nAfter asking for the victim by name, the group confronted her about drugs, money and a stolen gun, according to officials. The victim denied any involvement and closed the door.\\nThe group then returned with at least three other men and forced their way into the residence, police said, according to local station WPLG.\\nOne of the men, who was armed, accused the victim of stealing a gun from him. After asking the victim where the missing gun was, he became violent and hit her 'several times' in the face with both a gun and his fists.\\nHe then handed the gun to another man, who used it to continue the beating.\\nGreen also joined in, hitting the victim over the head with a bottle of Tequila, the Miami Herald reported.\\nThe victim was then 'dragged out of the home by her hair' and forced into a Ford F-150.\\nAccording to police, she directed the group to her father's home, falsely claiming he had the gun, in a desperate attempt to escape her attackers.\\nBut when the father denied any knowledge of the missing gun, the group got back in the car and drove the victim to the causeway that connects Midtown Miami and Miami Beach.\\nShortly after 3 a.m., they stopped on the highway and dragged the victim out of the car, then shot her three times and fled the scene. She managed to walk along the causeway looking for help, and a passerby eventually spotted her and called police at around 3:45 a.m.\\nThe victim was taken to Jackson Memorial Hospital's Ryder Trauma Center in critical condition, but remarkably survived.\\nTwo days after the incident, she told investigators she knew all of the alleged assailants, except for Green.\\nGreen, who denies being present for the shooting, was arrested Tuesday and faces charges of attempted murder, kidnapping and home invasion.\\nShe's being held at the Turner Guilford Knight Correctional Center and her bond has yet to be determined.\\nSeveral suspects remain at large, officials said.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Ex-Rep. Liz Cheney was poised Thursday to join Kamala Harris on the campaign trail in Wisconsin to rally support from anti-Trump Republicans.\\nThe joint campaign event spotlights the extraordinary alliance between the liberal Democratic presidential standard bearer and the scion of one of the nation's best-known conservative political families, all aimed at defeating former President Donald Trump.\\nHarris plans to note that Republicans like Cheney can count on her to uphold the Constitution and serve the country's best interests, even if they may not agree with her on every issue, campaign officials said.\\nThe Democratic standard-bearer will declare that a leader like Trump who has publicly vowed to terminate the Constitution should never be allowed to win back the White House.\\nCheney, the former lawmaker from Wyoming whose father Dick Cheney was vice president under George W. Bush, is appearing with Harris at a historic one-room schoolhouse in Ripon, Wisconsin, where the GOP was founded before the Civil War as an anti-slavery party.\\nWith Harris and Trump locked in a tight race, Wisconsin is one of seven battleground states that will likely determine the winner of the November election.\\nCheney was a GOP rising star before breaking with Trump over his role in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. She recently said she would vote for Harris in the November election, building on her earlier vow to do whatever it takes to keep Trump out of power.\\n'Because of the danger that Donald Trump poses … I will be voting for Kamala Harris,' said Cheney, whose father shockingly endorsed Harris last month because of Trump's efforts to overturn the election.\\n'In our nation's 248-year history, there has never been an individual who is a greater threat to our republic than Donald Trump,' Cheney said in a statement. 'He tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him. He can never be trusted with power again.'\\nLiz and Dick Cheney are among the many prominent Republicans, including former Rep. Adam Kinzinger, ex-Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan and almost all of Trump's former cabinet members, who have endorsed Harris.\\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence, who blames Trump for putting his life in danger by siccing a violent mob of supporters on him on Jan. 6, says he won't support either Harris or Trump.\\nThe joint appearance comes a day after Special Counsel Jack Smith filed bombshell new legal papers that further detail Trump's role in seeking to overturn his loss in the 2020 election.\\nAmong many damning new details, the filing says Trump shrugged off a concerned aide' s concern after finding out that Pence had to flee for his life from the pro-Trump mob baying for his head.\\n'So what?' Trump told the aide, according to the new filing.\\nEx-Trump White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson also announced she too would vote for Harris.\\nHutchinson, who delivered bombshell testimony about Trump's misdeeds and inaction on Jan. 6 to the congressional committee that investigated the attack on democracy, said Trump cannot be trusted.\\n'The character of our leaders really matters,' Hutchinson told MSNBC Wednesday. '[Trump] cannot be trusted to uphold our rule of law and they can't be trusted to enact responsible policy. That in and of itself is disqualifying.'\",\n",

'What we found is that we will need to expand beyond the boundaries of Penn to reach the 48 trains per hour trans Hudson capacity.'\\nThat 48 trains benchmark is the expected capacity of the Northeast Corridor line after the sweeping, $40 billion Gateway project is completed, removing bottlenecks across the New Jersey Meadowlands and building an additional tunnel under the Hudson River.\\nAmtrak's plans have long called for an expansion of Penn Station to the south in order to build additional platforms to accommodate the expected uptick in trains.\\nAs previously reported by the Daily News, those plans would likely involve the demolition of what is known as 'block 780' — the city block between W. 31st and W. 30th Sts., bounded by Seventh and Eighth Aves. — in order to create more platform space for New Jersey Transit commuter trains.\\nPenn Station serves three different railroads. Amtrak trains traversing the Northeast Corridor from Washington, D.C. to Boston enter the station via the North River Tunnel under the Hudson River, and continue on to the north through the East River Tunnel.\\nLong Island Rail Road trains come to the station via the East River Tunnel, before turning around to return to Long Island.\\nNJ Transit trains share the North River Tunnel with Amtrak. After dropping their final passengers off at Penn Station they continue through the East River tunnel to the Sunny Side Yard in Queens before turning around.\\nAdvocates have floated several alternative proposals to increase train capacity while leaving block 780 intact.\\nOne set of proposals involves the creation of a new set of platforms below the existing station — akin to the MTA's creation of Grand Central Madison below Grand Central Terminal.\\nThe other set of proposals, known as 'through-running,' would let NJ Transit trains — which already head into Queens to turn around — and LIRR trains continue on into one another's territories, minimizing dwell time and speeding up traffic through Penn.\\nWednesday's report claims neither is feasible.\\nThe ventilation requirements of an additional underground station would necessitate expanding the footprint of the station, albeit slightly, said Foster Nichols of WSP. Passenger access would also be a problem, he said, in terms of placing stairs and elevators through the already narrow platforms of existing Penn.\\nAnd building the extension would severely disrupt service into Penn during construction, he said.\\n'Huge chunks of the station would be out of service to get it built,' said Nichols.\\nThe report goes on to argue that through-running would require extensive investments in the wider network of tracks and rolling stock in order to ensure that each railroad's trains and infrastructure are compatible.\\n'We looked at two alternatives,' Messick said. 'We found they did not meet the project goals.'\\nMessick said the next step is to look beyond the footprint of Penn Station. 'We're going to expand our purview and look at acquiring property to expand capacity.'\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"The NYPD is pulling out all the stops to protect city residents as they face a perfect storm of anti-Semitic strife felt across the globe, Mayor Adams vowed Wednesday.\\n'This city is under watch,' Adams assured alongside NYPD interim Commissioner Thomas Donlon at NYPD headquarters under a row of gigantic video screens showing real-time feeds of sensitive locations throughout the city. 'Your city will protect you. No matter what is going on around the globe, here in New York City you will be safe.'\\nPolice will be out in droves over the next few days as they protect Jewish residents during the beginning of Rosh Hashanah, as well as prepare for any blowback from Tuesday's Iranian missile attack against Israel and Israel's ground invasion of Lebanon.\\nCops are also preparing for this coming Monday, when Adams said a 'significant' number of protests are being planned to mark the first anniversary of Hamas' bloody attack on Israel.\\n'It will mark one of the worst terror attacks against the Jewish people since the Holocaust,' Adams said.\\nMore than 4,000 protests over the Israel-Hamas conflict have occurred across the city since Oct. 7, police said. While the city will defend everyone's right to protest, the NYPD will not tolerate any violence or disruptions, the likes of which have happened at some past protests, Adams warned.\\n'There will be a zero tolerance for those who violate the law, impede traffic and damage property while doing so,' Adams said. 'People will not be threatened.'\\nAlthough he is currently under federal indictment for allegedly receiving bribes, Adams said he expects his federal partners will come through for the city.\\n'This organization is a professional one,' Adams said. 'No matter what happens in this city at any particular time to any individuals, the operation continues.'\\nBesides an influx of police officers — both in uniform and in plainclothes — and heavy-weapons teams, cops will be adding additional cameras at key locations and activate 21 recently graduated K-9 dogs, who will be 'checking sensitive locations each day,' NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence and Counterterrorism Rebecca Weiner said.\\nThere have been no specific threats against New York City so far in light to the Oct. 7 anniversary, according to police. But last month a 20-year-old man was stopped at the Canadian border and accused of planning to carry out a mass shooting at a Brooklyn Jewish Center.\\n'One of our biggest fears is the lone wolf,' Adams said, encouraging New Yorkers who see something suspicious or out of the ordinary in the next few days to call police.\\nAnti-Semitic hate crimes have jumped by 75% so far this year, from 157 this time last year to 275, NYPD Chief of Detectives Joseph Kenny said. The lion's share of the crimes have been nonviolent graffiti or 'swastika motivated' attacks, said Kenny, who said he has added detectives to the department's Hate Crimes Task Force to investigate the additional incidents.\\nWeiner described the last year as 'incredibly challenging' as police continue to brace against ripples of hatred sparked by Oct. 7.\\n'Blood has been shed all over the [Mideast] region and the already heightened pressures we have been talking about over the last year [have] ratcheted up even further,' Weiner said. 'At a time of violence and turmoil around the world, we are here to assure you that New York City is an extremely safe place for all. We have kept this city safe and will continue to do so.'\\nOver the next few weeks, city residents are expected to see more heavily armed 'Hercules' teams of the NYPD Emergency Service Unit and uniformed officers in marked police vehicles at Jewish institutions, synagogues, foreign consulates and public places, like Times Square and Central Park, NYPD officials said. The visible surge in police patrols in the city is intended to be an added protection, as well as a deterrent to anyone thinking of committing a bias crime during these turbulent times, police said.\\nAt the same time, the NYPD Intelligence Bureau is also in constant contact with its overseas liaisons, getting real-time information on the conflict in the Middle East, as well as reviewing chatter on social media, to see if any possible attacks are being coordinated here, officials said.\\nOriginally Published: October 2, 2024 at 4:42 p.m.\",\n",

Federal investigators had recommended 17-22 years.\\nBut the 4th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals was unmoved. The judges said Murdaugh had signed away his appeal rights when pleading guilty, and the 40-year sentence was not an extraordinary circumstance that would let him out of that agreement.\\nMurdaugh's defense team referenced the high-profile cases of Sam Bankman-Fried, who got 25 years behind bars, and Elizabeth Holmes, who got 11 years. Those two fraudsters stole billions, while Murdaugh only admitted to stealing around $10 million.\\nBut Judge Gergel said he imposed his harsh sentence because Murdaugh stole from 'the most needy, vulnerable people,' such as a state trooper injured on the job and a trust fund set up for orphaned children. Bankman-Fried and Holmes, meanwhile, stole from wealthy investors.\\n'They placed all their problems and all their hopes on Mr. Murdaugh, and it is from those people he abused and stole,' Gergel said when he brought the hammer down.\\nMurdaugh has also been sentenced to two life terms for killing his wife, Maggie, and older son, Paul, at the family estate in South Carolina in June 2021. He has appealed the verdict in that case, arguing that a court clerk unfairly biased the jury against him. Earlier this year, South Carolina's top court agreed to hear his appeal on those grounds.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Empanadas seem to reign supreme among Latin American pastry, but if you're sleeping on Salvadorian pupusas, let this serve as your wakeup call. Skip the Avianca flight to San Salvador, and get your fix at Ricas Pupusas & Mas in Sunnyside, Queens.\\nOpened in September 2019 by Irma Vargas and her daughters, Abby and Amy Vargas, Ricas Pupusas & Mas is about as authentic as it gets. The recipes are passed down through the family of Irma's mother, who hails from Cojutepeque, El Salvador, with a few tweaks from mom along the way.\\nPupusas date back over 2,000 years, with origins tied to the Pipil tribe. While they are a staple in Salvadoran cuisine, they still fly far under the radar in the U.S. market.\\nBecause of this, the Vargas ladies — who started their cooking biz selling tamales for a church fundraiser in Jackson Heights on Roosevelt Ave — realized they wanted to highlight Salvadoran food.\\nPupusas are flat, almost like a stuffed pancake, and at Ricas Pupusas & Mas, you have the option of maiz (corn flour) or arroz (rice flour), Either way, the dough is freshly made each day. From there, you can choose from fillings including beans, cheese, chorizo and panes con pollo, a traditional Salvadoran dish made with bread, a whole chicken leg, and tomato sauce.\\nI ordered four pupusas: two made with corn and two made with rice flour. I got the corn pupusas filled with simply cheese, and pollo and queso, and the flour pupusas filled with chorizo and cheese and beans.\\nIt wasn't just pupusas, though. I was with a friend who got a hibiscus agua fresca, and I opted for the maracuya, or passionfruit. There's also a selection of Mexican offerings on the menu, as a nod to the Vargas' father, who hails from Guadalajara. You can choose from tamales, taco and burritos. The chicharron taco was strongly suggested so, twist my arm, I threw one of those in there for good measure.\\nThe pupusas came out shortly after I placed my order, and it was evident before I even dug in that they do not skimp on the cheese . Some had a crusted cheesy edge, signaling that I was about to be in for the cheese-pull of my dreams. There was a pickled cabbage slaw served on the side, which helped brighten the thick, dense treat.\\nThe cheese and chicken combination was my favorite, and was elevated even further when accompanied by a nice slathering of both the red and green salsa picantes offered on the side. The nicely spiced bite of the chorizo was up there in my rankings, as well.\\nWhile I was there strictly for pupusas, the chicharron taco on its own is enough reason to come back. The meat takes eight hours to cook and it shows; it's melt-in-your-mouth. Definitely throw some of the green sauce on there while you're at it. What can I say, I'm a fan of the green sauce.\\nThe Vargas ladies note the strong importance of community when running a biz in the dog-eat-dog world that is New York City. They still can be found on Roosevelt Ave every Saturday selling tamales and pupusas, and they credit Queens Together for helping them stay afloat during the pandemic.\\nAnd thank god they did. Ricas Pupusas & Mas continues to prove my theory that you can travel anywhere in the world without ever leaving New York City — but really, without ever leaving Queens.\\nYou don't need a 17-course, $500 Michelin-star meal to have a prime dining experience in New York. You just need four bucks and a MetroCard swipe.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Pink Floyd reportedly sold the rights to the band's likeness and recordings to Sony Music for $400 million.\\nThe deal came after numerous stops and starts amid decades of feuding between the band's frontmen, David Gilmour and Roger Waters, according to Variety. The psychedelic prog-rock group's catalog includes 'Comfortably Numb,' 'Another Brick in the Wall' and 'Money.'\\nPink Floyd's deal with Sony is said not to include published songwriting properties that remain under the control of the band members who penned the songs. That includes the estate of co-founder Roger 'Syd' Barrett, who wrote tunes including 'Lucifer Sam' before leaving the band in 1968, just three years after Pink Floyd began.\\nArtwork associated with Pink Floyd's often conceptual albums — including the rainbow passing through a triangular prism on 1973's ' The Dark Side of the Moon ' — is part of the package acquired by Sony Music. The British creative firm Hipgnosis is credited with creating much of that imagery. They also did record covers for Led Zeppelin, AC/DC and Wings.\\nSony nearly acquired Pink Floyd's music in 2002 for somewhere around $500 million, according to Variety. Quarreling between bandmates, largely tied to Waters' politics, reportedly complicated matters. Gilmour and other Waters' critics have accused the 81-year-old musician of antisemitism. Waters' refutes that characterization.\\nSony Music shelled out what's believed to be an unprecedented $1.6 billion for half of Michael Jackson's music catalog in February, according to the New York Times. Forbes reported in June that the music giant had struck a $1 billion deal to acquire Queen's music. Bruce Springsteen made the publication's list of billionaires in July, thanks in part to Sony shelling out $500 million for his song catalog in 2021.\\nEastman School of Music Professor John Covach told the Daily News in 2021 that there are a few reasons an artist might relinquish ownership of their music.\\n'If you're a young artist in your twenties, you might think, 'This is my retirement money, I have a revenue stream, I'm not going to sell my songs now,'' he said. 'It's different when you have more history behind you than future in front of you.'\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Warning: this article contains spoilers about 'Love Is Blind' season 7.\\n'Love Is Blind's' season 7's Nick Dorka has no regrets about anything he said in the pods, despite several of the ladies calling him out for being a 'smooth talker.'\\nThe former all-American college football player says this wouldn't be the first time he's caught flak for his self-proclaimed 'flirty' personality.\\n'I've heard that sometimes I'm a smooth talker. But honestly, it's really easy just to talk to someone and create conversation and chop it up,' he told Daily News. 'And sometimes it may come across as a little flirty.'\\nThe 29-year-old real estate agent connected with Hannah Jiles in the pods, who initially expressed her reluctance to choose him due to his words sounding too 'perfect.'\\n'I have a lot of concerns with you. Why are you here? Like, why did you want to do this,' Hannah asked Nick in the pods. 'You say all the right things, like you're great, you're perfect. I don't know what it is. Everytime I ask you a question, you articulate it great.'\\nView this post on Instagram\\nA post shared by Love Is Blind (@loveisblindnetflix)\\nHannah continued: 'I don't know what is. There's this gut feeling, I can't figure it out and I just don't like it.'\\nDespite that 'gut feeling,' the medical sales professional eventually came around and accepted his proposal when another connection didn't work out.\\n'You're confident. You've got it together, like you're this athlete, football guy, like I just saw a picture of this superficial person. And then the more we spoke and got deep,' she told Nick during the third episode. 'You're just so much more than what people think of you.'\\nAlthough Nick responded to all this criticism in the pods by assuring Hannah that he was committed to being loyal to her, Nick also says he's not ashamed of anything he did or said throughout the experiment.\\n'It played out exactly how it was supposed to. I feel like I was myself and I had some fun with it. No regrets.'\\nOriginally Published: October 2, 2024 at 12:02 p.m.\",\n",

       "   'excerpt': \"Stephon Gilmore's interception on the nine-yard line helped the Vikings defeat the Jets, 23-17, at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London.\",\n",
       "   'summary': \"Just like last week against the Broncos, the Jets had another chance to win the game late in the fourth quarter.\\nAnd just like last week, Gang Green's comeback attempt fell short.\\nCornerback Stephon Gilmore's interception on the nine-yard line helped the Vikings (5-0) defeat the Jets (2-3), 23-17, at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium in London.\\nThe Jets trailed, 17-0, early in the game, but down 23-17 with 3:07 remaining, they had one final chance to win the game. Aaron Rodgers and Garrett Wilson finally found chemistry after weeks of miscues and overthrown passes. The two hooked up on a couple of plays, which helped move the Jets' offense into Vikings' territory.\\nBut on a 3rd and 10 play on the Vikings' 26, Rodgers threw his third interception of the game, this time to Gilmore, which ended the game.\\nMinnesota improved to 5-0 for the first time since 2016.\\n'Credit Minnesota, they do a lot of different things,' Jets head coach Robert Saleh said. 'The interception that was returned for a touchdown made it a lot worse.\\n'Felt like, from that point on, our offense got our feet underneath it and started moving the ball pretty well. But putting ourselves in that hole wasn't good enough.'\\nMuch like last week's loss to the Broncos, the offense struggled for most of the day and only recorded one touchdown in the first half. Gang Green scored 10 points in the second half.\\nRodgers completed 29-of-54 passes for 244 yards, two touchdowns, and three interceptions. After the game, Rodgers told reporters, he has a low ankle sprain after he got caught up in a pile of Vikings defenders.\\n'Playing below our potential, too many mistakes,' Rodgers said. 'I think until now, we only had two turnovers, which is good because you give yourself a chance.\\n'But we are slow starters, too many mental errors and too many mistakes and that's hard to overcome. For me, I gotta take care of the football. You can't turn the ball over three times and win in this league.'\\nGang Green's rushing attack was nonexistent after rushing for just 36 yards. Wilson led all Jets receivers with 13 catches for 101 yards and a touchdown.\\nThe Jets' defense contained an explosive Vikings defense, which came into the Week 5 matchup averaging 25.2 points per game. Minnesota quarterback and ex-Jet Sam Darnold finished 14-for-31 with 179 yards and an interception, while the Vikings finished with 253 total yards.\\nAfter running back Aaron Jones left the game with a hip injury, the Vikings had trouble moving the ball on the ground after finishing with just 82 rushing yards.\\n'I thought our defense was outstanding today,' Saleh said. 'Thirteen points, they allowed 13 points and seven on the pick-6 and three off the field position. But overall, they battled, they kept answering the bell. A couple of plays, I think they want back regarding a couple of opportunities to get takeaways, especially in the pass game.\\n'But overall, it was a good game for the defense.'\\nThe first half was an unmitigated disaster for the Jets.\\nTheir offense suffered from drop passes, lack of a rushing attack, and turnovers, some of the same miscues that have plagued them for weeks. The Jets didn't register a first down until 10:50 remaining in the second quarter.\\nRodgers threw two interceptions and completed 10-of-20 passes for 95 yards in the first 30 minutes. However, the Jets were down 17-7 after Rodgers' late second-quarter touchdown to Allen Lazard.\\nIn the third quarter, Rodgers (60,148 yards) became the ninth player in NFL history to pass for 60,000 yards in a career. Tom Brady's 89,214 career yards are the most any player has thrown in league history. In addition to Brady, Rodgers joins a group of players that includes Drew Brees, Peyton Manning, Brett Favre, Ben Roethlisberger, Philip Rivers, Matt Ryan and Dan Marino.\\nAfter the Jets punted, Rodgers headed to the medical tent after he injured his left leg following a hit by Vikings linebacker Jihad Ward on a third-down pass play. Following a roughing the punter penalty on the Vikings, Rodgers jogged back out to the huddle and continued playing.\\nRodgers eventually helped the Jets offense down the field, which led to a Greg Zuerlein 32-yard field goal that trimmed the Vikings lead to 17-10 at the end of the third quarter.\\nEarly in the fourth quarter, Will Reichard's 53-yard field goal extended Minnesota's lead to 20-10.\\nStill down by 10 points on a 3rd and 15 play, Jets cornerback Brandin Echols, who came in for Sauce Gardner (head injury), intercepted Darnold's pass on the 42-yard-line, which allowed Gang Green to get within a score, and Rodgers responded. He found Wilson in the end zone for a one-yard touchdown that cut the Vikings lead to 20-17.\\nBut the Jets didn't score again following Reichard's third field goal of the day, this time from 41 yards that gave the Vikings an eventual 23-17 win.\\nThe Jets began the game with the ball. However, they went three and out and remain one of the six NFL teams not to score on any of their opening drives this season.\\nMinnesota got the ball following a Jets punt and had no trouble driving down the field. Two catches by Justin Jefferson help put the Vikings in field goal range. But Will McDonald's sack forced the Vikings to settle for a Reichard 54-yard field goal that gave them an early 3-0 lead.\\nJust when it looked like the Vikings were about to extend their lead further, Darnold fumbled a halfback toss to Ty Chandler, and Quincy Williams recovered the ball and returned it to the Vikings' 42-yard-line.\\nBut Gang Green couldn't generate points from Minnesota's mistake. Andrew Van Ginkel recorded his second pick-6 of the season after he intercepted Rodgers and returned it 63 yards for a touchdown. Van Ginkel read Rodgers' eyes on the quick slant before he broke a tackle and headed straight to the end zone, which gave Minnesota a 10-0 advantage.\\nRodgers returned on the next drive and immediately threw another interception, this time to Vikings safety Camryn Bynum. It was the first time during his 20-year career Rodgers had thrown two interceptions in the first quarter.\\nHowever, the Jets' defense kept the Vikings from scoring after the interception when they stopped them on fourth down on their 33-yard line.\\nIn the second quarter, the Vikings extended their lead to 17-0 after C.J. Ham's two-yard touchdown run.\\nGang Green's offense continued to stall in the quarter until Xavier Gipson's 30-yard punt return put the team on the 30 to begin the drive. Finally, after their seventh possession, Rodgers found wide receiver Lazard for a 14-yard touchdown that cut the lead to 17-7 before halftime.\\nMinnesota's offense received the ball at halftime but quickly went three and out. Akayleb Evans' fair catch interference penalty helped the Jets move the ball from the 25 to the 40-yard line. But that did not help the Jets' offense, as they again went three and out, and Rodgers became visibly frustrated.\\nLate in the third quarter, Zuerlein's 32-yard field goal put the Jets down, 17-10, and just one score from tying the game. Reichard's 53-yard field goal gave the Vikings a 20-10 lead in the fourth quarter. But Rodgers' one-yard touchdown pass to Wilson got the Jets within three points at 20-17.\\nReichard added a late field goal that gave Minnesota a 23-17 lead with 3:07 remaining. It was the final score as Gang Green failed on its comeback attempt.\\n'You're always going to find silver linings,' Saleh said. 'I'm not ready to talk about them now, but I do appreciate that our guys continue to battle, and they fought and gave ourselves a chance.\\n'We're right there with a chance to score a touchdown at the end of the game and go win it, and unfortunately, it didn't happen for us.'\\nGardner was evaluated for a concussion in the third quarter after his collision with Williams, but he returned to the game. Cornerback Michael Carter II did not following his hamstring injury in the first quarter. Linebacker C.J. Mosley (toe) was inactive for the third consecutive game.\\nNext week, the Jets will be in primetime on Monday Night Football, hosting the Bills. The Vikings will have a bye before hosting the Lions on Oct. 20.\\nOriginally Published: October 6, 2024 at 1:19 p.m.\",\n",

       "   'excerpt': \"The key to slowing down Sam Darnold and the Vikings' aerial attack may be stopping the run.\",\n",
       "   'summary': \"ELIMINATE PENALTIES\\nIn last week's loss vs. the Broncos, the Jets committed 13 penalties, including five false start infractions. Against a team like the Vikings, the Jets cannot afford to be undisciplined. Gang Green must be mistake-free and execute in all three phases of the game. Jets coach Robert Saleh says he isn't worried about Aaron Rodgers ' cadence system. Now, it's time to prove that. Penalties have been a problem for the Jets since Saleh became coach in 2021. Gang Green led the NFL in penalties in 2023 with 124. Entering Week 5, the Jets have committed 31 penalties, the eighth-most in the league.\\nPROTECT RODGERS\\nSpeaking of Rodgers, the Jets' offensive line needs to find a better way to protect him. Rodgers was sacked five times last week. The task will be challenging against a Vikings defense, one of the better units in the NFL. Minnesota leads the league in sacks (17) and is tied for fourth with three forced turnovers. The Vikings (40.8%) are also second in the league in blitz rate. Not only was pass blocking a problem with the Jets' offense but so was blocking on run plays. Gang Green registered just 63 yards against Denver.\\nSLOW DOWN VIKINGS GROUND GAME\\nThe key to slowing down Sam Darnold and the Vikings' aerial attack may be stopping the run. Minnesota RB Aaron Jones is averaging five yards per carry and has rushed for 321 yards in four games. The Vikings have outrushed all four of their opponents this season. It isn't just Jones, Ty Chandler has also rushed for 117 yards and 4.2 ypc. The Jets allow 128.5 rushing yards per game, the 20th-best in the league. If the Jets can stop the run, that will force Darnold to throw the ball more, which could lead to interception opportunities.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Garth Brooks' Tennessee mansion sold mere hours before he and his wife's former makeup artist accused the country star of rape and sexual harassment in a lawsuit filed on Thursday.\\nOne day earlier, the 62-year-old Grammy Award winner and his wife Trisha Yearwood sold their sprawling property in the Nashville suburb of Brentwood, which served as the set for more than 100 episodes of the latter's Food Network series, 'Trisha's Southern Kitchen,' Realtor.com reports.\\nThe couple, who have been married for nearly 19 years, initially listed the property for $4.5 million last year. They eventually lowered the asking price multiple times after failing to secure a buyer, ultimately selling the home for $3.34 million.\\nThe makeup artist, identified in the lawsuit as Jane Roe, accused Brooks of brutally raping her in a hotel room in 2019, when they were in Los Angeles to record his Grammy tribute to Sam Moore, according to the complaint reviewed by the Daily News.\\nRoe also described other allegations of assault and harassment, including multiple instances in which Brooks allegedly groped her breasts, forced her to grab his genitalia, asked her for oral sex and shared unwanted sexual fantasies.\\nRoe said she initially began working for fellow country star Yearwood back in 1999 and started working with Brooks in 2017. She continued to work for him for roughly two years after the abuse began, saying in the lawsuit that she only did so because she needed the money.\\nKnowing a lawsuit was coming, Brooks last month filed a preemptive legal action in Mississippi in attempt to stop her from suing him, according to Roe's complaint. He described the allegations as 'false' and accused her of attempted extortion, defamation and infliction of emotional distress.\\nIn the hours after Roe's suit was filed, Brooks issued a statement that read: 'For the last two months, I have been hassled to no end with threats, lies, and tragic tales of what my future would be if I did not write a check for many millions of dollars. It has been like having a loaded gun waved in my face.'\\nThat same night, Brooks performed a sold-out show at The Colosseum at Caesars as part of his Las Vegas residency scheduled through early next year.\\n'If there was ever a night that I really needed this, TONIGHT was that night!' Brooks subsequently wrote on Instagram, captioning a photo from the performance. 'Thank you for my life!!!!!'\",\n",

An argument ensued and the teens lunged at both men, sparking a fight.\\n'They both suffered some injuries but were able to fight off their attackers,' Paterson spokesman Sean Darcy said in a statement. The two men were around the block from their home when the attack took place, Darcy said.\\nThe group punched Paterson and his stepson about the head and body during the furious attack.\\nPaterson, who is legally blind, suffered bruises and some pain to his head, police said.

He served the remainder of the term, until the end of 2010, but did not seek re-election. Facing low-polling numbers at the time, the Obama administration reached out to Paterson and asked he not run for office.\\nIn 2019, he married Mary Sliwa, the ex-wife of Curtis Sliwa and co-founder of the Guardian Angels. Former Mayor David Dinkins officiated the ceremony.\\nCops early Saturday recovered surveillance images of the five teens involved in the fight and released their pictures to the media, hoping that someone recognizes them.\\nThe young woman is described as Black with purple braids.

In the days since, pressure has mounted on him to step down or find a way to reassure New Yorkers that he can run the city while facing federal charges.\\nOn Wednesday, Gov. Hochul, who has the power to boot the mayor from office, acknowledged that she has privately directed him to make personnel changes, and called Pearson's resignation a 'good first step.'\\n'We expect changes. That's not a secret,' Hochul said at a Midtown press conference.\\nOn Friday morning, Adams said he planned to speak with Hochul later in the day, but didn't provide further details.\\nThe federal investigation is still ongoing, with prosecutors saying Wednesday they expect to charge more defendants in the Turkey case. In addition, there are separate federal corruption probes that have also ensnared several top aides.\\nAdams issued an executive order last week that allowed Wright's job to fall to another top aide if she was 'unable to perform her duties' — an unusual move that came just weeks after federal investigators seized her phones and raided her home as part of a sprawling probe that has thrown City Hall into chaos.\\nFabian Levy, a spokesman for the mayor, said last week the order was made to ensure 'continuity of government,' but denied that Wright was leaving the administration.\\nWright and Schools Chancellor David Banks got married on Martha's Vineyard last weekend in a small, private wedding.\\nHer exit also comes on the heels of several others over the past few weeks.\\nChancellor Banks, who shares a home with Wright and also had his phones seized by the feds last month, announced last week he's retiring at the end of the year — only for the mayor this week to move up his departure and order him to resign Oct. 16 instead.\\nA day before Banks' announcement, Health Commissioner Ashwin Vasan revealed he's stepping down, a move that came after both City Hall Chief Counsel Lisa Zornberg and Edward Caban, the NYPD commissioner, abruptly left the administration.\\nBefore coming to the administration, Wright was the head of the nonprofit United Way of New York City. She also was president and chief executive of Abyssinian Development Corp., the economic development side of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem.\\nOriginally Published: October 4, 2024 at 5:47 p.m.\",\n",

He then drove her to a Walmart store, when she exited the vehicle and ran home.\\nLater that day, the victim contacted the Manchester Township Police Department to report she had been sexually assaulted.\\nAn investigation led by the prosecutor's special victims unit later revealed that Hahn — a registered sex offender — was the person who had raped the teen.\\nHahn was arrested Tuesday and charged with aggravated sexual assault, aggravated criminal sexual contact, kidnapping, endangering the welfare of a child and other offenses, Ocean County Prosecutor Bradley D.

       "   'excerpt': \"Juan Soto is set to hit free agency shortly after the Yankees' postseason run comes to an end.\",\n",
       "   'summary': \"When the Yankees first acquired Juan Soto from the Padres over the offseason, Brian Cashman said he understood that the slugger's time in pinstripes could be a 'short-term' situation.\\nHowever, the Yankees hoped that a year in pinstripes would convince Soto, an impending free agent, to stay beyond 2024. Cashman talked of the Bronx becoming the 'Mecca of baseball,' and he touted the Yankees' desire to win, among other factors, as a selling point for the 25-year-old superstar.\\nOn Saturday, Soto will begin his first – and possibly last – postseason with the Yankees when they host the Royals for the start of the ALDS. Lots of eyes will be on Soto, who won a World Series with the Nationals in 2019 and could fetch a $600 million deal this winter.\\n'I mean, I'm not thinking of the free agency part of it,' Boone said Friday of his expectations for Soto with a major payday waiting. 'I don't think he is. I think he's loving being here and being part of this team and knowing what's at stake and what he has an opportunity to do. He's been in playoff baseball before. He's won a championship before. He obviously knows what it takes.\\n'I don't think he ever gets ahead of himself like that. When that time comes, they'll handle that. But right now, I think he's completely focused on going out there and performing on a big stage in the playoffs.'\\nAsked if Boone's comment about 'loving' New York was accurate, Soto seemed to agree.\\n'I've been enjoying my time here. It's always great,' he said. 'It's always fun to be with a winning team with a winning group.'\\nSoto added that he's become accustomed to not worrying about his uncertain future, as trade rumors and contract negotiations hung over his last few seasons in D.C and San Diego.\\nWhen asked about hitting the open market this season, Soto has mostly said his focus is on playing and that his agent, Scott Boras, will handle contractual talks when the time comes. However, Soto brought his free agency up unprompted when the Yankees were in Seattle at the end of the season, and The Athletic's Brendan Kuty recently reported that the right fielder met with owner Hal Steinbrenner in July.\\n'Right now, we're focused on the playoffs,' Soto said. 'We're talking about trying to get another championship.'\\nFor what it's worth, Soto has appeared incredibly comfortable in the New York spotlight, frequently interacting with fans who demand the Yankees re-sign him via deafening chants.\\nHe's taken notice of the Bronx faithful. While Yankees fans surely won't make or break what Soto decides to do this offseason, he has noticed the love.\\n'It's really fun to be playing for those fans,' he said. 'They're in there day in, day out, every out, every inning. It's just incredible. It's really fun to play for those fans out here.'\\nSoto has also benefited from having Aaron Judge 's protection.\\nWith the presumed MVP hitting behind him all season, Soto is coming off one of the best seasons of his career. He slashed .288/.419/.569, finishing second in on-base percentage and third in OPS. He also hit a career-high 41 home runs while adding 109 RBI and a 180 wRC+.\\n'When you have the greatest hitter of all time hitting behind you, you're getting more pitches,' Soto said.\\nAdded Judge, who has also benefited from the tandem: 'Ooh, it's been a treat. Definitely been a treat, and excited to see what he does in the postseason.'\\nAs good as Soto has been on the field, Boone highlighted the presence he's been in the Yankees' clubhouse. Such talk dates back to spring training, but Boone reiterated the point on Friday.\\n'He obviously came in here with a ton of attention and all the attention that goes with him being a free agent at the end of the year, and you've never felt that,' Boone said. 'It's been about being part of this team, and he's fit in perfectly. It's been a lot of fun to get to know him and to see how much he cares about his craft.'\\nBoone also said that he's come to appreciate Soto's 'love of the game.' Asked why Boone thinks Soto has been 'loving' New York, the manager added, 'I just interact with him every day on some level.'\\n'To me, it seems like he's enjoyed his time here,' Boone continued. 'I'd probably enjoy my time, too, if I walked out with that skill set every day.'\\nNow the Yankees are hoping Soto's skills translate to the postseason.\\nHe's already a .261/.349/.495 playoff hitter with seven homers, 21 RBI and a ring that he keeps in a safe at home, but he's eager for a chance to pad all of those numbers this October.\\nSoto also can't wait to get a taste of playoff baseball in the Bronx — at least once.\\n'All the guys are talking about is how loud this place is going to be,' he said. 'That's what I'm looking forward to seeing and hearing: those fans going crazy.'\",\n",

The outlet said it had reviewed and obtained text messages from one of the women, in which she detailed her alleged relationship with 70-year-old Kennedy as he campaigned for president.\\nThe three women know Kennedy through the Children's Health Defense, the anti-vaccine group that he chairs and used as a springboard for his failed, long-shot presidential bid, as the Daily Beast also reported.\\nMediaite said that people close to the Kennedy family fear the new cheating allegations could jeopardize his standing in Donald Trump's campaign, as the former president and 2024 Republican nominee fights to win the support of suburban women.\\nIn a statement to Mediaite, a spokesperson for Kennedy denied that he's had any romantic relationships outside of his marriage to Hines. The 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' star is Kennedy's third wife and is reportedly considering divorce in the wake of his alleged sexting relationship with political journalist Nuzzi.\\n'This story is untrue,' the spokesperson said regarding the women's affair allegations. 'Mr. Kennedy has had no romantic relationships with any woman other than his wife since their marriage.'\\nBut Nuzzi and people close to her have told a different story.\\nNuzzi, 31, last month acknowledged that she had a 'personal' relationship with Kennedy while covering his campaign, after New York magazine announced that she had placed her on leave due to the relationship being 'in violation of the magazine's standards around conflicts of interest and disclosures.'\\nThe relationship allegedly began shortly after Nuzzi interviewed Kennedy for a New York magazine profile published in November 2023. While Nuzzi said the relationship never became 'physical,' subsequent reports said the romance consisted of an exchange of pornographic images.\\nWhile sources close to Kennedy have claimed Nuzzi was the one who pursued him, other reports have offered a different view. Mediaite specifically mentioned Kennedy's 'love bombing' tendencies, saying that's exactly what happened with the women he knew through the Children's Health Defense.\\n'I don't believe Nuzzi was the pursuer,' a source told Mediaite. 'This would be completely contradictory to Bobby's long-standing pattern of serial cheating.'\\n'There are a number of women in the 'health freedom' movement who thought of themselves as Bobby's only one, and I'm quite sure they are angry and shocked to find out they weren't,' the source continued. 'After talking to some of these women, I think what he does is just love bombs them. He makes them feel important, even tells them he loves them, and so they all feel special and wanted.'\\nIn addition to Kennedy reportedly jeopardizing his third marriage, his alleged philandering could wreck his political aspirations in a potential new Trump administration, according to Mediaite.\\nKennedy suspended his independent presidential campaign in August and endorsed Trump in the hopes of securing a role in a new Trump White House. He and Trump spoke about the possibility of him serving as Secretary of Health and Human Services, a powerful cabinet-level position, Mediaite said.\\nBut the scandal swirling around Kennedy over his relationship with Nuzzi is seen as 'an issue' for Trump's campaign and his top advisers and donors, particularly given the former reality TV star's own history of womanizing, a campaign source told the outlet.\\n'Trump is concerned (about Kennedy),' the source told Mediaite. He's 'concerned that there are more women, and that more affairs will come out. Right now, they are waiting to see if the news cycle will blow over, but it won't, which has Trump reconsidering Bobby's value.'\\nAny extramarital relationship could also doom Kennedy's ability to obtain a security clearance to serve in Trump's cabinet because affairs 'can be used as blackmail,' a top Republican political operative told Mediaite.\\nKennedy has long been dogged by allegations of infidelity. He acknowledged in a 2023 podcast interview that he's 'not a church boy' and he has 'many skeletons in my closet,' according to the Daily Beast.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"A Utah woman was arrested after unknowingly telling an informant she had fatally shot her estranged husband in the head in bed, then buried him in a shallow grave.\\nJennifer Gledhill, 41, was arrested Wednesday for investigation of murder and obstruction of justice, according to KSL-TV, but would not tell police where she'd hid the body. National guardsman Matthew Johnson, 51, has not been heard from since Sept. 20, did not show up at work three days later, and is presumed dead by authorities. Gledhill remained jailed Thursday without bond.\\nThe couple were in the middle of a contentious divorce and custody battle, according to court records — exiting a marriage that court commissioner Russell Minas said should have ended much sooner. Gledhill had obtained a temporary restraining order against Johnson, but Minas turned down her request for a permanent order one day before the shooting, citing their mutual dysfunction and finding that no abuse had occurred.\\n'The conduct of the parties over the past several months is representative of a highly dysfunctional marriage bringing out the worst in the parties — clearly suggestive that an action for divorce should have been filed long before reaching the current state of affairs,' Minas wrote in rejecting Gledhill's petition for a permanent restraining order.\\nAfter she allegedly shot Johnson, Gledhill bought a new mattress, cleaned up the scene and reported her husband missing. After the informant's report, investigators found a bloodstain on the carpet under the master bed and blood on the frame, along with evidence that ' significant cleanup had taken place after this crime had occurred, including bleaching walls, and using carpet cleaning supplies,' stated an affidavit obtained by Utah news outlet the Gephardt Daily.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"General Daily Insight for October 03, 2024\\nEmotions are running hot. The sensitive Moon squares fiery Mars at 3:00 am EDT, which can take us to a frustrating point, right on the edge of an emotional eruption. Later on, the Moon trines joyful Jupiter, putting a balm of good energy on the metaphorical burns from our earlier blazes of feelings. Finally, when the Moon faces off with wounded healer Chiron, we might feel almost wholly resistant to making amends with others or letting ourselves heal. We can be passionate without burning anyone.\\nAries\\nMarch 21 – April 19\\nTwo people that are close to you may not see eye to eye. The way that they communicate with each other might not be the way that you would communicate with either of them. Due to this mismatch, you could find yourself in the middle of their drama, trying to uncover any common ground. Ultimately, you're not responsible for helping them to find an agreement — it may not be something that's even possible for you to do. If so, let it go.\\nTaurus\\nApril 20 – May 20\\nIt's important to watch your words today. Because of a clash with someone in your life — possibly exacerbated by their treatment of you, intentional or otherwise — it could be difficult to hold your tongue the moment an argument begins. While they might be trying to drag you down to their level, you don't have to sink down there! In fact, it's vital that you don't allow them to pull you out of your character. Know yourself, and stand up for that self accordingly.\\nGemini\\nMay 21 – June 20\\nThe frustration of any current uncertainty increases the risk that you'll make an impulsive decision. You might want to jump into this situation rashly because you can't stand the lack of information you have about it, so you just want to get everything over with. However, this rush to get it finished might leave you with more problems than when you started! Keep in mind that a momentary decision could incite long-lasting consequences. Think things through instead of letting anger rule you.\\nCancer\\nJune 21 – July 22\\nYou might find yourself at odds with a family member. This person could be a relative or a close friend of yours. Either way, it's likely that they're older than you or have another social advantage. This could embolden them to be critical of you or push you in a direction that you dislike. The universe wants you to stand up for yourself, but there's no need to hurl hurtful insults, especially if they aren't relevant. You can be firm without being cruel.\\nLeo\\nJuly 23 – August 22\\nAn emotional build-up that you weren't aware of could explode without warning. You might not have realized that you were suppressing so much! Any little event could be the straw that breaks the camel's back, leading you to unleash the beast on the next person who adds to your stress. This volatile self-expression can be hurtful to others, so make an effort to channel this furious passion into other places. Exercising your mind or body (or both!) should be great catharsis. Tame that wildfire!\\nVirgo\\nAugust 23 – September 22\\nYou might find your present goals are slightly out of reach. Even when you give it your all, there could be obstacles that you can't yet overcome. It could be something that you wanted to finish quickly, but now you have to wait until things settle down. Whether it's because of procrastination, the actions of others, or just bad luck causing your goals to slip through your grasp, try not to be discouraged. There will be more time to find your way to success.\\nLibra\\nSeptember 23 – October 22\\nYou're taking the reins! You may be forced into a leadership position, one that demands you make decisions for other people. Being a stern boss may not be a position that you naturally enjoy taking. Delegation can be stressful to navigate, especially when the tasks are not enjoyable for the people that you're giving them to. You might want to make everyone happy, but sometimes the best you can do is be fair as you divide tasks and work with them.\\nScorpio\\nOctober 23 – November 21\\nInformation that you're about to learn may incense you. Perhaps your careful plans must be canceled, or maybe you have to do some tedious task that you weren't previously warned about. Regardless, it'll be tough to catch up or update your plans on the fly. Whenever your to-do list gets overwhelming, take it one step at a time and know that you only have to do your best. No one should be disappointed in your efforts to roll with the punches.\\nSagittarius\\nNovember 22 – December 21\\nYour dreams may feel stuck in a rut, unable to lift off. Every corner could seem like a dead end, whether an opportunity didn't pay off or a mistake hampered your progress. This can be discouraging and irritating at the same time, but it's important for you to get back on the metaphorical horse and start making new plans. Your ambitions shouldn't be shot down by one difficult day, so keep trying to find better ways to build them in reality.\\nCapricorn\\nDecember 22 – January 19\\nSomeone else's feelings may explode in a way that you weren't expecting. They could have been holding everything inside, trying to protect their image or others from their turmoil, but simply weren't able to stop themselves from boiling over. If this person simply confesses how they're struggling to you, that's fine, but you don't have to tolerate the brunt of an angrier outburst in silence. Once the way that they're seeking catharsis begins to affect you negatively, make sure to tell them.\\nAquarius\\nJanuary 20 – February 18\\nA hidden enemy may make themselves known at any moment. They could have been putting on a friendly act to prevent you from seeing their true colors, since once you see behind the curtain, there will potentially be no way for them to hide how they're truly feeling about you. Even if you want to make amends or suggest similarities that you can connect on, the other person is unlikely to be interested in that. Don't chase what isn't for you.\\nPisces\\nFebruary 19 – March 20\\nReckless actions made in the heat of the moment will have consequences. You may be feeling more impulsive, making it easier to succumb to the influence of others, procrastination, bad habits, or leaping to conclusions in general. You might not even realize how impulsive you are feeling until after you've already jumped in with both feet. Do your best to stay aware of how you're spending your time and how you're utilizing your patience. There's no need to rush yourself through the day!\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"MILWAUKEE — The theme of the year for the Mets has been finding ways to win. But to keep their season alive, they're going to have to find a way to limit rookie sensation Jackson Chourio, as well as hit a stifling Milwaukee Brewers' pitching staff to keep their season alive Thursday.\\nWith the Mets holding on to a 3-2 lead in Game 2 of the NL Wild Card series, right-hander Phil Maton gave up a game-tying home run to Chourio in the bottom of the eighth. Then, with two outs, the right-hander allowed a huge, two-run go-ahead shot to Garrett Mitchell.\\nThe Mets dropped the second game of the best-of-three series, 5-2, on Wednesday night at American Family Field. The winner of Game 3 will move on to face the Philadelphia Phillies in the NLDS.\\n'We've been knocked down and we have the ability to get back up,' said manager Carlos Mendoza. 'Here we are, got punched today. We'll get right back.'\\nChourio hit two game-tying home runs, with the first one coming in the bottom of the first against left-hander Sean Manaea after the Mets went up 1-0. At just 20 years old, he's considered one of the league's rising young stars. To the Mets this week, he's a home-run threat they have to contain.\\n'He's a young, talented hitter who can always fight off fastballs,' Maton said.\\nMaton thought the pitch selection was good, but he left the home run pitch over the plate. Chourio led off the eighth, with Maton throwing a curveball out of the zone for ball 1, and a sinker for strike 1. He threw a cutter that Chourio 398 feet to right-center field.\\n'It's extremely frustrating,' Maton said. 'I would have rather given that up in a regular season game. But looking over the iPad, looking at the pitches overall, I'm pretty happy with my pitch selection. Execution, there was a little bit too much plate with some of them, but I think it was one of those situations where they just beat me today…\\n'It's a little easier to rest on that, but ultimately, we have to take care of business tomorrow and respond.'\\nCloser Edwin Diaz was available for up to four outs if needed, but after William Contreras grounded into a double play, the Mets stuck with Maton. Ryne Stanek retired the Brewers in order in the seventh, but Mendoza didn't want to leave him in to face Chourio.\\nPrior to the eighth, neither team had given up much offense. When the Mets had chances, the Brewers made tough pitches, but they also failed to capitalize on the chances they did have, going 2-for-11 with runners in scoring position and leaving nine on base.\\nThe Mets scrapped for three runs over the first two innings against right-hander Frankie Montas. After going up 1-0 in the first using a force-out, an infield single and a shallow single, Pete Alonso came up to bat, but the slugger hit into a double play, tripping over the bat while coming out of the box.\\n'If I hadn't tripped over my bat, I would have legged it out and a run would have scored there,' Alonso said. 'It sucks to legitimately trip there and not get that run in.'\\nThe Mets took a 3-1 lead in the second, but stranded two.\\nThe entire game was too close for comfort. The Mets have been playing this way for weeks, with every pitch and every play carrying weight. And there were times when it was obvious that the Mets weren't exceptionally comfortable.\\nWith two on and none out in the top of the six and the Mets holding a one-run lead, Tyrone Taylor and Francisco Alvarez both swung at first-pitch sliders low in the zone from Joel Payamps. Both hit right into outs. After the Brewers intentionally walked Francisco Lindor, Jose Iglesias, one of the Mets' best hitters with runners in scoring position, struck out on four pitches to strand the bases loaded.\\n'I thought we had good at-bats, we just didn't get the final one,' Mendoza said. 'You're facing an elite pitching staff and they went to the bullpen again early. It's not going to be easy to score when you face a different arm and matchups.'\\nAfter the Chourio homer in the first, the Brewers were held scoreless until the bottom of the fifth, when Brice Turang scored on a sacrifice fly. Manaea exited with the lead, having given up two earned runs on six hits with four strikeouts over five innings.\\nThe lefty would have liked to pitch the six, but Mendoza went to right-hander Reed Garrett.\\n'I know the playoffs are a little bit different of a situation,' Manaea said. 'It's all Mendy's decision.'\\nGarrett and Stanek blanked the Brewers in the sixth and seventh, while Milwaukee used five relievers after pulling Montas in the fourth. Montas went just 3 2/3 innings, allowing three runs (one earned), walking one and striking out three.\\nDevin Williams, one of the NL's top closers, shut the door in the ninth to force a decisive Game 3 on Thursday.\\n'We just didn't get the last one today,' Mendoza said. 'But overall, I thought we had really good at-bats.'\\nOriginally Published: October 2, 2024 at 10:40 p.m.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"The city's Law Department is bankrolling legal fees for three city employees ensnared in criminal investigations — including Molly Schaeffer, Mayor Adams' asylum seeker operations director who was recently subpoenaed in a federal corruption probe, the Daily News has learned.\\nSchaeffer was served with the subpoena last week by federal investigators working for the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office. Sources have confirmed the subpoena is requiring Schaeffer to deliver grand jury testimony as part of an investigation looking into kickbacks on city contracts that has also ensnared multiple other top aides to the mayor, including Tim Pearson, a senior adviser who announced his resignation this week.\\nIn a letter to Councilwoman Gale Brewer on Tuesday, the city Law Department confirmed it's currently representing three city employees in connection with criminal matters. The letter, which was obtained by The News, did not name the three employees or the investigations they're facing but sources familiar with the matter confirmed one of them is Schaeffer and that she's receiving free legal representation in connection with the contracts probe.\\nThe letter specifies it's the Law Department's understanding that the three city employees it's providing free representation for 'are neither targets nor subjects of the investigations.' That means they aren't expected to face criminal repercussions and the Law Department referred to the trio in the letter as 'witnesses.'\\nThe identities of the other two city employees receiving free legal representation were not immediately clear but all three are being represented by Yankwitt LLP, a White Plains-based firm, with the Law Department picking up the cost, the letter says.\\nSchaeffer is specifically being represented by Benjamin Allee, a partner at the firm. He did not reply to a request for comment.\\nThe Law Department letter says partners representing the three city employees are being paid $600 per hour.\\nSchaeffer has played a leading role in overseeing billions of dollars in contracts with private companies to provide services like food, shelter, security and case management to thousands of migrants coming through New York City. She has worked closely with Pearson, a former NYPD inspector who was given sweeping powers by the mayor to award migrant contracts.\\nPearson's detailed daily schedules, obtained by The News via a Freedom of Information Law request, show he sat down with her four times in April 2023, her first month in her current job, for meetings labeled 'asylum seeker updates,' and met daily to discuss the migrant crisis starting in May 2023.\\nThe feds investigating Pearson, who has known the mayor for decades, seized his phones and raided his home last month. His attorney has denied Pearson engaged in any wrongdoing but he announced his resignation from the administration Monday after the mayor for months rebuffed demands to fire him.\",\n",

Detectives believe he was the last person to see the therapist alive.\\nIt's not clear whether the TikToker, known for online for his comedic skits, knew Abraham, and his potential motive was not provided.\\nThe charges stem from the killing of 69-year-old William Nicholas Abraham, whose body was found Sunday along Highway 51 between the unincorporated community of Fluker and the Village of Tangipahoa, some 60 miles outside of Baton Rogue. According to a press release from the Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff's Office, the remains were partially hidden in brush on the side of the road.\\nThe local coroner determined Abraham died as a result of blunt force trauma and ruled his death a homicide, police said. He was 'a life coach, licensed professional counselor, motivational speaker, recording artist, author, teacher and trailblazer' with more than 30 years experience treating substance abuse, per his website.\\nOn Monday, a Baton Rouge Police officer attempted to stop a black Lincoln MKZ on North Sherwood Forest Boulevard, according to the arrest affidavit. The driver, later identified as Thomas, ignored the officer's efforts to pull him over and backed into the police cruiser before fleeing the scene.\\nAuthorities later determined the vehicle involved was registered to Abraham.\\nIn 2015, Abraham was accused of molesting an 11-year-old, but the charges against him were ultimately dropped. The local district attorney's office confirmed to WBRZ that Thomas was not the alleged victim.\",\n",

The company added that the certificate didn't come from them.\\nThe footage shows an older man making his way up to the front of a room during the Ellis County WildGame Dinner to retrieve the guitar from a man sporting a cowboy hat and holding out a hammer. The buyer takes the hammer to the instrument as the crowd cheers him on, and then gleefully brings the guitar back to his seat.\\nAuction organizers previously told TMZ that the guitar was donated prior to Swift's recent endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris. The move was alluded to in many of the online responses, both those in favor of the pop star and her politics as well as those slamming Swift and singing the praises of Republican nominee, former President Donald Trump.\\n'That sounded much better than any of her music,' tweeted one user.\",\n",

Its fiery look is due to the fact that the moon will be at its farthest point from Earth, so it does not cover the sun entirely, creating a ring-shaped silhouette of sunlight.\\n'Because the Sun is never completely covered, observers must wear proper eye protection at all times during this eclipse,' experts at NASA warned.\\nA partial eclipse, meanwhile, will take over skies across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, including Hawaii, where it will be visible from 6:10 a.m. HST to 7:57 a.m. It can also be seen in other parts of South America, including Brazil, Uruguay and Mexico as well as Antarctica.\\nThe phenomenon comes a year after the last annular eclipse swept across much of the Western Hemisphere and some six months after a total solar eclipse wowed people across North America, from the Southwest to the Northeast. The rare event drew millions of spectators outside in the middle of the day, all of them eager to witness the first full solar eclipse in seven years.\\nThe next total solar eclipse that can be seen in United States will be on Aug. 23, 2044.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"BUCS at FALCONS\\n8:15 p.m., Falcons by 2 ½, 43 ½\\nHANK'S HONEYS: Kirk Cousins, as always, is a gamer, but his still-not-100% Achilles has made him a marked man. He doesn't have the same mobility and he's been near the bottom of the league in QB efficiency when under pressure, with three picks and four sacks in his two games against the strong pass rushes of the Steelers and Chiefs. Everything in Todd Bowles' defense works off the blitz. Injuries have hit the Bucs' defense, but those injuries didn't show up against the Eagles last week, when they sacked Jalen Hurts six times. They have impressively allowed just 19.5 ppg, including matchups against the Lions and Commanders.\\nAfter blowing a tire the previous week against the Broncos, Baker Mayfield and the Bucs offense got back on track with 445 yards of total offense. Mayfield is patient and can spread the ball around and that's what you need to do against this defense. Betting trends also favor the Bucs. They have covered in eight of their last 11 games while the Falcons are just 2-10 ATS in their last 12 games as favorites. Thursday night games are generally low scoring and with Atlanta likely to lean on the run (Tampa Bay is 22nd in rushing yards allowed), the under is very much in play. The Falcons have been settling for Younghoe Koo field goals a lot (34 of the Falcons' 73 points have come off his toe), and the Bucs have allowed just one TD through the air all season long. Additionally, the Falcons' defense is based on limiting big plays. They make you grind out drives.\",\n",

The Campaign Finance Board noticed something fishy and denied the matching funds.\\nOn Wednesday, King pleaded not guilty to a 'criminal information' finding after waiving an indictment. That typically signals a defendant's willingness to plead guilty on the spot, though Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric Silverberg said at the hearing that plea negotiations would likely continue for 30 to 60 days.\\nKing used money-transfer apps like Cash App to send money to the supposed donors, then asked them, in turn, to make $175 donations to the campaign, the feds allege.\\nThe feds laid out several of these transactions in a court filing Wednesday. On May 11, 2021, she sent one person $1,100 and a second person $540, telling that second person in a message, 'Contribute … for me 175×3 ppl 180 each,' according to the feds.\\nShe paid another would-be contributor $1,700 on June 26, 2021, the feds allege. Three days later, that contributor wrote in an Instagram message to yet another prospective donor, 'I need to contribute to this guy's election but since [I] don't live in [Brooklyn] I can't directly contribute. So I'm giving my [Brooklyn] friend the money to donate for me. If [I] can give you 175 to donate to his campaign that would help me out a lot[.]'\\nKing, who was released on her own recognizance, returns to court Oct. 30. She declined comment Wednesday.\\nHer lawyer John Wallenstein called the allegations 'old news' from the 2021 Brooklyn borough president campaign, but declined to comment further.\\nJones came in eighth in a field of 12 primary candidates, getting just 3% of the vote and losing to Antonio Reynoso, who won the general election that November.

       "   'summary': \"PHILADELPHIA — Two Philadelphia Phillies fans walked around the Citizens Bank Park concourse on Saturday afternoon asking fans decked in red and powder blue, if they were ready to 'smash the pumpkin.' Clearly, the 'playoff pumpkin' displayed by Pete Alonso after the Mets ' Wild Card win is not welcome in enemy territory.\\nThe pumpkin remains intact after a 6-2 win in Game 1 of the NLDS. The Mets scored five runs in the top of the eighth off three Philadelphia relievers to win in comeback fashion for the third time in four playoff games.\\nThe city of Philadelphia seems to be under the impression that the Mets advanced to the NLDS by sheer vibes alone. To be fair, the Mets did have a menagerie of mascots this season and their second baseman is a Latin pop star, so yeah, the vibes are high, but the same was said about the Phillies during their run to the World Series two years ago.\\nKodai Senga made his anticipated return and promptly gave up a 425-foot bomb to Kyle Schwarber in the bottom of the first. But Senga, David Peterson, Reed Garrett, Phil Maton and Ryne Stanek combined to hold the Phillies scoreless nearly the rest of the way through. They limited the NL East champs to two runs on five hits, with Stanek giving up a run in the top of the ninth.\\nZack Wheeler, a former Mets starter, was brilliant, shutting the Mets out over seven innings, allowing only one hit, while walking three and striking out nine. The Mets swung and missed 30 times on Wheeler's offerings, an absurd number.\\nIt became a different ballgame after Wheeler's exit.\\nThe Mets scored twice against right-hander Jeff Hoffman in the top of the eighth before an out was recorded. The right-hander gave up a single to No. 9 hitter Francisco Alvarez and walked Francisco Lindor to bring up Mark Vientos, the only player in a Mets uniform to get a hit off Wheeler. Vientos hit Hoffman too, sending a single to left field to score Harrison Bader, who pinch-ran for Alvarez.\\nThe Phillies went to the bullpen for left-hander Matt Strahm to counter the left-handed hitting Brandon Nimmo, but Nimmo lined one to shallow left field to score the go-ahead run. A fly ball by Pete Alonso scored Vientos to give the Mets a 3-1 lead, and Jose Iglesias (the aforementioned Latin pop star) then worked a 10-pitch at-bat, sending a cutter up the middle for an RBI single, chasing Strahm from the game.\\nRight-hander Orion Kerkering then came in and the Mets countered with J.D. Martinez. With two on and one out, the veteran singled up the center to score Nimmo and Iglesias beat the tag to third, putting him in position to score on a fly ball to center field by Starling Marte.\\nSenga threw two pitches to Schwarber before the leadoff man hit the third into the second deck of right field. In his first start since late July, few knew what to expect from the enigmatic right-hander.\\nHe threw 31 pitches over two innings, striking out three and walking one. Peterson, who earned the save Wednesday night in Milwaukee, followed up with three no-hit innings, walked three and struck out one.\\nThe Mets played the matchups from there, using Reed Garrett for two innings and Phil Maton after they took the lead. A sixth run in the top of the ninth allowed them to save Edwin Diaz, who threw 39 pitches two days ago.\\nIn the end, the only smashing was done to the Phillies bullpen.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"General Daily Insight for October 06, 2024\\nMaking decisions might be more of a challenge at present. Intellectual Mercury squares passionate Mars at 2:37 am EDT, setting off an internal war between logic and instinct. We must strike a balance to move forward. The emotional Moon then faces off against unpredictable Uranus, inviting surprises that can hit all of our nerves if we're not grounded. Later, the confident Sun struggles to understand serious Saturn, creating more conflicting desires for solitude versus spending time with others. Search for a happy medium.\\nAries\\nMarch 21 – April 19\\nOne of your peers might inspire you to step out of your current comfort zone. You could be shocked by the way that they (purposefully or accidentally) entice you toward a new way of life, a different career, or even a unique way of expressing yourself. This fresh perspective will probably be difficult to process in one day, so be patient with yourself. It's okay to let yourself unravel things slowly rather than convincing yourself that you must understand it right away. Baby steps!\\nTaurus\\nApril 20 – May 20\\nWhat you say you want and what you've actually been consistently doing may be working against each other. Bad habits could be snapping at your ankles or weighing down your steps, distracting you from the necessary everyday tasks your ultimate goal requires. Sitting around hoping that something useful will happen can almost guarantee that your ambitions will remain pipe dreams, while allowing yourself to be distracted by habits will also waste your energy and slow your progress. Find the right pace.\\nGemini\\nMay 21 – June 20\\nYou might struggle to get your feelings across to others today. There could be something in the back of your mind that is preoccupying your thoughts, and the people around you may not be aware of this. Your desire to express how you're feeling might be at war with your desire to work through your problems on your own to avoid embarrassment — this can lead you to not work through them at all. Don't let your inner conflict leave you with choice paralysis!\\nCancer\\nJune 21 – July 22\\nControlling your impulses could be tough in this moment. There may be a choice presented to you that encourages you to jump into action without hesitation, but waiting to make this choice might genuinely be the better option. Just because someone else is pushing you to make this decision doesn't mean that you have to follow their lead! Odds are, they may want something from you. Don't let your impulsiveness overpower that small voice inside you, because your intuition knows the way.\\nLeo\\nJuly 23 – August 22\\nYou're combining the best parts of logical reasoning and heartfelt emotion. You're motivated to figure out the best way to consistently incorporate both creativity and logic into your day-to-day life. Maybe you're asking your boss how you can make your work more fun and encouraging while keeping it informative and beneficial to the company. On the other hand, perhaps you're trying to make your home more beautiful as well as more functional. Let a little bit of both worlds influence your decision-making process.\\nVirgo\\nAugust 23 – September 22\\nYour heart may want you to go out, against your mind's argument for staying in. A friend group or your family could be trying to spend time with you, which you might want, but that might set you back in terms of achieving your goals by interrupting your plans for the day. Try to strike a balance, maybe by going out for a while, but coming back early to finish up your work. All work and no play is no good — and vice versa.\\nLibra\\nSeptember 23 – October 22\\nThe responsibilities that you set up for yourself could be dragging you down at the moment. You may want to live your best individual life, or there could be sudden plans that you want to join in on, but you've already promised to assist someone else or to work on other things. Instead of shirking your responsibilities, make an effort to fulfill them before running off to stir up some fun. The more dependable you are today, the more it should benefit you later.\\nScorpio\\nOctober 23 – November 21\\nWhen did you last listen to your heart? Other people may let you down today — perhaps a peer shocks with you information that leaves you questioning however you felt before. It's important to make sure that you don't react overemotionally. Take some time to sit with yourself and process how you are feeling about this surprise, regardless of the details. After you've worked through your feelings, you might want to have a conversation with the person who stunned you in this way.\\nSagittarius\\nNovember 22 – December 21\\nProtection might be your first instinct, but vulnerability could take you much further. Stepping up to the plate can be intimidating, especially if you've struck out in the past, but you have to keep swinging at the goals that are close to your heart or you'll never hit a home run. Not every single person around you will understand your process — they may not understand your feelings when you make them known, either. Still, you're not alone. Keeping your heart open is vital.\\nCapricorn\\nDecember 22 – January 19\\nYou might feel trapped or pulled in two directions at once. Maybe someone special in your life wants to spend time with you and get to know you on a deeper level, but you simultaneously have responsibilities that are demanding your attention and focus. Regardless, now is not a good time to make risky decisions. If another person in your midst is also taking such risks, both of you acting recklessly could result in disaster. Stay steady now to build a stable future.\\nAquarius\\nJanuary 20 – February 18\\nPast experience tells you to keep going with what you've been doing, while your instinct tells you to move beyond it. It might be that you are working tirelessly toward accomplishing your goals — but you're working harder, not smarter. While this may initially seem like too difficult of a problem to out-think, you have the creative mindset that it takes to break out of any box and elevate your whole process. Seek out ways of maximizing your returns for your efforts.\\nPisces\\nFebruary 19 – March 20\\nYou didn't sign up for this emotional rollercoaster, but here it is! Maybe you're on top of the world one moment without a care in the world, but the next, a surprise influx of information could convince you to get serious ASAP. Instead of letting this surprising information throw you off your rhythm, remind yourself that you can handle anything! Going into it with this mindset sets you up for success and lessens your overall stress. Whatever will be, will be.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"An Uber driver accused of sexually assaulting a Villanova University student after dropping her off at her dorm has been arrested and charged with rape and related offenses.\\nMirvan Dinler, 26, of Trappe, Pa. is accused of raping the 21-year-old victim after driving her to The Commons residence hall complex late Sept. 13.\\nThe student, who had gone out to a Philadelphia nightclub with some friends, said she had ordered the car because she wasn't feeling well.\\nAccording to investigators, she said she'd had five alcoholic drinks on an empty stomach, the Delaware County Daily Times reported. She began feeling sick on her way to the club and decided to call an Uber to drive her back.\\nAfter Dinler dropped her off at the residence hall, he followed her inside the building, where he sexually assaulted her.\\nAccording to authorities, Dinler picked her up around 10:19 p.m. and dropped her off at the dorm around 11:08 p.m., ABC Philadelphia reported.\\nThat's when the alleged assault occurred. Dinler followed her into her dorm, sexually assaulted her and left, officials said.\\nBut according to police, Dinler returned a short time later. He allegedly banged on her door and told an unnamed witness that he was the Uber driver who had just dropped the victim off. He also said he wanted to collect an extra fee from the victim, due to a mess he claimed was left in his car.\\nThe victim allegedly handed her phone to Dinler, who used Venmo to send $150 to an account under a different name.\\nDinler was arraigned Friday morning. He's been charged with rape, indecent assault, sexual assault, involuntary deviate sexual intercourse and other crimes, court records show. Some of the charges are enhanced because the victim was deemed to be 'substantially impaired' at the time due to the amount of alcohol she'd consumed.\\nAfter failing to post bail, set at 10% of $250,000, Dinler was remanded to the Delaware County jail in Concord, according to the Delaware County Daily Times.\\nHe's due back in court for a preliminary hearing on Oct. 17.\",\n",

'I knew right away it wasn't a gun. It was too loud, and it sounded just like a bomb.'\\nEmergency calls came in from all around Ellsworth, which is about halfway between Cleveland and Pittsburgh, Pa., according to authorities.\\nIn addition to the complete devastation of the 1,700-square-foot home that blew up, neighboring homes were knocked off their foundations and windows were blown out, WKBN reported.\\nAuthorities did not publicly comment on the cause of the explosion, though details of the blast suggested a gas leak was likely to blame. The four victims were not identified.\\n'The initial call was for a reported structure fire. That call was then upgraded to explosion. Initial crews on scene reported that the house was completely gone,' Ellsworth Assistant Fire Chief Jillian Smith told WKBN. 'It was a big scene we had. It was a lot of confusion.'\\nDebris extended half a mile from the central explosion, authorities said. The Ohio Fire Marshal is investigating the blast.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Get ready for Stop the Steal 2.0 — Republican supporters of former President Trump are gearing up for a fresh effort to undermine the vote count in 2024 if he loses to Democrat Kamala Harris.\\nIn some battleground states, notably Georgia, MAGA extremists are pushing for new rules that could permit them to delay ballot counts or even invalidate votes from Democratic-leaning areas.\\nThe GOP also has a larger and better prepared army of election lawyers ready to spring into action after the Nov. 5 vote in hopes of outdoing their failure to legally challenge Trump's loss to President Biden four years ago.\\nWith polls predicting a near dead heat between Trump and Harris, the White House battle is again likely to come down to a relative handful of votes in the seven battleground states.\\nIf Trump trails in those states, he has already signaled that he will seek to undermine the vote counts like he did in 2020.\\nDemocrats say they are confident that election officials in both red and blue states will do a fair and accurate job of counting the votes.\\nIn five of the seven battleground states, the secretaries of state are Democrats. In Georgia, Brad Raffensperger, a Republican who feuded with Trump in 2020 over his efforts to overturn his loss in the Peach state, is the top election official.\\nThat leaves Nevada as the one pivotal swing state where a pro-Trump Republican is in charge of overseeing the vote count.\\nStill, Trump's backers are pushing hard for new rules that critics say could lead to potential chaos on and after Election Day, confusion that Trump would likely harness as evidence to claim he is the real winner of the election even if he is trailing in key states, like in 2020.\\nIn Georgia, the Republican majority on the state board of canvassers passed a new rule requiring counties, some of which include millions of voters, to hand count ballots. A judge is mulling a challenge to that rule, which Democrats say could be used to delay certification of vote tallies or even toss votes from some counties if Trump allies suspect fraud.\\nSome Republican-dominated counties have sought to implement hand counts even though experts say they are expensive and prone to human error.\\nArizona's deep-red Mohave County recently narrowly rejected a plan to hand count votes i n November while rural Cochise County had to abandon a hand count amid legal challenges in 2022. An effort in Nye County, Nevada, ran into similar problems.\\nRepublicans have also raised outlandish claims about large numbers of undocumented immigrants voting in the 2024 elections.\\nAt Trump's behest, congressional Republicans pushed a new law that would have required states to require anyone registering to vote to provide proof of citizenship, like a passport or U.S. birth certificate. They dropped the effort after Democrats called it an effort to make it harder for Americans to vote.\\nThere's also a renewed threat of violence against election officials sparked in large part by Trump's fiery rhetoric denouncing election officials as part of a wide-ranging Deep State plot to deny him victory.\\nAcross the country, local election directors are beefing up security in advance of Election Day to keep their workers and polling places safe while also ensuring that ballots and voting procedures won't be tampered with.\\nElection offices and those who run them have been targets of harassment and even death threats since the 2020 presidential election, primarily by people acting on former Trump's lies that the election was stolen from him through widespread fraud or rigged voting machines.\",\n",

Nor was it clear how cops identified Matthews as a suspect.\\nWahhab, 30, had started working at both a gym and a Whole Foods Market just a week before his slaying, embracing a lifestyle focused on health and fitness, his heartbroken relatives said.\\n'He worked hard all week and just wanted to relax and enjoy his evening,' his sister Aziza Wahhab, 45, told The News about the night he was slain. 'He was into fitness since high school, big on staying fit and healthy.'\\nBefore heading out Sunday from the home he shared with his mother, Joshua had cooked and eaten. He told his mom he'd be back soon, his sister said.\\n'He didn't say exactly where he was going but he promised to return,' she said.\\nAziza said her brother would have been willing to help his killer.\\n'If [the stabber] wanted food, my brother would feed him,' she said.

       "   'summary': \"A Queens man fatally shot in the courtyard of a housing project was targeted because he came to the aid of a woman sexually assaulted on the street, according to friends and family.\\nRahsaun Williams, 39, was hanging out with friends outside the Pomonok Houses off Parsons Blvd. near 65th Ave. in Flushing around 7:30 p.m. Friday when he got a call from a woman who told him a man had just touched her inappropriately, according to those close to Williams. Just days away from his 40th birthday, Williams was shot after exchanging words with his attacker, those close to him alleged.\\n'All of this, it was about a girl,' the victim's mother, Beverly Williams, told the Daily News. 'Some young man smacked her on her backside and she picked up the phone and called Rahsaun, and he came to defend her. It's senseless.'\\n'It comes back to him being a helpful person,' Williams' mother said. 'He wasn't confrontational — he was [about] right-or-wrong, and he felt that was wrong to do to her and came to defend her.'\\nPolice initially stated they were hunting for a female shooter, but Williams' mother, and friends who witnessed the altercation, said the assailant was a man who assaulted the woman at the center of the incident, and with whom Williams had an on-again, off-again relationship.\\nWilliams was shot in both shoulders and in the abdomen, according to police, and died at New York-Presbyterian Hospital Queens, cops said.\\nFriends and family described Williams — a father of three — as loyal, charismatic, charming, outspoken and helpful.\\n'One thing about him is that his loyalty was solid, once he loved you and mess with you, he's a loyal person and everyone knew that,' said Manny Keith, Williams' best friend. 'When you needed help from him for something and it was in his reach, he would 100% do it.'\\n'This whole situation is just unfortunate. The nature of it is just statistical, stupid, 'hood, recycled incident and I just hate it. I wish I was there so I can tell him, 'Hey let's go over here' so he wouldn't be in the mix,' Keith said.\\n'He was only couple days away from his 40th birthday. This whole thing was senseless. I just wish he had more time to do more for his own life,' Keith said.\\nWilliams had recently moved into his first solo apartment, and was active in the tenant's association.\\n'He just moved into an apartment few months ago. Just as he was getting settled and steady, this happens,' his mother said. 'There's nothing he loved more than family. We are taking this hard.'\\nWilliams' mother said she was outside, walking her dogs when she got a call from a relative asking about Williams, whose nickname was 'Badness.'\\n'I got a phone call from his cousin from Atlanta, and he asked if I was OK. And then they said 'where's Badness?' and I said he's down the block with the girl,' she said. 'The cousin told me someone hit him up on Facebook and said Rahsaun got shot three times.'\\n'I put the dogs in the house, and I went running. As I was going to find out what's going on, the ambulance is going back this way and me and the ambulance passed one another,' she said.\\nWilliams' mother, who gave him his nickname before he was born, explained when she was pregnant with him she slipped in the shower and broke her ankle.\\n'I knew then he was going to be a handful,' she said. 'He was a busy body when he was a little boy. That was my heart,' she said, explaining Williams was the middle child and had two brothers.\\n'He was a good father,' said Chasnere Williams, Williams' 16-year-old daughter. 'He's very charismatic, very funny, he has hope for everybody. He never pointed anyone in the wrong direction.'\\nWilliams also had two sons, ages 4 and 2, and was studying to be a drug counselor to help vulnerable teenagers.\\n'He was going to get a laugh out of you,' said Keith. 'He was naturally funny. He was a comedian, and he didn't even know it.'\\n'I knew him since when we were in a playpen,' Keith added. 'He's a person who likes to be the center of attention, like when he comes into the room you'll know that he is there. He's a person who likes to make his presence felt.'\\nWilliams planned to celebrate his upcoming birthday with friends and family at ' Wild n' Out ' at Barclays Center. His birthday was Oct. 9.\\nHis mother said she plans to donate his organs — his skin, veins and eyes, she said.\\n'I don't know if he wanted it or not, but I would think with him being him, being helpful he would want it,' she said.\",\n",

A similar setup was installed earlier this year for the section of McGuinness Blvd. north of Calyer St.\\nThe two-lane reduction announced Wednesday for the southern section had initially been part of a more comprehensive redesign, drawn up after the 2021 hit-and-run killing of beloved Brooklyn teacher Matthew Jensen.\\nThat plan got axed by Mayor Adams' administration in 2023, making McGuinness one of several bike-lane, traffic-calming flash points between the administration, street safety advocates and local elected officials.\\nA consortium of local Brooklyn elected officials slammed the scaled-back August proposal in an open letter at the time, saying it 'fail[ed] Greenpoint by preserving the most dangerous elements of this roadway that runs through the middle of our community.'\\nBrooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, who was among those who signed onto the letter, said Wednesday that he was grateful to Adams and Joshi for agreeing to the compromise.\\n'When this goes through, the community will be deeply grateful to the administration for taking a step back [and reassessing],' he said.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"The family of a man left a quadriplegic when he was shot by an off-duty NYPD cop in a New Jersey road rage clash is suing the department for allowing the alcoholic officer to keep his service weapon while on a violent 'downward spiral.'\\nKishan Patel, 30, was driving home on May 17 when he had the misfortune of idling next to ticking 'time bomb' NYPD Officer Hieu Tran at a light near Route 73 and Cooper Road in Camden County, the suit says. Tran was arrested on June 6, charged with attempted murder, aggravated assault and weapons possession and is awaiting trial in Camden Criminal Court.\\nNew Jersey police say Tran, 27, pulled his service weapon and opened fire on Patel's pickup truck in a fit of road rage. Surveillance footage shows Patel speeding away in a panic, his truck riddled with bullets, before crashing into another vehicle while Tran drives off.\\nTran was returning from a wedding and later claimed he didn't remember what happened with Patel because he had too much to drink.\\n'After leaving Patel to bleed uncontrollably in the cab of his pickup truck, Officer Tran calmly drove north, stopped for gas, went home to New York, reloaded his weapon and went to work the next day like nothing had happened,' the lawsuit filed by Patel's family charges. 'Officer Tran was also found to have been conducting internet searches to learn about the shooting.'\\nDefendants in the federal lawsuit, filed in the Southern District of New York, include New York City, Tran, Mayor Adams, several unnamed NYPD officers and former NYPD Commissioner Edward Caban, who resigned last month amid an FBI probe into allegations that his twin brother was selling security favors to nightclubs.\\nPatel suffered massive brain and spinal cord injuries from both the shooting and the crash, his attorney Joseph Marrone wrote in court papers. Since the shooting, he's been left a quadriplegic and required 'round-the-clock medical care.'\\nDuring his detention hearing in Camden County Criminal Court, prosecutors said Tran suffers from PTSD and alcoholism. A psychologist examined Tran, who determined the young cop was on a 'downward spiral,' prosecutor Peter Gallagher said, according to court transcripts attached to the lawsuit.\\n'The doctor goes on the opine that, 'It seems inevitable that something tragic was impending in his life based upon his physical, psychological and emotional deterioration,'' Gallagher said in court. 'So if I read this correctly, the doctor's essentially opining that this was almost inevitable that this defendant was going to do something awful.'\\n'(Tran) was a powder keg or a time bomb waiting to go off,' Gallagher added. 'Chillingly, judge, this victim, Kishan Patel, by all appearances this defendant had never even met before the crime before this occurred. This victim just had the misfortune to be driving down the same road as the defendant while the defendant was driving home armed.'\\nTran was ordered held without bail during his arraignment proceeding in June.\\nDespite the cop's problems, neither the NYPD nor the city took any steps to disarm Tran or force him to get help, Marrone said. Instead, he was just 'advised' to get treatment, the lawsuit states.\\n'The NYPD did nothing to prevent Officer Tran from taking his NYPD issued weapon and using it to commit acts of violence and mayhem,' Marrone wrote.\\nJudge Michael Joyce noted during the arraignment proceeding that Tran's 'Commanding officer in New York PD told him to get treatment for (his alcoholism) and (he) didn't do it,' according to the transcript.\\n'(They) knew that Tran had significant mental health challenges with longstanding alcoholism, despite his being only twenty-seven years old,' the lawsuit states. 'Somehow, he was accepted into the NYPD and armed with a service pistol, but soon became a 'problem officer' who needed to be taken 'off the street.''\\nAfter three years with the department, Tran was moved from a Harlem precinct to the social media team of the NYPD's press office but was still allowed to be armed.\\n'The failure of the (city and the NYPD) to adopt and/or enforce adequate policies, procedures, and practices to address a longstanding problem of alcohol and substance abuse by its police officers, while both on-duty and off-duty, constituted deliberate indifference and was a proximate cause of Plaintiffs' injuries,' Marrone said.\\nBesides Patel, a woman in another car struck by the pickup truck was injured in the crash, officials said.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Now that, fellow fans, was some good baseball\\nManhattan: Re ' Saving the best for last! ' (Oct. 1): For the first time in baseball history, fans witnessed the specter of two major league teams celebrating their elevation to the postseason on the same day and same field! The Mets' extraordinary 8-7 comeback win over the Braves was the greatest regular season game in their history, which began in 1962. The Braves won the second half of the doubleheader and also made it into the postseason.\\nMy loyalties were divided throughout this riveting exhibition of baseball talent and true grit! I am a New Yorker who roots for the Mets but was an infielder in the Braves organization in the early 1960s. The fundamentally sound baseball played by the Braves in this historic game should not be a surprise to knowledgeable fans. For many decades, the Braves organization has been noted for their emphasis on scouting and player development. These vitally important fundamentals allowed the Braves to reach the postseason despite numerous injuries to their key players throughout the season. Such fundamentals were embedded in my memory bank in the three spring camps I participated in in Waycross, Ga., way back in 1961-1963.\\nMets manager Carlos Mendoza and Braves manager Brian Snitker were calling their own shots without interference from outside influences. They are throwback managers who know the game thoroughly and how to handle their players with great skill and respect on and off the field!\\nThese last two games of the 2024 regular season showed the world how the game of baseball should be played. Good luck to both clubs! Gerard Rosenthal\\nBetter method\\nLackawaxen, Pa.: The Braves' early Monday evening celebration of qualifying as a National League wild card team was appropriately subdued. They got in because the Mets, having clinched their spot, rolled over in the second game of the doubleheader. Atlanta, New York and Arizona finished with identical records for the year, but were competing for two wild card slots. Baseball requires a long season to sort out the relative abilities of its participants. Even then, injuries — in this instance, weather — may affect the outcome. Head-to-head record is a ridiculous method of differentiation. Money rules, and scheduling changes are discouraged. So, if MLB feels it can't do the right thing, it could at least employ a statistic like run differential, which gives equal weight to offense and defense over the entire season, as the distinguishing factor. John A. MacKinnon\\nOther sports\\nBronx: Why are the Daily News editorial people concerned with the Mets' and White Sox's losing records (' Never easy for the Mets,' editorial, Sept. 30) when there is a lack of reporting on hockey, horse racing, high school sports etc. in the paper? Denis Buckley\\nCut off\\nStratford, Conn.: Does anyone listen over there? Does anyone even care? I have sent multiple emails. For whatever reason, my copy of The News deletes the last one to two lines of all its columns/articles. Mike Lupica had a great Sunday column recently, and I noticed that for five out of six columns in that article, the most important facts were in those last two lines — totally wiped out! How frustrating. And I pay $3 for this? Pete Sulzicki\\nComing up short\\nGreat Neck, L.I.: Even with the Federal Transit Administration issuing a positive finding in completion of the National Environmental Policy Act Environmental Impact Statement, the $10 billion package to pay for the new Port Authority Midtown Manhattan Bus Terminal is still short $6.5 billion. The approved Port Authority 2017-2026 10-year, $32 billion Capital Plan provided only $3.5 billion toward construction. The project has yet to obtain permission for admission into the FTA Capital Investment Grant (CIG) New Starts Core Capacity Full Funding Grant Agreement national competitive discretionary grant program. It was not included in the FTA March 2024 report to Congress for funding in 2025. It is wishful thinking that the Port Authority can count on future federal funding to make up most of the $6.5 billion shortfall. Ditto for Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILOTs) from developers for the proposed project's high-rise office towers. Larry Penner\\nWorst responder\\nWoodland Park, N.J.: Donald Trump slammed the Biden-Harris response to Hurricane Helene and said that the Georgia governor could not get through to President Biden. Gov. Brian Kemp said that he did speak to Biden, and Biden responded to Trump's comment by calling Trump a liar. Did Trump expect Biden to go to the disaster zone and throw paper towels at the victims of the hurricane? John Dent\\nStay sober\\nRidgewood: So, Trump never drank — never even had a beer in his life. Smart move. He's whacked enough already. L. Tuthill\\nUnaffected?\\nBronx: To Voicer Stephen De Falco: I am assuming you are one of the five having a better life now than you were four years ago. I am also assuming you don't go to the supermarket. Maybe you should stop drinking the Kool-Aid. Mary Caggiano\\nGet serious\\nBronx: The presidential candidates should stop with the name-calling and blah-blah-blah. There are important issues that need to be addressed. There are people living paycheck to paycheck. Even with Social Security, many seniors are struggling with their bills. We need a president who cares, but more importantly, who delivers. Marsha Kolin\\nLife preserver\\nPelham, N.Y.: Democrats can continue to pick and pull apart Donald Trump for their various reasons, but one point remains: He is a better choice for president than Kamala Harris. That fact is that countless human lives will be saved by his more humane pro-life stance. With their radical pro-abortion agenda, including no time limits on taking pre-born babies' lives, the Dems show that their humanity is equivalent to that far-right political party in Germany that led to World War II. Sadly, far more innocent human lives have been taken via abortion than were excised by the Nazis. Wendy Packus\\nMake babies\\nNorth Brunswick, N.J.: Hey, how about copulating for love's purpose sans lust's pleasure!? Just might mitigate Big Pharma's bottom line, et. al, and assuage the political aftermath! Nothing is absolute, but just saying, ya dig? Ea A. Mingo\\nJudgmental advocate\\nKew Gardens Hills: It would be a huge disaster for New York City if Mayor Adams steps down and cop-hating Public Advocate Jumaane Williams becomes acting mayor. Williams is a hypocrite with a capital 'H.' Commenting about the mayor's current legal troubles, Williams said, 'Justice presumes innocence until proven guilty.' Oh really, Jumaane? Throughout your career, you have always presumed cops guilty until proven innocent. Barry Koppel\\nDealing with it\\nWhitestone: So very sorry, there must have been a death in the 'Pearls Before Swine' family, because Pig has been asking for some loving explanations and Wise Ass is doing the best he can. We too, Pig, are asking the same questions, and no, nothing we can add except, yes, they are in your heart always! Love you, Pig! Marlene Torino\\nPicks me up\\nBronx: Re 'Red and Rover': Dear sir, so glad you are back. I loved the one you came back with! I didn't like other ones you published. When Red and Rover hug, you make my day. Red and Rover make people happy, like me! I'm 82! Thank you. Maryanne Schulhoff\\nWorth 1,000 words\\nForked River, N.J.: The 'Photos From Around the World' in every Sunday's Daily News always evoke a spectrum of emotions for many of us. Some photos bring a feeling of wonderment while others can be inspiring, happy or very sad. The photo of the caged songbirds in Thailand this past Sunday was heartbreaking. It showed more than 2,500 songbirds in cages suspended on very tall poles for as far as the eye can see. A colorful creature that was meant to fly, find a mate and raise the next generation instead finds itself a prisoner behind bars; thousands of them feeling the wind on their feathers and the warmth of a sunny blue sky from their prisons in the sky. All of this for the amusement of humans, many of whom kill thousands of these birds by smuggling them into other countries. Jim Hughes\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Tim Walz and JD Vance on Tuesday went after each other's running mates in a vice presidential debate that opened with a discussion of burgeoning domestic and international troubles — a hurricane that ravaged much of the Southeast U.S. and growing fears of a regional Middle East war.\\nBoth Walz, the Democratic governor of Minnesota, and Vance, a Republican senator from Ohio, focused many of their largely cordial attack lines on the top of the ticket, as is traditional for VP debates. They each pointed to the crises of the day as reasons for voters to choose Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump.\\nThe debate unfolded in the final weeks of a campaign that has been defined by harsh, personal attacks and historic convulsions, including a candidate dropping out and two attempted assassinations. Polls have shown Harris and Trump locked in a close contest as early voting begins across the country, giving added weight to anything that can sway voters on the margins, including the impression left by the vice presidential candidates.\\nThe heated tone of the campaign was mostly replaced by deep policy discussions, with the candidates sometimes saying they agreed with each other — even as they outlined vastly different visions about the future of the country.\\nIn one raw moment when Walz said his teenage son had witnessed a shooting at a community center, Vance expressed empathy.\\n'I'm sorry about that. Christ have mercy,' Vance said.\\n'I appreciate that,' Walz said.\\nThe former president, who sought the spotlight himself Tuesday by posting live commentary online during the debate, was a central focus as both Walz and Vance argued over whether Americans should return him to the Oval Office.\\nWalz depicted Trump as wrong on the issues and a chaotic leader. Vance rebuffed him with every answer and made the case for the man he once heavily criticized.\\n'What's fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter,' said Walz, the Democratic governor of Minnesota, said in response to a question about the situation unfolding in the Middle East. 'And the world saw it on that debate stage a few weeks ago, a nearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not what we need in this moment.'\\nVance, in his reply, argued that Trump is an intimidating figure whose presence on the international stage is its own deterrent.\\n'Gov. Walz can criticize Donald Trump's tweets, but effective smart diplomacy and peace through strength is how you bring stability back to a very broken world,' he said.\\nThe debate in New York hosted by CBS News opened with a sober tone that reflected growing domestic and international concerns about safety and security. But it gave way to sharper attacks from both Walz and Vance — and a moment in which the moderators stopped the discussion by cutting the two men's mics.\\nWalz accused Vance and Trump of villainizing legal immigrants in Vance's home state. He pointed to the fact that Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine had to send in extra law enforcement to provide security to the city's schools after Vance tweeted about and Trump amplified false claims about Haitians eating pets.\\n'This is what happens when you don't want to solve it, you demonize it,' Walz said, saying not doing so would allow people to 'come together.'\\nVance said the 15,000 Haitians in the city had caused housing, economic and other issues that the Biden-Harris administration was ignoring.\\nWhen the debate moderators pointed out that the Haitians living there had legal status, Vance protested that CBS News had said its moderators would not be fact-checking, leaving the onus to the candidates. As Vance continued and the moderators tried to move on, his microphone was cut and neither man could be heard.\\nThe two Midwesterners struck a noticeably friendlier tone than the matchup between Trump and Harris — or, earlier this year, the showdown between Trump and President Biden before he dropped out of the race following a disastrous performance.\\nWhen they first turned to immigration and the influx of migrants coming over the U.S.-Mexico border, one of the most heated topics of the campaign, the two men credited each other with having good intentions.\\n'I believe Sen. Vance wants to solve this, but by standing with Donald Trump and not working together to find a solution, it becomes a talking point and when it becomes a talking point like this, we dehumanize and villainize other human beings,' Walz said.\\nVance echoed the sentiment, saying, 'I think you want to solve this problem, but I don't think that Kamala Harris does.'\\nWalz catapulted onto Harris' campaign by branding Trump and Republicans as ' just weird,' creating an attack line for Democrats seeking to argue Republicans are disconnected from the American people. But for almost the entire debate, he never used the word.\\nVance's occasionally confrontational interviews and appearances have underscored why Trump picked him for the Republican ticket.\\nVance in particular seemed to be attempting to soften his aggressive image, ratcheting down his typically forceful delivery, referring to Walz as 'Tim' and a more supple approach, saying at one point, 'I know a lot of Americans don't agree with everything that I've ever said on this topic.'\\nHis efforts to explain Trump's policies and positions with a more gentle touch were also reminiscent of how former Vice President Mike Pence often operated when he and Trump were in the White House.\\nThe two broke over Pence's refusal to join his efforts to try to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\\nThe role of a presidential running mate is typically to serve as an attack dog for the person at the top of the ticket, arguing against the opposing presidential candidate and their proxy on stage. Both Vance and Walz have embraced that role.\\nVance was asked to address his past biting criticisms of the former president, including once suggesting Trump would be 'America's Hitler.'\\n'When you get something wrong and you change your mind, you ought to be honest with the American people,' he said Tuesday.\\nWalz, meanwhile, was pressed on his misleading claim, which was investigated this week by Minnesota Public Radio and other outlets, that he was in Hong Kong during the turbulence surrounding the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, part of a broader pattern of inaccuracies that Republicans hope to exploit.\\nConfronted with his misstatements about his travels to China years ago, Walz defended himself by saying, 'I've not been perfect.' In fact, he said, 'I'm a knucklehead at times.' Eventually, he acknowledged he misspoke about his history.\\nOriginally Published: October 1, 2024 at 11:09 p.m.\",\n",

       "   'excerpt': 'The Mets proved once again that the word quit is not in their collective vocabulary.',\n",
       "   'summary': \"MILWAUKEE — Less than 24 hours after Steve Cohen marveled at the resiliency of his baseball team, the Mets proved once again that the word quit is not in their collective vocabulary.\\nCall it momentum or call it grit, but whatever it was, it led to an 8-4 win over the Milwaukee Brewers in the first game of the postseason Tuesday at American Family Field. The Mets had the last laugh in a back-and-forth NL Wild Card battle, answering back every time the Brewers scored before putting the game away with a five-run fifth inning.\\nRight-hander Luis Severino twice gave up leads and got into trouble with his pitch count early in the game before settling in to give the Mets six innings. After giving up two runs in the bottom of the fourth to leave the Mets down by one run, 4-3, it looked as though he was done with the bullpen busy and little room for error.\\nBut after the five-run fifth, the Mets were able to squeeze two more innings out of the veteran. Severino was charged with four earned runs on eight hits, walking two and striking out three. He retired his final six in order to save a bullpen that has been heavy on innings as of late.\\nThe Brewers were rested after Monday's off-day and had their ace on the mound, right-hander Freddy Peralta, ready to fire up the home crowd, which is exactly what he did with a 1-2-3 first inning.\\nSeverino was also rested, having last pitched a week ago in Atlanta against the Braves. He was shaky in that outing and shaky at the start of this one as well, giving up a run to Milwaukee before getting the first out, and hitting Rhys Hoskins with two outs and the bases loaded to give up a second one. He needed 24 pitches to get through the first inning, but he managed to strand two to end it.\\nPeralta put the first two on in the top of the second to bring up Jesse Winker, a former Brewer who drew the ire of the fanbase by hitting just .199 in 61 games last season. Winker was booed all weekend when the Mets played their final regular season series in the same park. But booing Winker only seems to embolden him.\\nHe battled Peralta for seven pitches before getting a changeup on a full count for the eighth and lining it to right field for a two-run triple. The Mets went ahead 3-2.\\nSeverino then battled traffic on the bases in the second and third innings, but ultimately held the lead until the fourth. Brice Turang, who killed the Mets all weekend, tied the game with an infield single. Jackson Chourio doubled him home to give the home team a 4-3 lead.\\nBut then the Brewers went to the bullpen, replacing Peralta after three earned runs and five strikeouts over four innings. Joel Payamps was hit hard right away with Chourio robbing Starling Marte of a home run at the left field wall.\\nFormer Brewers outfielder Tyrone Taylor then doubled to spark a rally. With one out, Francisco Lindor walked and Jose Iglesias sent Taylor home with what might have been the most clutch hustle play of the day. Iglesias sent a hard grounder to first baseman Rhys Hoskins, who was playing in the gap halfway between second and first base. He made a diving stop and flipped to Payamps, but Iglesias slid head first and Payamps was off the bag.\\nIglesias made it in safely, as did Taylor, tying the game.\\nLeft-hander Aaron Ashby did little to stop the bleeding, giving up hits to Brandon Nimmo and Mark Vientos, then walking Pete Alonso intentionally to load the bases. J.D. Martinez pinch-hit for Winker, driving in two more with an opposite-field single.\\nJose Butto and Ryne Stanek finished the game, holding the Brewers scoreless and putting the Mets one game away from advancing to the NLDS.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"General Daily Insight for October 05, 2024\\nWe're getting real with each other. The sensitive Moon trines disciplined Saturn, empowering our ability to be mature and encouraging us to be realistic regarding how we express ourselves. The Moon conjoins balanced Venus in investigative Scorpio at 2:28 pm EDT, giving us the motivation to get to the heart of the matter and deliver the information well. Finally, the Moon and dynamic Mars elevate each other, so fortune favors the brave even more under their energy. Courage and tact will combine especially well.\\nAries\\nMarch 21 – April 19\\nDeep subjects are likely to be on the horizon for you. You might not have expected to be talking about serious matters or delicate secrets, but someone in your life may bring them to your doorstep at any moment. It's important to know what your boundaries are and to express them clearly, so that feelings aren't hurt in the end. The more that you're able to create healthy expectations together from the beginning, the more likely the conversations are to go smoothly.\\nTaurus\\nApril 20 – May 20\\nThe importance of balancing give and take in your connections with others cannot be overstated. Where they might be struggling, you're probably capable of taking up the slack and helping them get back up on their feet, and vice versa. Alternatively, if someone is actively showing you that they aren't willing to show up for you in the same way that you would do for them, it could be time to move on from this connection. Pursue those that make you feel supported.\\nGemini\\nMay 21 – June 20\\nYour dedicated efforts are presently more likely to be noticed. Working hard to deliver consistent results and being confident in the work that you've done is a great way to move up the ladder, and should provide you with an opportunity to impress authorities. Outside of business, this is a good time to spend time with your elders or your mentors, as these people can encourage you or offer advice on how to get wherever you're trying to go. Stay the course!\\nCancer\\nJune 21 – July 22\\nTaking a risk can take you enticingly far. You're being encouraged to release any unreasonable fears around putting yourself out there, because there's likely someone looking for someone just like you. Whether they're looking for a new friend or a wise employee, it's important for you to step up and make your abilities known. This could happen at a party, a job fair, or when simply out on the town. They're probably not going to find you at home, so meet them in the middle!\\nLeo\\nJuly 23 – August 22\\nYou might be realizing that home is where your heart is. While it is important to spread your wings and show the world who you are and what you can do, it's also important to go back home and connect with your roots once in a while. You likely have strong family ties, or people that you are very close with that you haven't visited in a while. Honor where you come from by showing love to that place and those people.\\nVirgo\\nAugust 23 – September 22\\nLearning about who you are may involve the people around you. They say that you become like those who you spend time with — and you should pay attention to who you're becoming more like. If you're excited to be like these people, then you're on the right track. If you're worried that you're not able to be your true self or their company feels stagnant, step back. Seek out those who live authentically and encourage you to do so as well.\\nLibra\\nSeptember 23 – October 22\\nYou might be setting up a future win. Even if not much happens today specifically, you're setting up all of the pieces of the puzzle that will eventually ensure your dreams of the future will be able to become real. While it might not all come together to make the big picture that you're looking for in the present, you're setting up great things for yourself in the future by making such stabilizing decisions. Plant the acorn that will become the tree.\\nScorpio\\nOctober 23 – November 21\\nAllowing yourself to grow always carries some risk with it. There may be people in your life who don't want you to grow so quickly — maybe they're worried you'll outpace and then abandon them. It's important to let them know that you're not trying to leave them behind! You likely want your pals to grow with you, but you can't make that decision for them. You can remain friends without being on the exact same level. Real friends shouldn't hold you back.\\nSagittarius\\nNovember 22 – December 21\\nYour best work might be done in the dark. It's crucial for you to embrace performing behind the scenes, because putting yourself out there could, counterintuitively, cause people to overlook you. If you're doing an excellent job in the background, someone should notice you putting your head down and doing the work that needs to be done, rather than trying to steal the spotlight. For current success, it's not about who's the most noticeable. It's about who's doing the best job with focus and dedication.\\nCapricorn\\nDecember 22 – January 19\\nSay what you've been wanting to say, Capricorn. There might be someone in your midst that you've been meaning to say something to, but there just has never been the right moment. It understandably can be somewhat daunting to wear your heart on your sleeve, but be honest with yourself and with them. What's most important is your delivery, so think about how your words would sound from their perspective before you say anything. Regardless of the topic, set yourself up for communicative success.\\nAquarius\\nJanuary 20 – February 18\\nTake a chance on who you could become. Your beliefs about yourself could be limiting your soul — it's time to break free from whatever narrative that you tell yourself about yourself! You may be your own main critic at this time. Take a look around and notice any people who are waiting in the wings to cheer for you without you even realizing. Once you finally take a chance and begin constructing your dreams in reality, the support might start flooding in.\\nPisces\\nFebruary 19 – March 20\\nYour ideology is growing up with you. You may have followed a belief system up until now, but it's starting to not make sense with who you are becoming. Instead of trying to shove yourself back into a box that no longer fits you, consider studying alternate mindsets that could allow you to flourish. Whether this is about a religious belief or a personal belief about life in general, it's important that you analyze it to make sure it's continuing to work for you.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Kim Kardashian is once again using her celebrity to fight for prison reform — this time calling for freedom to be granted to the controversial Menendez brothers.\\nThe reality superstar has called for the release of Lyle and Erik Menendez, the siblings serving a life sentence for the brutal 1989 killings of their parents.\\nIn an essay published Thursday on NBC News, Kardashian wrote that her 'hope is that Erik and Lyle Menendez's life sentences are reconsidered.'\\n'We are all products of our experiences. They shape who we were, who we are, and who we will be. Physiologically and psychologically, time changes us, and I doubt anyone would claim to be the same person they were at 18,' Kardashian wrote.\\nAfter two widely watched trials, the Menendez brothers (then ages 21 and 18) were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for the first-degree murder of their parents in their Beverly Hills mansion in 1989.\\nThe siblings have maintained that the killings were the result of yearslong sexual abuse and molestation at the hands of their father, high-ranking record executive José Menendez. The brothers also claimed their mother Mary Louise, known as 'Kitty,' was an accomplice in the abuse.\\n'As is often the case, this story is much more complex than it appears on the surface,' Kardashian wrote, noting that 'both brothers said they had been sexually, physically and emotionally abused for years by their parents.'\\nShe also confirmed she visited San Diego's Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility in mid-September to meet with the brothers.\\nOutside of her pursuits as a billionaire beauty mogul and star of a reality TV empire, Kardashian — who passed the California 'baby bar' in 2021 — has become a fierce public advocate for criminal justice reform. She has previously worked closely with both the Trump and Biden administrations to fight for the release of a number of different prisoners.\\nDuring a press conference on Thursday, L.A. County District Attorney George Gascón announced his office would review new evidence in the Menendez case that could eventually lead to their own release.\\nOn the heels of Ryan Murphy's controversial Netflix series ' Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story,' there's been a renewed interest in the case and discussion around whether the brothers should still be behind bars.\\nMurphy — who also helmed true crime series based on Jeffrey Dahmer, Aaron Hernandez and Monica Lewinsky — told Variety in an interview Thursday that he believes the brothers 'can be out of prison by Christmas. I really believe that.'\",\n",

Kennedy Jr. and his actor wife Cheryl Hines have reportedly not been speaking as affair rumors involving the former presidential candidate have continued to surface over the past two weeks, leading many to speculate that they're headed for divorce.\\nAccording to People, Kennedy and Hines 'have barely spoken' since New York magazine announced Sept. 20 it had placed political correspondent Olivia Nuzzi on leave following reports that she 'engaged in a personal relationship' with 70-year-old Kennedy.\\nThe relationship allegedly began shortly after 31-year-old Nuzzi interviewed RFK for a New York profile published in November 2023. While Nuzzi later said the relationship was 'never physical,' subsequent reports claimed the romance included sexting.\\n'She's embarrassed because he got caught,' a source told People of Hines, who was spotted celebrating a birthday in Spain without her husband or her wedding ring shortly after the scandal broke.\\nThe 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' star has not publicly commented on the matter, though rumors have swirled that she's been considering divorce. Hines, 59, has been married to Kennedy since 2014.\\nSeveral other women have since said they've had affairs with Kennedy within the past year — claims he's denied through a spokesperson.\\n'Mr. Kennedy has had no romantic relationships with any woman other than his wife since their marriage,' a rep said in a statement to Mediaite, which first reported on the additional affairs earlier this week.\\nThe situation has apparently not been helped by reports that Hines is less than enthused that her husband ended his presidential bid and endorsed Donald Trump in August.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Earlier this season, Casey Dykes walked into the Yankees' pregame hitters' meeting wearing a blue umbrella hat.\\nWhy, the Daily News wondered, would the assistant hitting coach need such headwear for a meeting about the opposition's pitching staff?\\n'I don't wanna answer that,' said Oswaldo Cabrera, typically bubbly and open with reporters.\\n'I don't have an answer for that one,' insisted lead hitting coach James Rowson, who cracked up at the question. 'I'm not telling you your eyes deceived you.'\\nWhen confronted, Dykes declined to comment on his rain-shielding cap. He took the same approach to general inquiries regarding the Yankees' hitters' meetings.\\n'Confidential,' Dykes said with a smile. 'I'm not gonna go into detail on that.'\\nOther Yankees, seemingly bound by secrecy, offered similar answers when asked about the meetings throughout the season.\\n'That's for the hitters to know, baby,' Alex Verdugo said.\\n'We just prepare for the pitchers that night,' Jon Berti claimed. 'I don't know if I can go into more detail than that.'\\n'I can't tell you everything that we do in there,' Juan Soto added, 'but we're going through the other team and trying to find a way to beat them.'\\nThe Yankees' hitters have a raucous way of doing that, though it remains unclear exactly what the process entails because their meetings take place in a war room adjacent to the clubhouse when the team plays at Yankee Stadium.\\nTwo closed doors with clouded panes make it impossible to know precisely what happens behind them. But flashing, colorful lights can be seen through the glass on a near-daily basis, as the Yankees' meetings overlap with the 50 minutes of clubhouse access reporters are given before games.\\nThe doors also can't block out the boisterous screams or ear-splitting songs, like Ava Max's 'My Head & My Heart,' Shakira's 'Hips Don't Lie,' and Luis Fonsi's 'Despacito' — to name a few examples — that have loudly soundtracked the meetings. It's not uncommon for the tunes to be played via music videos that feature bikini-clad women.\\n'It's just normal hitters' meeting stuff!' Jahmai Jones swore when told the gatherings sound more like parties, though he failed to convey a serious tone as he kept repeating himself.\\nThe Yankees often tried to recreate this club-like environment on the road, though smaller facilities and sound systems didn't always allow for such energized assemblies.\\n'To keep it simple, we're just getting these guys ready for the game,' Rowson said, adding that players organically created the vibe of these meetings. 'That's kind of the gist. But you know what? In order to do it, you gotta have some fun, right? So we're creating the atmosphere to get in there and get ready to win games. It's a lot of fun. The guys enjoy it.'\\nThat they do.\\nWhile only Austin Wells shared details about one particular meeting after it included a viral video of him dancing, the Yankees certainly sound fond of the powwows.\\n'It's a good hitters' meeting,' Verdugo emphasized.\\nBerti and Cabrera added that the lively summits have created a strong bond within the group.\\n'We try to enjoy everybody so that it feels like a family,' Cabrera said.\\nWhatever the Yankees do in their meetings, it worked during the regular season.\\nWhile not always consistent and sometimes over-reliant on Soto and Aaron Judge, who combined for 99 home runs and 253 RBI, the playoff-bound Bombers had one of baseball's top offenses this season. With the American League Division Series on deck, they ranked first in home runs (237), BB% (10.8), Barrel% (10.5), exit velocity (90.1 mph) and pitches seen (24,962) while placing second in wRC+ (117) and Hard-Hit% (42.3).\\nThe Yankees also finished third in fWAR (33.7), RBI (782), runs scored (815), on-base percentage (.333), OPS (.761) and plate appearances (6,245); fourth in slugging (.429); and ninth in average (.248) and K% (21.2).\\nWith numbers like that, it's a wonder why all of the Yankees' meetings aren't held in a similar style.\\n'We're a little more business-oriented than those guys are,' said pitching coach Matt Blake. 'I don't know if we get to the level of fun that they do.'\\nBlake noted that the Yankees' pitchers typically only meet before the start of each series. The hitters, however, meet every day.\\nWith the season being so long, spicing things up avoids monotony.\\n'When you do it 162 times, you gotta find a way to make it interesting,' Soto said.\\nSome could certainly observe the hitters' meetings from outside the war room doors and ask if the Yankees are having too much fun. But Rowson, in his first year as the team's hitting coach, doesn't see it that way.\\nAs far as he's concerned, preparation and having a good time go 'hand in hand.'\\n'It doesn't have to be dull and boring and just going through things,' said Rowson, a former Yankees minor leaguer.

       "   'summary': \"General Daily Insight for October 04, 2024\\nWe might feel like we're spinning our wheels. Initially, speedy Mercury struggles against methodical Saturn, which can be frustrating when we're in a hurry to get somewhere. Later on, the emotional Moon squares transformative Pluto right before moving into Pluto's home sign of Scorpio. We should brace for potential emotional whiplash if we're not already prepared for it! Finally, perfectionist Venus harmonizes with Saturn at 1:04 pm EDT, allowing us to find a speed that works. Not too fast, not too slow — just right.\\nAries\\nMarch 21 – April 19\\nSomeone else's confusing communication could get in the way of your progress. You might find that you're struggling to keep everything running smoothly through their turmoil. Jumping ship to hide yourself from the noise probably sounds pretty enticing. Instead of letting other people get in your head and distract you or make your decisions for you, take a breath and keep going. You're capable of calling the shots in a clear and concise way. You can make it through the fog!\\nTaurus\\nApril 20 – May 20\\nYou may see a clear path forward to your dreams — that is, until someone else blocks your view. Rather than showing you a different way to achieve your goals, they might have decided to fully block them. If they're unwilling to step aside and allow you to follow your heart's desire, then you may want to rethink certain connections in your life. Someone who supports you shouldn't stand in the way of your dream (as long as chasing it wasn't hurting anyone).\\nGemini\\nMay 21 – June 20\\nYou might make a snap decision that you end up regretting. Even if you calculated the risk ahead of time, there's a dangerous chance that the odds simply aren't in your favor. The situation may go from okay to extremely chaotic in what feels like no time at all! It's okay — just try and maintain equilibrium for the time being. Sometimes taking a risk pays off, but today is unlikely to be one of those days. Be patient as you think things through.\\nCancer\\nJune 21 – July 22\\nYour comfort zone could be getting in the way of your progress. Someone may make a comment to you that makes you notice the amount of time you spend at home, rather than out and about connecting with others. Watch out for some FOMO! To combat that, consider taking a leap of faith and reaching out to an acquaintance. Keep in mind that you'll be able to come back to your comfort zone later. Balancing discomfort and comfort is the best way to grow.\\nLeo\\nJuly 23 – August 22\\nYour words might not be taken the way you meant them. You might have spoken innocently, but someone points their finger and tells you that you should have known better, when you genuinely didn't. This can be embarrassing, but at the end of the day, your need for reflection shouldn't require shame. Learn as you go and always treat others how you'd like to be treated. If someone is trying to embarrass you rather than educate you, take their opinion with a grain of salt.\\nVirgo\\nAugust 23 – September 22\\nSomeone who you thought was a safe person to talk to may accidentally reveal that they're less than trustworthy. It could be that they've changed in the recent past, or you potentially don't know them as well as you thought you did. Either way, you're probably trying to pick up the pieces after they've disappointed you. They may try to get back into your good graces, but it's important to maintain your boundaries at this time. You don't have to be unkind, just firm.\\nLibra\\nSeptember 23 – October 22\\nA lack of routine could be preventing you from getting where you want to go. You might have thought that you were far closer to reaching a goal than you actually are. When faced with your true level of progress at present, you could be discouraged and want to give up. Instead of surrendering, ask yourself where you'd realistically be able to put in more effort and consistency, as those could be the missing ingredients. If you don't succeed, try, try again!\\nScorpio\\nOctober 23 – November 21\\nExhaustion may trip you into making decisions that you wouldn't normally make. Details can slip through the cracks when you're feeling overwhelmed. You could also be trying to cram too many things into one day's schedule, leading you to only half-accomplish everything that you're working on, or ending up with you having to go back and correct mistakes. Instead of beating yourself up for not being able to do more, ask yourself why you feel the need to do so much. You're only one person!\\nSagittarius\\nNovember 22 – December 21\\nYour fear of being tied down may conflict with your dreams. Your sign is known for being a free spirit, but sometimes being able to do whatever you want, whenever you want, isn't a great structure to support building your dreams in reality. This can be frustrating, particularly if you've been longing to realize those ambitions for quite some time. It's important to be honest with yourself about where your ideal balance between freedom and commitment lies, because that is the key to obtaining both.\\nCapricorn\\nDecember 22 – January 19\\nIt might be difficult for you to express yourself to others throughout the day. You might feel as if you need to hide what you're truly feeling to be impressive, but your honesty and your ability to get to the point are potentially some of your most valuable assets. You have the ability to cut right to the chase! Okay, maybe your words can be a bit blunt, but softening too much will lessen your impact. Share your experiences with clear, balanced honesty.\\nAquarius\\nJanuary 20 – February 18\\nObstacles that you didn't anticipate might require you to learn something to overcome them. You may realize that your education is lacking when it comes to a certain subject, and you previously weren't aware that this topic was so relevant to whatever you're working on. While it can be daunting to try and learn something on a large scale, try breaking it down into more manageable pieces and create a schedule. That should make the whole process more manageable. Keep going!\\nPisces\\nFebruary 19 – March 20\\nYou might be forced to make some decisions all alone. It could be that you're desperately seeking someone who will give you clear answers to what you need to do, but the truth is, you're dealing with something that only you can decide for yourself. Fears or no fears, as long as you are listening to your heart and not making this decision in response to any outside pressures, you'll probably find yourself on the right track sooner or later. Trust yourself.\",\n",

       "   'excerpt': 'The union representing 45,000 striking U.S. dockworkers at East and Gulf coast ports reached a deal Thursday to suspend a three-day strike until Jan. 15 to provide time to negotiate a new contract.',\n",
       "   'summary': \"DETROIT — The union representing 45,000 striking U.S. dockworkers at East and Gulf coast ports reached a deal Thursday to suspend a three-day strike until Jan. 15 to provide time to negotiate a new contract.\\nThe union, the International Longshoremen's Association, is to resume working immediately. The temporary end to the strike came after the union and the U.S. Maritime Alliance, which represents ports and shipping companies, reached a tentative agreement on wages, the union and ports said in a joint statement.\\nA person briefed on the agreement said the ports sweetened their wage offer from about 50% over six years to 62%. The person didn't want to be identified because the agreement is tentative. Any wage increase would have to be approved by union members as part of the ratification of a final contract.\\nThe union went on strike early Tuesday after its contract expired in a dispute over pay and the automation of tasks at 36 ports stretching from Maine to Texas. The strike came at the peak of the holiday shopping season at the ports, which handle about half the cargo from ships coming into and out of the United States.\\nThe walkout raised the risk of shortages of goods on store shelves if it lasted more than a few weeks. Most retailers, though, had stocked up or shipped items early in anticipation of the dockworkers' strike.\\n'With the grace of God, and the goodwill of neighbors, it's gonna hold,' President Joe Biden told reporters Thursday night after the agreement.\\nIn a statement later, Biden applauded both sides 'for acting patriotically to reopen our ports and ensure the availability of critical supplies for Hurricane Helene recovery and rebuilding.'\\nBiden said that collective bargaining is 'critical to building a stronger economy from the middle out and the bottom up.'\\nThe union's membership won't need to vote on the temporary suspension of the strike, meaning that giant cranes should start loading and unloading shipping containers Thursday night. Until Jan. 15, the workers will be covered under the old contract, which expired on Sept. 30.\\nThe union had been demanding a 77% raise over six years, plus a complete ban on the use of automation at the ports, which members see as a threat to their jobs. Both sides also have been apart on the issues of pension contributions and the distribution of royalties paid on containers that are moved by workers.\\nThomas Kohler, who teaches labor and employment law at Boston College, said the agreement to halt the strike means that the two sides are close to a final deal.\\n'I'm sure that if they weren't going anywhere they wouldn't have suspended (the strike),' he said. 'They've got wages. They'll work out the language on automation, and I'm sure that what this really means is it gives the parties time to sit down and get exactly the language they can both live with.'\\nIndustry analysts have said that for every day of a port strike it takes four to six days to recover. But they said a short strike of a few days probably wouldn't gum up the supply chain too badly.\\nKohler said the surprise end to the strike may catch railroads with cars, engines and crews out of position. But railroads are likely to work quickly to fix that.\\nJust before the strike had begun, the Maritime Alliance said both sides had moved off their original wage offers, a tentative sign of progress.\\nThe settlement pushes the strike and any potential shortages past the November presidential election, eliminating a potential liability for Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee. It's also a big plus for the Biden-Harris administration, which has billed itself as the most union friendly in American history.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Cheryl Hines has reportedly reached the limits of her marriage to the 'egomaniacal' and politically polarizing Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and is considering a divorce, according to Kennedy's biographer.\\nThese limits have been reached following revelations of Kennedy's allegedly 'bizarre' sexting relationship with Olivia Nuzzi, a much younger political journalist, while he was running for president, writes Jerry Oppenheimer, the author of the 2015 book, 'RFK Jr.: Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and the Dark Side of the Dream.'\\nEven if the relationship never became 'physical,' as Nuzzi has claimed, the nature of it has made it clear to Hines that her 70-year-old husband has not brought his 'sex demons' under control as he promised, Oppenheimer has written in a column for the Daily Mail.\\nOppenheimer quoted a confidante of Hines, 59, who said that the 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' actor was 'blindsided' by revelations about the 'personal relationship' with Nuzzi, 31.\\n'Cheryl was always very aware that Bobby had a long history of womanizing,' the friend told Oppenheimer. 'She herself had become very publicly involved with him when he was still married to his second wife, so his playing around wasn't anything new to her.'\\n'However, she firmly believed Bobby, in his seventh decade and with political aspirations, finally had his sex demons under control, and appeared settled down in their seemingly bucolic southern California domestic life,' the friend continued.\\n'She adored being a member of America's royal family, and having the famous Kennedy name attached to hers, but now she's thoroughly embarrassed and furious about his adulterous actions and (friends) believe she wants out,' the friend also told Oppenheimer.\\nSources talking to Page Six agreed Wednesday that Hines is likely to leave Kennedy, but they said the lifelong Democrat is less upset by his alleged infidelity and more dismayed his endorsement of Donald Trump's presidential candidacy and his newfound position in Trump's MAGA universe. 'The guy is a serial philanderer and she knew that coming in,' one source told Page Six.\\nIn his book, Oppenheimer previously wrote that Hines' friends were 'mystified' by her choice to marry Kennedy, according to the Daily Beast. 'Any woman who gets involved with Bobby does so with her eyes open, or their brains lopped off. Any woman who thinks they're going to change Bobby is misguided and purposefully ignorant,' wrote Oppenheimer, who attended the couple's 2014 at the storied Kennedy compound in Hyannis port.\\nIn the past several years, Hines has put up with a lot even if she had her 'eyes open.' Kennedy, a former environmental lawyer, has became increasingly vocal in fomenting conspiracy theories and anti-vaccine rhetoric that put him at odds with members of his own family and put her in a difficult position with her colleagues in liberal Hollywood.\\nHines continued to 'walk a fine line' and play the role of publicly supportive spouse as her husband, the son of Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of John F. Kennedy, launched an independent presidential campaign that threatened to spoil Joe Biden's prospects, according to Vanity Fair. Hines even had her husband's back when he ended his campaign this summer and threw his support to Trump — a move that Kennedy himself told The Hollywood Reporter caused her 'a lot of discomfort.'\\nAround the same time, the 'egomaniacal' Kennedy 'upped the ante' for embarrassing behavior, with allegations coming in a July Vanity Fair report that he sexually assaulted a former babysitter to his children, along with revelations about how he staged an elaborate bear-cub murder scene in Central Park and beheaded a whale.\\n'The latest item added to RFK Jr.'s pile of shame' is the alleged inappropriate sexting affair with Nuzzi, a star political writer for New York magazine, Vanity Fair said.\\nLate last month, Nuzzi acknowledged having a 'personal relationship' with Kennedy while covering his campaign. In an editor's note to readers, New York magazine said that Nuzzi was placed on leave due to the relationship being 'in violation of the magazine's standards around conflicts of interest and disclosures.'\\nNuzzi shared a statement of her own to the media, confirming that 'the nature of some communication' between herself and 'a former reporting subject turned personal.' But she added that she 'did not directly report on the subject nor use them as a source' during that period.\\nNuzzi has since gone to court, accusing her ex-fiancé Ryan Lizza, a prominent political journalist with Politico, of threatening to go public with personal information about her that could 'destroy' her life, career and reputation, if she did not stay in a relationship with him, CNN reported.\\nA representative for Kennedy initially said that Kennedy only met Nuzzi once, when she visited him at his home in Los Angeles to interview him for a November 2023 New York magazine profile. Last week, surrogates for Kennedy tried to put forward claims that an 'obsessed' Nuzzi pursued the candidate and tried to 'set (him) up' by repeatedly sending him pornographic photographs of herself, even after he blocked her number.\\n'This had nothing to do with romance,' Gavin de Becker, a security expert hired by Kennedy to deal with the Nuzzi situation, said in an interview for a Kennedy ally's Substack. 'He was being chased by porn.'\\nBut another report in Page Six suggested that Kennedy was a willing participant in the relationship, with Nuzzi's friends saying he initiated the romance by 'lovebombing her.' She and Kennedy also enjoyed 'incredible' FaceTime sessions, with the journalist telling friends she was impressed by the 70-year-old's 'sexual stamina' and claiming that they told each other they loved each other, Page Six also reported.\\nAmid all this growing drama, Hines spent time in Europe, at Fashion Weeks in Milan and then in Paris. While in Paris, she 'flashed her wedding ring' when spotted by photographers, Oppenheimer reported.\\nBut the author believes that her marriage to Kennedy is 'nearing its end' because of the Nuzzi scandal. For his biography of Kennedy, Oppenheimer investigated all three of his marriages. In the first two, 'his obsessive womanizing would play a role in the unions' failing,' Oppenheimer wrote.\\nThe New York Post reported in 2013 that Kennedy kept a diary that detailed his sexual relationships with dozens of other women while married to his second wife, Mary Richardson Kennedy. Kennedy's diary ended up in the hands of the New York Post after Richardson died by suicide in 2012.\\n'And now it appears his third marriage, with Hines, is nearing an end because of the sexting affair,' Oppenheimer wrote.\\nOppenheimer quoted another 'insider' who said: 'Bobby's like a sexual Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde — he's been that way for decades — and when the opportunity arises with a woman — in his case, just about any woman — the monster side surfaces and controls his brain. I suspect that's what happened once again when he got entangled in his online sexual relationship with Olivia.'\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"NYC Schools Chancellor David Banks on Thursday said he was forced to resign earlier than planned by Mayor Adams — a move that comes as Gov. Hochul places pressure on Adams to clear his administration of top officials involved in federal corruption probes.\\n'Last week, I announced my planned retirement, and I was ready, willing and able to stay in my post until December 31st to conduct a responsible transition for our staff,' Banks said in a statement. 'The Mayor has decided to accelerate that timeline.'\\nBanks had previously announced plans to retire at the end of the calendar year, but will now be stepping down by mid-October, City Hall announced late Wednesday. Deputy Chancellor Melissa Aviles-Ramos will take over as chancellor starting Oct. 16.\\nGov. Hochul, who has significant leverage over the mayor as she has the power to boot him from office, has reportedly told Adams to ax top administration officials who are ensnared in sweeping federal corruption investigations. Sources previously told the Daily News that Adams pushed Banks out to meet that demand.\\nAdams alluded to 'conversations with other leaders' as a reason for Banks' earlier-than-planned resignation.\\n'To have both Melissa and David there at the same time, it didn't bring the stability that we wanted,' Adams told reporters Thursday.\\nLast week, Adams pleaded not guilty to charges that he accepted bribes and illegal campaign contributions from Turkish nationals and government officials and carried out favors in exchange.\\nHochul has acknowledged reporting that she has privately directed Adams to clean house, and called the resignation of Adams adviser Timothy Pearson on Monday a 'good first step.'\\n'We expect changes. That's not a secret,' Hochul said at a Midtown press conference Wednesday.\\nAdams' administration has been embroiled in escalating federal investigations since the beginning of September, when multiple top aides to the mayor, including David Banks, his fiancee Sheena Wright, who is rumored to be stepping down, and his brother Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Phil Banks, were raided or subpoenaed by the feds. A third Banks brother, Terence Banks, who works as a government relations consultant, was also raided.\",\n",

Authorities are now seeking the public's help in identifying their exact locations.\\nFootage found in the camera suggests the teen filmed approximately 35 women, including four minors, as well as 'a male and woman in the restroom together engaging in sexual acts,' NJ.com reported, citing the criminal complaint.\\nCardenas is scheduled to appear in court on Oct. 22.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"To stop school shootings, put an eye in the sky\\nBrooklyn: According to the Washington Post, since the Columbine High School massacre on April 20, 1999, when two 12th-grade students murdered 12 students and one teacher, there have been 417 school shootings.\\nYet, there is something that can be done to better deal with school shootings: deploying drones. They are low-cost, easily maneuverable, flexible and stable. They have greatly improved response efficiency in surveillance, rescue operations, etc. by disaster management, environmental, infrastructure, law enforcement and military professionals.\\nA drone can be programmed to recognize when a backpack or other student carry-on contains guns and ammunition. Skilled pilots stationed at dedicated school areas can hover drones several hundred feet above a school site to flag renegade carry-ons and alert security, who will then notify the principal and other staff of the situation. Subsequently, all students with their carry-ons will go through a screening process, and once the suspect has been identified, the school can have the relevant parties and law authorities come to the scene to address the issue.\\nSome people have complained that drone usage violates the First and Fourth Amendments; various administrative laws do not permit their widespread use. However, the severity of the school shooting situation in this country has resulted in costly lawsuits and caused staff and students who witnessed the shootings to develop traumatic stress symptoms, chronic psychiatric disorders and other impairments that impact academic achievement and social and emotional growth. Therefore, the laws should be amended with critical vigor to allow for drone usage in schools. Vasilios Vasilounis\\nCommentary critique\\nBrooklyn: I watched a true debate. The moderators were professional and kept everything on track, not losing control of the situation, and being impartial for the most part. However, the discussions by commentators afterwards (and I switched back and forth through channels) appeared biased. Their tone and remarks seemed meant to sway voters to one side over the other. I thought it was their job to be neutral. L. Veneroni\\nIn sheep's clothing\\nManhattan: While watching the VP debate, it became clear to me that this man (JD Vance) is the classic wolf — intelligent and cunning, he had all the right answers on the debate stage. Too bad that those answers only applied to the debate and not to his actual, well-exposed political beliefs. A dangerous man hiding in the flock, or on the road to grandma's house. Don Cerrone\\n'The Boss' has spoken\\nSwarthmore, Pa.: Bruce Springsteen, perhaps the most famous and iconic American singer of all time, has come out with a full-throated endorsement of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Will it make any difference? That's hard to know. But Bruce, the man often called 'The Boss,' is an inspiring hero to millions of white, older men (like me). Arguably, there's no musician, or few people anywhere, who's viewed as more authentic and down-to-earth as Springsteen is. Even more than the endorsement Harris received from Taylor Swift, Springsteen's endorsement just might, at least subconsciously, move some voters toward her. In a race where the margin of victory is expected to be incredibly, even historically, small, Bruce's words could make a difference. Ken Derow\\nStay above the fray\\nSt. James, L.I.: I've noticed an increase in vituperative personal attacks between Voicers who maintain differing views on the presidential candidates and their respective parties. This should cease immediately, for it is disrespectful to our American values and history. The Founding Fathers designed the Constitution with the belief that the free exchange of opinions, without the fear of government reprisals and societal oppression, was the cornerstone of a democratic society where all citizens could participate. The constitutional freedoms of speech, press and assembly were designed to protect the minority opinion against the perilous oppression of the majority. The words of the 18th century philosopher Voltaire's biographer, Evelyn Beatrice Hall, were never more appropriate: 'I may not agree with what you have to say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.' We can disagree, debate and argue, but it should be done in a respectful manner. Carmine E. Esposito\\nUnited against the union\\nEdgewater, N.J.: Is anyone else enjoying watching the conservatives on TV twisting themselves into knots over the dockworkers and their demands for a fair share of the crazy profits they are helping to bring their foreign-based employers? The networks that pretend to represent the working man (working woman not so much — unless, of course, she's a Trump-styled babe) while surreptitiously promoting tax cuts for billionaires to be paid for by middle-class voters appear very concerned that the gains the dockworkers were able to obtain over the last few days will ruin the economy by causing inflation for the rest of us. And they seem rather dispirited that the quick settlement of the strike doesn't embarrass our president and vice president enough. So, whose side are they on? Jay K. Egelberg\\nUnderstocked\\nStaten Island: I recently went food shopping at the Stop & Shop here. I just happened to go the day after the longshoremen's/dock workers strike went into effect. Yet, you'd be shocked by what I saw. Many of the shelves there were empty of the most-purchased items, such as milk, toilet paper, paper towels, etc. In other words, the high-demand items. Surprised? Not me. I have no doubt that Stop & Shop was holding back items for sale just to be able to raise the prices on the name brands of these items. This is typical of them. They could have never sold out of these items in one day after the strike went into effect. Anyone who tells you differently is full of it. Dennis Pascale\\nUnfamiliar faces\\nStaten Island: Why are we allowing all these ugly protesters waving their flags and screaming? Go back to your country, please. You are making America ugly. America was always 'the beautiful.' American flags should be the only ones allowed to fly, no foreign ones! Fran Bocignone\\nReach within\\nManhattan: Joshua Stanton's essay (' We can't circle the wagons this Rosh Hashanah,' op-ed, Oct. 2) rightfully exposes discrimination and its toll on Jews throughout the world. He beseeches all to reach out to other communities throughout the world. However, he buries one throwaway line in the middle of his essay: 'While the circumstances into which we have been cast are not of our making…' — ah, there's the rub! Stanton can reach out to anyone anywhere and he will never make even a trivial dent in the problem until he accepts the fact that sometimes, Jews contribute to their own problems. There weren't too many antisemitic demonstrations the day after Hamas invaded Israel. Two months later, after Israel barbarically decimated half of Gaza, on their way to 95% destruction, world opinion changed. Israel's systematic pummeling of Gaza was a choice. Being persecuted only takes you so far. Accepting reality can take you further. Steven Davies\\nHeight of victory\\nManhattan: Gotta feel for the way the losers lost on Thursday (' Beer goggles! ' Oct. 4) — and for good baseball fans in a small market (although I grew up in a Yankees household where that sort of empathy was unknown). My husband and two of three sons root for the Mets, so they know the feeling. That allows them to acknowledge the irony that, had the Brewers not come back from a 0-8 deficit against the D'backs nearly a fortnight earlier to win 10-9, the Mets would have missed the wild card round. For a sport with quantifiable batting failure three-fourths of the time, the incidence of high drama is almost magical! Michele P. Brown\\nUber-burdened\\nRochdale Village: Kudos to retired NYPD commanding officer of the Traffic Control Division, James F. McShane (' Congestion pricing is not the (complete) answer,' op-ed, Oct. 3). Finally, an op-ed on traffic that considers the automobile. Mayor Mike Bloomberg started the bike lanes and parking in the second lane, but Mayor Bill de Blasio did the most egregious action, in my view. While the number of yellow cabs was fixed at 11,787 from 1937 until 1996 and has been capped at 13,587 since 2018, de Blasio allowed Uber and Lyft to put 75,000 cars on the road! And one guess where they all make beelines for! The Financial District, of course! Something should be done! And I have 25 years of yellow cab owner-driver experience. Saul Rothenberg\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"The Brooklyn DA's Conviction Review Unit exonerated its 40th defendant, a murder suspect so desperate to avoid returning to prison for a crime he did not commit that he accepted a plea deal that kept him out of jail.\\nKeith Roberts, 67, spent eight years in prison for murder before accepting a plea deal in 1995 to a lower charge so he could stay out of jail after his original conviction was reversed on appeal.\\nOn the eve of Roberts' second trial, he pleaded guilty to a manslaughter charge, which resulted in a maximum sentence of seven years, which was less than the time he had already served.\\nThe decision kept Roberts from the risk of another trial that could have landed him back in jail.\\nBut a Conviction Review Unit investigation years later determined that Roberts never should have gone to prison in the first place, and that he was the victim of unreliable testimony, overlooked evidence and a rushed investigation.\\n'Let's be clear. This should have never happened,' said Brooklyn DA Eric Gonzalez. 'It was a tragedy of justice, and I am grateful that today, my office, many years later, has been able to give him back his good name. It was important for his children. It was incredibly meaningful for them today to hear the evidence in court.'\\nThe flawed conviction stemmed from a fatal shooting outside an East Flatbush social club in 1986. Cops said a gunman shot Pierre Sanon, 33, after a dispute inside the Holiday Social Club spilled outside.\\nA witness led cops to a 'yellow house' to which Roberts allegedly fled — which, in fact, was where Roberts lived. Roberts told the officers who questioned him that he was at another party that night. However, he agreed to go to a local police precinct and appear in a lineup. The witness — the only one who placed Roberts at the scene — picked him out of the lineup, and Roberts was arrested.\\nThe case was closed just 12 hours after Sanon was killed.\\nRoberts was later convicted and sentenced to 18 years to life in prison.\\nAn appellate court later ruled that Roberts' alibi was 'plausible,' and that the eyewitness testimony was 'exaggerated and incongruent.'\\nEven though the court overturned his conviction, in the eyes of the law he was still guilty of something. Roberts said he wanted to clear his name. He appealed to the Conviction Review Unit for help.\\n'I promised my mother before she died that I would continue to fight to establish my innocence and honor her fight and sacrifice to free me and clear my name,' he said in a statement.\\nAs his three adult children watched from the gallery, Roberts offered a subdued thank you to the court, his supportive family and to the prosecutors, particularly Emily Harper at the Conviction Review Unit.\\n'I thank the courts for correcting a mistake that was made,' he said.\\nRoberts' lawyer, Leonard Noisette, said Roberts was looking forward to moving on with his life without the stain of a criminal conviction.\\n'Mr. Roberts is looking to living his life now, again, without the albatross of a wrongful conviction hanging around his neck and staining his reputation.' Noisette said. 'This should never have happened. This is justice delayed. This is justice long ovedue.'\\nOriginally Published: October 3, 2024 at 2:17 p.m.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Shannon Amos, the daughter of actor John Amos, said she learned of her father's death when it was reported in the media.\\nThe death of Amos, 84, was announced by son Kelly Christopher 'K.C.' Amos on Oct. 1. However, the 'Coming to America' actor had died of natural causes on Aug. 21.\\nShannon Amos, 58, responded to the news on Instagram.\\n'We are devastated and left with many questions about how this happened 45 days ago, learning about it through the media like so many of you,' she captioned a post featuring pictures and videos of the two together, including one where they dance outdoors.\\n'This should be a time of honoring and celebrating his life, yet we are struggling to navigate the wave of emotions and uncertainties surrounding his passing,' she continued. 'Still, there is some semblance of peace in knowing my father is finally free.'\\nShannon Amos claimed her father was a victim of elder abuse in June 2023 after he had been hospitalized in Memphis, Tenn. The alleged 'elder abuse, neglect, and fiduciary abuse' were 'believed to be perpetrated by a trusted caregiver,' she said. An investigation was opened by authorities in Colorado, but no other information was made available.\\nThe 'Good Times' star refuted those claims, which eventually pinned blame on K.C. Amos, most recently in March 2024.\\n'I want to first say that I am feeling well and working diligently on various projects that I am involved in at this time, including the docuseries that my son and I are producing, along with a music release,' Amos said in a statement to People magazine. 'I'd like to add that everywhere we go together, people refer to my son K.C. as my twin. I'm proud of him for who he is as a person: a caring, thoughtful human being who respects me and I him.'\\n'Now, I will say this for now: This story about neglect is false and unmerited,' he said. 'The real truth will come out soon and you will hear it from me. Believe it.'\\nShannon Amos responded, saying the seriousness of the matter was being 'downplayed.'\\n'We went through this before with my Mother, who also suffered tremendous neglect,' she told People. 'We are trying to prevent the same thing from happening to my Father. I love my brother and I hope he will get the help he needs, but we need to prioritize the safety of my father who is vulnerable, first and foremost.'\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Students from at least a dozen college campuses across the city are planning a walkout Monday as the city braces for a day of protests on the anniversary of the Israel-Gaza war.\\nThe protests are set to come on the anniversary of Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 surprise attack on Israel, which killed more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli official figures. Hamas took 251 hostages back to Gaza, and a year later, some 64 are still detained, while 117 have been freed and 70 confirmed dead.\\nIsrael, in turn, launched an invasion that has since resulted in the deaths of more than 40,000 Palestinians in Gaza, more than half of whom were women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.\\nOn Monday, students involved in the walkout plan to head to Washington Square Park before joining a larger citywide protest organized by the pro-Palestinian group Within Our Lifetime.\\nOn Friday, a CUNY spokesperson said in a statement that school officials are working closely with law enforcement and others in government 'to safeguard our students' right to a safe learning environment.'\\n'The university has also deployed additional private officers to campuses to provide support and issue guidance on demonstrations to college presidents and deans ahead of Oct. 7,' the statement reads. 'CUNY has strict policies in place to protect all our community members and expects students to exercise their right to express themselves responsibly and respectfully.'\\nColumbia University students, flyers show, are planning to leave class a few hours before the main protest for the steps of Low Library. The Morningside Heights campus remains closed to the public and accessible only to ID holders and pre-authorized guests.\\n'I appreciate that, across our diverse community, individuals and groups have had very different experiences over the past year. The terror attack on Oct. 7 and the ensuing war have affected us all, some more personally and more intensely than others,' Columbia's interim president, Katrina Armstrong, wrote in an Oct. 1 announcement. 'We must all come together to provide the space for people to mourn and to provide the grace required for every one of us to live through this time in an atmosphere of respect and support.'\\nArmstrong replaces former university president Minouche Shafik, who resigned after coming under fire for her handling of several weeks of tense pro-Palestinian protests this spring.\\nIn April, Shafik summoned the NYPD to clear an encampment that she said posed a safety risk, sparking a national wave of antiwar college protests. When a smaller group of protesters who returned to the lawns occupied Hamilton Hall, she again called the police to break up the protests. Several protesters were injured and an officer accidentally discharged his firearm inside Hamilton Hall.\\nRepresentatives of NYU did not return a request for comment.\\nMayor Adams on Saturday called the anniversary of Oct. 7 'extremely significant' to the city, particularly its Jewish community.\\n'The largest Jewish population outside of Israel is here in New York,' he told he Daily News. 'We're going to make sure that people are able to acknowledge the pain of that day without any interference and making sure that those who want to peacefully protest, they can do so peacefully. We are not going to tolerate violence or acts of disruptive destruction of property.'\\n'It's a very painful day for not only for Jewish New Yorkers but all New Yorkers that witnessed what happened,' he added. 'I said over and over again, Hamas must be destroyed, every hostage must be returned home, and we should bring peace in that region so that innocent children and families are not hurt.'\\nAs the anniversary approaches, and in the wake of Tuesday's missile attack on Israel by Iran, NYPD cops added additional cameras at key locations around New York City and brought 21 recently graduated K-9 dogs to check sensitive locations daily, NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence and Counterterrorism Rebecca Weiner said last week.\\nCops say they have heard of no specific threats against New York City so far in light of the Oct. 7 anniversary. But last month a 20-year-old man was stopped at the Canadian border and accused of planning to carry out a mass shooting at a Brooklyn Jewish center.\\nOver the next few weeks, city residents are expected to see more heavily armed 'Hercules' teams of the NYPD Emergency Service Unit and uniformed officers in marked police vehicles at Jewish institutions, synagogues and foreign consulates along with busy public places like Times Square and Central Park, NYPD officials said last week.\\nAt the same time, the NYPD Intelligence Bureau plans to stay in contact with its overseas liaisons, getting real-time information on the conflict in the Middle East and reviewing chatter on social media for possible terrorist attacks.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"After waiting 713 days for playoff baseball to return to the Bronx, a restless crowd filled the seats inside Yankee Stadium on Saturday night.\\nLong before Gerrit Cole threw the first pitch of the ALDS, Yankees fans booed the visiting Royals, roared for Juan Soto's pinstriped postseason debut, and thunderously declared Aaron Judge 'MVP.' With the building buzzing prior to the action, Kansas City found itself in hostile territory.\\nThe stars did not deliver the crucial blow, though, as Alex Verdugo's seventh-inning, opposite-field single scored Jazz Chisholm Jr. and gave the Yankees the go-ahead run in a 6-5 win. Earlier in the day, Aaron Boone said it was a 'fairly' easy call to start the embattled hitter in left field over Jasson Domínguez, a lively debate surrounding the Yankees for weeks given both players' shortcomings.\\nALEX VERDUGO SINGLE FOR THE LEAD!!! pic.twitter.com/3NdJPyJq57\\n— Talkin' Yanks (@TalkinYanks) October 6, 2024\\nWith Verdugo tested in the playoffs and a superior defender, Boone went with the veteran. But those weren't the only reasons Verdugo got the nod.\\n'As well as he's played in left, just felt like it was the right thing to do,' Boone said, 'and I still feel like he's got a good run of offense in him too.'\\nThe comment proved prophetic, as Verdugo went 2-for-3 with a walk and two runs scored. He also stopped the Royals from tacking on to a two-run frame when he made a sliding catch near the left field foul line in the fourth inning.\\nGerrit Cole, who allowed a two-run homer to MJ Melendez earlier in the inning, benefitted from that web gem. The ace allowed three earned runs over five innings of work.\\nCole hardly looked his best, allowing 11 hard-hit balls while walking two and striking out three.\\nBack on offense, Gleyber Torres made up for running into a first-inning out at the plate when he lofted a two-run homer off Michael Wacha in the third inning. That put the Yankees up one after Tommy Pham got the Royals on the board with a second-inning sac fly.\\nThe Yankees tied the game and took the lead in the bottom of the fifth when Austin Wells and Anthony Volpe worked walks with the bases loaded.\\nVolpe then set Kansas City's Garrett Hampson up for a two-run, go-ahead single when the shortstop made a throwing error in the sixth inning. However, Wells tied the game at five with a single in the bottom of the inning.\\nVerdugo, often a target for Yankees fans this season, then gave the Bombers the lead for good before Luke Weaver notched a four-out save.\\nWhile the Yankees stranded 11 runners — Giancarlo Stanton's lack of speed burned them twice — and went 2-for-13 with runners in scoring position, the lineup did just enough to start the 2024 postseason with a win.\\nNow the Yankees will look to take a 2-0 series lead with Carlos Rodón on the mound for Game 2 on Monday. He struck out nine Royals while permitting four runs (2 earned) over six innings on Sept. 9.\",\n",

It ended really ugly,' Sarah Ann said. 'It's important to note that Jeramey and I fought really really hard for our relationship. We wanted it to work. It gets to a point where you have to take a step back and realize that some things are just not meant to be.'\\nShe explained that things were 'pretty normal, chill' prior to filming the Netflix hit's reunion in February, to which Jeramey 'did not want to go.'\\nBut after the reunion — where the pair caught heat for how their connection was handled — 's–t got real' for the reality personalities, who by then 'were not getting along.' Sarah Ann attributed the sea change to 'a lot of the pressure and a lot of the things being said about us on the internet.'\\nThis led to 'a lot of resentment on both sides,' she said, adding that the couple was 'handling it and navigating it in the best way we knew how.'\\n'When you're alone in that with your partner … and they're the only person you have, it's easy to start to blame them,' she said, but insisted the breakup was 'in no way one person's fault.'\\nShe did, however, place some of the blame on 'the hatred and the social media,' which she said impacted their relationship 'greatly.'\\nSarah Ann and Jeramey hit it off in the 'Love Is Blind' pods, but it was Laura Dadisman to whom he ultimately proposed. Their short-lived engagement was upended when Laura accused Jeramey of stepping out on her with Sarah Ann, a claim the latter two denied.\\nSarah Ann and Jeramey were promptly ousted by their 'pod squad' and revealed at the reunion they were living together, further infuriating castmates and viewers alike.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Amid reports that Cheryl Hines and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. 'have barely spoken' in the weeks since news broke of an alleged affair involving him and a much younger political reporter, sources are now saying the rumored relationship is not the central focus of the couple's problems.\\nAccording to an insider who spoke to Us Weekly, Hines has been far more upset about the former presidential candidate ending his bid for the White House and giving his endorsement to Donald Trump.\\nThe 'Curb Your Enthusiasm' star, 59, is said to be concerned about how her husband's support of Republican Trump could impact her career.\\n' Cheryl wasn't so upset about the alleged affair, but more about how her husband's involvement with Trump will affect her in Hollywood,' the insider told the outlet, adding that Kennedy's 'political outspokenness has garnered a lot of polarizing attention.'\\n'She's worried that it will hinder her work opportunities, given her long career,' they said.\\nImmediately after dropping out of the race in August, 70-year-old Kennedy — a known conspiracy theorist and anti-vaccine advocate — confirmed his wife of 10 years was 'very uncomfortable' with his political decision.\\nHines is a 'lifelong Democrat' who 'does not support Donald Trump,' Kennedy said days later in an interview with TMZ.\\nWatching her husband stand behind the convicted 'Apprentice' star is 'something that she would have never imagined, that she never wanted in her life,' he said.\\nAmid the couple's issues over politics, Kennedy has also been plagued by accusations he's had affairs with multiple women.\\nOn Sept. 20, New York magazine announced in a note to its readers that political correspondent Olivia Nuzzi had been put on leave after having 'acknowledged to the magazine's editors that she had engaged in a personal relationship with a former subject relevant to the 2024 campaign while she was reporting on the campaign, a violation of the magazine's standards around conflicts of interest and disclosures.'\\nThe relationship allegedly began shortly after 31-year-old Nuzzi interviewed RFK for a New York profile published in November 2023. While Nuzzi later told CNN the relationship was 'never physical,' subsequent reports claimed the romance included sexting.\\nOn Wednesday, Mediaite reported that three more women linked to Kennedy's anti-vaccine organization claimed they too had affairs with the polarizing politician within the past year.\\nKennedy has denied all the allegations of cheating.\\n'Mr. Kennedy has had no romantic relationships with any woman other than his wife since their marriage,' a spokesperson said in a statement to Mediaite.\\nHines, meanwhile, has not publicly commented on the matter, though rumors have swirled she's been considering divorce. She was spotted celebrating a birthday in Spain without her husband or her wedding ring shortly after the scandal broke.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Make it right with Rose, but not before Jackson\\nCibolo, Texas: The recent death of Pete Rose has triggered a significant number of baseball fans to suggest that Rose's expulsion was excessive and he should be reinstated and enshrined at Cooperstown. In my opinion, although deserving, Rose needs to wait a bit longer.\\nJoseph Jefferson Jackson — 'Shoeless Joe' — represents the epitome of ballplayers who have been unjustly banished from the sport. The conspiracy to throw the 1919 World Series, the notorious Black Sox Scandal, is one of baseball's darkest moments. However, the debarment of Jackson for his 'involvement' in the fix remains a controversial topic.\\nIt is now well-known that Shoeless Joe (photo) refused the $5,000 bribe on two occasions. Additionally, Jackson attempted to inform Charles Comiskey, owner of the White Sox, about the fix. However, Comiskey declined to meet with Jackson. Years later, players who were implicated in the scandal admitted that Jackson did not actively participate in the fix. His performance during the 1919 World Series lends credence to his innocence. He was 12 for 32 (a .375 batting average) and five for 12 with runners in scoring position. Jackson hit the series' lone home run, and he is credited with six runs batted in.\\nUnfortunately, like Rose, Jackson remains on MLB's ineligible list, which precludes his election to the Hall of Fame. So far, efforts to reinstate him have been futile. It is time for MLB to correct this egregious error. Sorry, Pete, but Shoeless Joe goes to the front of the line. John Di Genio\\nA-list only?\\nPoint Pleasant, N.J.: So, I guess you have to be a super-celebrity to get your obituary in the Daily News. I notice that famous people have passed and The News no longer writes about their deaths. Damn shame. Gene Speroni\\nNeglected sport\\nCroton-on-Hudson, N.Y.: You do know the hockey preseason has opened, too? You cover the NBA but not the NHL. It's time for The News to expand its horizons. Let's go Rangers. Glenn E. Simpson\\nCheaters blanked\\nBronx: The Astros didn't advance this year because they couldn't cheat. Everyone was watching! Kevin Quirke\\nOff the air\\nPoyntelle, Pa.: Living here in northeastern Pennsylvania all my life, I was so shocked to hear the news that WCBS News Radio 880 was going off and changing to all-sports radio. I've been listening since 1990 — 34 years — and now I won't be able to hear Wayne Cabot and Paul Murnane, two of my favorite newsmen, and also Craig Allen, my favorite weatherman. The same thing happened in 1982, when WABC 770 dropped the music and went to all-talk radio. Let's hope News Radio 880 can get enough people angry to get sports taken off. Alan Kulakosky\\nInvesting instead\\nBronx: I know what I'm going to do if congestion pricing is approved in its present money-grabbing form. I will not drive into Manhattan and will save my congestion-price money to purchase the MTA tax-free bonds the agency will peddle once they reach the $1 billion collected from the poor souls who have to drive and spend money in Manhattan. Virgilio Carballo\\nTake a fuller view\\nWoodside: I agree with James F. McShane on his Be Our Guest piece (' Congestion pricing is not the (complete) answer,' op-ed, Oct. 3). Most of our congestion has been created by the city reengineering the streets in the central business district. This seems to have been done by the city mainly to kowtow to groups like Transportation Alternatives. It appears that no real thought went into this reengineering, looking at the pros and cons of these changes and the effects they would have on traffic patterns. Never taken into consideration was that double-parking runs rampant and unchecked, causing even more delays and congestion, especially on the cross streets. The city needs to rethink how these reengineering projects get done and look at the pros and cons and how they affect everyone — driver, pedestrian, cyclist. Tom Rice\\nDoubtful\\nBrooklyn: I have a different opinion in regards to the proposed Arrow Linen site in Windsor Terrace (' An Arrow pointing to housing,' editorial, Sept. 14). It will not only ruin that part of Prospect Ave., but it will start the decline of Windsor Terrace. Will the developer include parking for every apartment? I doubt that minimum-wage earners will be able to afford to live there. If the developer gets permission, they will build as much and as high as they can. This isn't about affordability, it's about greed. If you think I'm wrong, take a good look at Downtown Brooklyn, Carroll Gardens and Fourth Ave. Bruce Selfridge\\nHung out to dry\\nBronx: Re 'Frustration in wake of 'cane' (Oct. 3): Hundreds of thousands of people are desperately turning to the U.S. federal government for help. Meals of any kind, cultural sensitivity not important. Lodging of any kind, four-star ratings not necessary. Financial assistance as well as life-saving medical aid. Unfortunately for these people, they are only United States citizens fighting for their survival due to a national weather catastrophe in their very own country. Joe Schulok\\nDeprioritized\\nCortlandt Manor, N.Y.: Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas just announced that FEMA does not have enough funding to make it through hurricane season. This in spite of the Biden administration having just given another $2.4 billion to Ukraine and having also spent almost $1 billion in shelter services funding migrant housing over the last couple of years. This is a catastrophic neglect of duty on their part, as they continue to put Americans last. Interesting too is how the most needy Americans affected by Hurricane Helene are in areas that traditionally vote Republican, and the lack of aid and assistance may jeopardize their ability to vote next month. Michael P. Devine\\nSlick stuff\\nBrooklyn: At least the VP debate was civilized. There were no nasty comments. However, the following was clear: Sen. JD Vance was glib but a real empty suit. Either he lied or does not believe obvious facts. He refused to answer the question whether President Biden won the 2020 election. Vance lied that Donald Trump saved Obamacare. Trump made numerous unsuccessful attempts to abolish it. Vance also refused to answer the question about the lies spread by him and Trump concerning the Haitian residents of Springfield, Ohio. Vance still defends the lie. No matter how glib he is, unfortunately, he can't be trusted to tell the truth. Alan Podhaizer\\nHigh hypocrisy\\nStaten Island: To Voicer Fred Schoeneborn: It never fails to amuse me when a MAGA hat complains that someone from the other side is making up silly names for your idol. Webster's Dictionary defines hypocrisy as 'the practice of claiming to have moral standards or beliefs to which one's own behavior does not conform.' What's next? Are you going to complain about someone poking fun at disabled reporters? Or someone who calls veterans losers and suckers? You can't hold anyone to a higher standard than you hold yourself to. Victor R. Stanwick\\nPolarized policies\\nBronx: Letting states decide laws in opposition to the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause is unconstitutional. Remember when states legalized slavery for 200 years resulting in the Civil War, a war that killed more Americans than WWI and WWII combined. Presently, some states have the death penalty and others do not. Just imagine all the innocent people executed wrongly. How do you remedy that? This the ultimate misapplication of the 14th Amendment. Dare not touch the Second Amendment. Letting the states decide is a recipe for a discontented nation. We are living in the most polarized time in American history. A nation divided against itself can not long endure. We have met the enemy, it's us! Gilbert M. Lane\\nKeep printing\\nFloral Park: I am 83 and have been a New Yorker all my life. I want to thank you so much for your daily publication of The News. My family always had the newspapers delivered, but many of the New York papers have closed down. Thank you for your unbiased news and for the Voice of the People. Like many others, I enjoy doing the puzzles, along with the comics. Please keep printing, as your paper is a daily staple for many old and young readers. Pat Ryan\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Defeating the two-time defending champions was never going to be an easy task.\\nBut no one — maybe even the Aces — expected the Liberty to look as bad as they did on Friday night at Michelob Ultra Arena.\\nA disastrous third quarter derailed any chance of a Liberty sweep against the Aces in the semifinal round.\\nThe Liberty's three-point halftime deficit stretched to eight in the third at the 6:52 mark. Las Vegas' issues from the first two games were nonexistent. The pick-and-roll defense was better, Becky Hammon didn't have to watch her team miss countless layups and the lethal Jonquel Jones – Sabrina Ionescu tandem looked nothing like it.\\nIonescu didn't make a field goal till the fourth quarter when she knocked down a trey with eight minutes left in regulation in Friday's 95-81 Game 3 beatdown in Las Vegas. She was mostly ineffective while clearly being minimized due to more pressure directed from Hammon. Ionescu missed six of her seven shots while recording four points, five assists, five rebounds and five turnovers.\\nThe Aces adjusted. And they survived to keep their chances of a three-peat alive. Game 4 is now set for Sunday in Las Vegas.\\nHammon's team departed from the East Coast and quickly flipped a switch.\\nThey were no longer getting beat in transition. And on a chance the Liberty did get on the break, Jones received a pas from Ionescu, but the big crashed into Chelsea Gray, who was in position to draw an offensive foul. It was Jones' fourth foul and it forced head coach Sandy Brondello to send the important Liberty center to the bench once again due too foul trouble.\\nJones too finished with an unimpressive statline: 11 points, six rebounds and a turnover.\\nThe Liberty missed 12 straight shots in third, a stretch that spanned six and a half minutes. And frustrations boiled over with 90 seconds remaining in the period after Courtney Vandersloot appeared to get pushed by Kelsey Plum, but was called for a travel. Vandersloot yelled at the official, who then gifted her a technical foul.\\nIt capped a disastrous third quarter that the Liberty lost, 21-6. Las Vegas ended it on a 17-2 run. New York trailed by 18 going into the fourth and saw a deficit balloon to as many as 25 points.\\nThe rest of the fourth quarter felt like an exhibition with the Liberty had zero chance of dwindling the lead.\\nIronically, the Game 3 looked like an instant classic was brewing.\\nAs the Liberty adjusted to the early blitzes on Ionescu, the Aces went on a 7-0 run midway through the first period to go up four. They eventually led by three after Jackie Young's best start of the series: 10 points and two assists. She finished with a team-high 24 points, six rebounds and four assists.\\nMuch of the 2024 success of the Liberty relied on Jones staying out of foul trouble, an issue that occurred at multiple times in the regular season. The issue appeared again with four minutes remaining in the second quarter Friday after Jones whacked A'ja Wilson in the face for her third personal foul. The Liberty eventually lost those minutes, 14-9.\\nBut the Libs stayed in the game with Breanna Stewart draining her first five shots. She later cooled off and finished with a team-high 19 points on 7-of-17 shooting. She grabbed six boards and recorded a team-worst -24 in 33 minutes of action.\\nThe first half featured a frantic pace, with elite shotmaking on both sides. While Ionescu failed to score (but dished five assists), Stewart and Betnijah Laney-Hamilton traded jumpers. But Wilson, Plum and Young responsed on the other end. WIlson, Plum and Young combined for 35 of the 52 Aces' first-half points.\\nBy halftime, the game featured 18 lead changes (most in WNBA playoff history) and eight ties. No team led by more than five points in the first half.\\nThen the game exploded in the third with Brondello later waving the white flag with three minutes remaining in regulation.\\nUltimately, Game 3 was a puzzling, poor loss from a Liberty squad that went 5-0 against the Aces (in the regular season and postseason) before Friday's shellacking. They'll have a chance to make things right in a potential elimination Game 4 on Sunday.\",\n",

Tweedly allegedly told police Stilwell came to his Bay City home on the night of Sept. 14.\\nWhen Stilwell didn't want to stay, Tweedly told detectives he pushed the victim down his basement stairs and later strangled him to death.\\nStilwell's body was too heavy to move, so Tweedly allegedly went to a nearby Walmart to buy an ax and bags.

       "   'summary': \"The fatwa authorities believe motivated a New Jersey man to violently attack author Salman Rushdie in 2022, leaving him blind in one eye, is not expected to be a factor in his upcoming trial in western New York.\\n' We're not going there,' Chautauqua County District Attorney Jason Schmidt said Friday.\\nHe explained that jurors tasked with determining the fate of attacker Hadi Matar do not need to understand his motivation because the assault was witnessed and recorded by a live audience at the Chautauqua Institution, near Lake Erie.\\nRushdie was about to give a lecture there on the morning of Aug. 12, 2022, when 26-year-old Matar rushed the stage and stabbed him more than a dozen times, police said. He was quickly detained by New York State troopers working the event and subsequently charged with second-degree attempted murder and second-degree assault in connection with the stabbing.\\nMatar, a resident of Fairview, N.J. who holds dual citizenship in Lebanon, has also since been charged in a separate federal indictment with an act of terrorism transcending national boundaries, attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization and providing material support to terrorists.\\nThe counts stem from allegations that Matar was trying to fulfill a fatwa, or a religious decree calling for his Rushdie's death.\\nThe late Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued the directive in 1989, after Rushdie published 'The Satanic Verses.' He said the book, one of Rushdie's most popular works, was blasphemous and declared it an insult to Islam and Prophet Mohammed.\\nThe fatwa was enough to send the renowned author into hiding, where he remained for years before he finally reemerged in the late 1990s.\\nIn wake of the attack, Rushdie underwent a series of surgeries and was placed on a ventilator. He has since released a memoir detailing the incident titled 'Knife: Meditations After an Attempted Murder.'\\nHe's also expected to testify in Matar's trial, which is slated to begin with jury selection on Oct. 15 at Chautauqua County Court.\\nWhile jurors won't have to contend with Matar's motive, attorneys say they will face questions meant to root out implicit bias during the selection process.\\nDefense attorney Nathaniel Barone on Friday sought assurances that jurors in the state trial would be properly vetted, citing Matar's Lebanese roots and the fact that he practices Islam.\\n'We're concerned there may be prejudicial feelings in the community,' Barone said.\",\n",

He said that when he investigated, he found Brown dead in the living room and a 5-foot-9 heavyset Black man in a black hoodie running out of the apartment.\\nBrown died at the scene, cops said.\\nThe witness was found inside the apartment the next morning, sopping up Brown's blood from the floor.\\n'My uncle got killed last night,' said the friend, who wished not to be named. 'He's not like a blood relative but he's like an uncle. I knew him since I was a baby. Over 36 years I knew that man!'\\nThe man was cleaning up the blood to spare his family the horror of what happened.\\n'I'm not gonna let my family come and see that. It's not OK what happened, but you know…' he said solemnly before getting back to his grim task.\\nBrown has 42 arrests on his record and did four stints in prison in the '80s and '90s for weapon possession, attempted robbery and assault, according to court records. In at least five of the arrests, cops charged Brown with resisting arrest, police sources said.\\nWhen he wasn't sleeping on the couch inside the second-floor apartment, he could be found sleeping in the building's stairwell, neighbors said.\\nThe shooting may have begun with a struggle in the hallway at the foot of the stairs, one neighbor said.\\n'There was rumbling in the stairs,' the neighbor said. 'Somebody was struggling in the stairs. Somebody was saying, 'Get off of me! Get off of me!' I was like, 'I'm not gonna go outside to see what's going on.' And then after that, that's when I heard the shots.'\\nNeighbors didn't know why Brown's nickname was 'Homicide.' Out of his four prison stints, none were for murder.\\n'I asked him about it, once,' the neighbor said. 'He didn't tell me why.'\\nInstead, the woman said, 'He just smiled.'\\nBrown was addicted to drugs and smoked crack, but had just recently taken steps to kick his habit, longtime friends said.\\nOne friend said Brown had just returned after spending four months at an Upstate New York rehab facility before he was killed.\\n'He stopped doing drugs and look what happened to him,' said the 54-year-old pal, who wished not to be named. The friend, who had known Brown for more than two decades, said, 'He wanted to get clean. He was tired of it.'\\nAfter rehab, 'he seemed happy,' the friend said. 'He was more outgoing.'\\nBrown, another longtime friend said, 'didn't bother nobody unless you bothered him.'\\n'I couldn't believe it,' he said when he heard of Brown's death.\\nNo arrests have been made. It wasn't immediately clear what sparked the clash.\\nPolice on Friday were scouring the area looking for surveillance footage that could help them identify the gunman.\\nOriginally Published: October 4, 2024 at 2:31 p.m.\",\n",

       "   'excerpt': \"Prosecutors want to show the video recordings to jurors to bolster their argument Daniel Penny acted recklessly and disregarded signs he was putting Jordan Neely's life at risk.\",\n",
       "   'summary': \"Footage of Daniel Penny's statements to police after he placed Jordan Neely in a fatal chokehold aboard a subway car — in which he dismissively branded the victim a 'crackhead' — were shown in court Thursday.\\nThe videos, which Penny's defense wants prosecutors barred from showing the jury at his upcoming manslaughter trial, will not be released publicly unless Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Maxwell Wiley allows it in evidence. The judge is considering requests from both sides ahead of jury selection, scheduled for Oct. 21.\\nPenny, 25, a former Marine from Long Island, willingly sat for an interview with detectives from the Fifth Precinct after the May 1, 2023, chokehold incident that claimed the 30-year-old Neely's life. Penny waived his right to stay silent and have an attorney present, the footage shows.\\nHe said he got on a northbound F train at Jay St.-MetroTech in Brooklyn and that Neely boarded his car at the Second Ave. stop in the East Village in Manhattan. Penny said Neely threw a windbreaker jacket as the doors closed, and began to shout threateningly at passengers and something about 'ginger ale and Sprite.'\\nDescribing Neely as a 'crackhead,' Penny said the victim had his back to him when Penny 'just kind of got him in a hold' in an attempt to 'de-escalate' the situation.\\n'I get him down, he's squirming around and stuff,' Penny said. 'It seems like he's resisting.'\\nAsked several times about his method of restraint, Penny said he applied pressure when the subdued Neely got 'a little bit of energy,' motioning a chokehold to the two detectives.\\n'When he starts to squirm, I hold him tighter,' Penny said.\\nProsecutors want to show the recordings to jurors to bolster their argument that Penny acted recklessly and disregarded signs he was putting Neely's life at risk. They called to the stand Thursday the detectives who interviewed Penny and some officers who responded to the scene.\\nHowever, Penny's lawyer Thomas Kenniff argued that the precinct interview should be suppressed because Penny wasn't lawfully being detained, accusing authorities of manipulating him into believing he had to talk to them.\\nKenniff also opposed the inclusion of police-worn body camera footage of Penny's remarks to cops at the subway station, when he said, 'I had him pretty good. I was in the Marine Corps,' among other remarks.\\nThe defense played police bodycam footage of straphangers relating what they witnessed, which Kenniff said was recorded while cops had Penny 'on ice' back at the precinct. Two subway riders quoted Neely as saying he didn't care if he died and went to jail. One woman said Neely was 'terrifying the entire train.' Nobody said Neely touched any of the passengers.\\nProsecutors from Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's Office said it was 'clear' that Penny knew he was free to leave the scene, noting he was never handcuffed or patted down by cops. They also want to block defense lawyers from focusing on Neely's history of drug use and mental health issues, which they say is an attempt 'to smear the victim's character so that the jury will devalue his life.'\\nPenny has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide and could face significant prison time if convicted.\\nViral footage of the latter stages of the incident shows Penny with his arm tightly curled around Neely's neck and his legs wrapped around his body for some four minutes, briefly aided by two men, on the floor of the subway, as it was stopped at the Broadway-Lafayette St. station.\\nA writhing Neely eventually stops moving, the footage shows, while Penny continues gripping him in a chokehold. Neely was later pronounced dead at the hospital. The city Medical Examiner determined his cause of death was homicide, and Penny was arrested 11 days after the incident and indicted by a grand jury. He's currently out on a $100,000 bond.\\nThe delay between Neely's death and Penny's arrest prompted citywide protests over the unaccounted killing of a poor and unarmed Black man in broad daylight. Prominent Republicans rushed to Penny's defense, lauding him as a Good Samaritan and crowdfunding more than $3 million toward his defense.\\nBodycam footage played in court shows cops — who administered Narcan to Neely at the scene and attempted CPR — searching the unconscious man's pockets on the train car and finding a muffin.\\nThe victim, who grew up in Manhattan and New Jersey, was homeless and battled severe mental illness in his short life, according to his loved ones. His mother was brutally murdered when he was 14. In happier moments, he was familiar to many New Yorkers as a passionate street performer and Michael Jackson tribute artist who busked underground.\\nIn Penny's interview with detectives, he said he wasn't trying to injure Neely and that it wasn't how he was 'trained,' in reference to his military service.\\n'These guys are on the train all the time,' Penny said, but added that Neely seemed threatening. He quoted the victim as saying he was going to 'kill everybody,' but Penny later said he didn't know if those words were used or if Neely touched anyone.\",\n",

He regularly brags of appointing the three Supreme Court justices who engineered the overturning of the landmark Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide.\\nAfter first saying he opposes Florida's draconian ban on abortion after six weeks of pregnancy, Trump now says he will vote against an abortion rights referendum that would bring back the protections of Roe v.

       "   'summary': \"Her husband has come under fire for enabling the erosion of reproductive rights, but former First Lady Melania Trump comes out in her upcoming memoir as a staunch supporter of abortion rights, according to a new report.\\n'It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government,' Melania Trump states in the book, according to The Guardian. 'Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman's fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes.'\\nThe memoir, 'Melania,' is due out a month before the presidential election. Her husband, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, arguably set the stage for the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022, ending women's federally constitutional right to choose an abortion. Trump has bragged about his role in the change while saying all he did was send the decision back to the states. Many states have since enacted bans.\\nMelania has always felt this way, according to her book, which seems set to upend norms for American first ladies yet again.\\n'Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body,' she wrote, according to The Guardian, which obtained an advance copy. 'I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.'\\nHer view stands in stark contrast to that of former President Donald Trump. Not only did he set the stage for the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade and deny a woman's right to choose abortion-related health care, he also has took credit for returning the decision to the states. Many states have since enacted abortion bans.\\nFor Melania Trump, as with many reproductive-rights advocates, it's a question of common sense. People must take care of themselves before anybody else, she writes, and are 'entitled to maintain a gratifying and dignified existence,' including a woman's 'natural right to make decisions about her own body and health.'\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Former President Donald Trump 'resorted to crimes' and bullied Mike Pence in the plot to overturn his loss in the 2020 election, Special Counsel Jack Smith charged in a new filing unsealed Wednesday in the federal Jan. 6 election interference case.\\nIn never-before-seen evidence, prosecutors detailed Trump's effort to cajole Pence into joining the illegal scheme to stay in power and his effort to incite his followers to attack the Capitol and block the certifications of President Biden's election when Pence refused.\\n'When the defendant lost the 2020 presidential election, he resorted to crimes to try to stay in office,' the prosecution wrote in the filing.\\nThe 165-page document amounts to Smith's argument that Trump's alleged misdeeds are not covered by the substantial presidential immunity granted by the Supreme Court. It was ordered unsealed Wednesday by District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan.\\nProsecutors said Trump acted in his private capacity as a presidential candidate, not in his official capacity as president, for which the top court said he could not be held criminally accountable.\\n'[Trump's] scheme was fundamentally a private one,' Smith's team said. 'He pursued multiple criminal means to disrupt, through fraud and deceit, the government function by which votes are collected and counted — a function in which the defendant, as president, had no official role.'\\nSome of the most evocative new evidence bared in the filing concerns Trump's effort to browbeat Pence.\\nAt a private lunch the two had on Nov. 12, 2020, Pence 'reiterated a face-saving option' for Trump, telling him, 'don't concede but recognize the process is over,' according to prosecutors.\\nIn another private lunch days later, Pence urged Trump to accept the results of the election and run again in 2024.\\n'I don't know, 2024 is so far off,' Trump told him, according to the filing.\\nAs the Jan. 6, 2021 certification date drew near, Trump ramped up efforts to bully Pence into bowing to his scheme to accept fake pro-Trump slates of electoral votes from some battleground states, a plot designed to throw Biden's election into doubt.\\nOn Jan. 6, Trump threatened to call out Pence to his violent extremist supporters if he did not cave.\\n'I'm going to have to say you did a great disservice,' Trump told Pence, according to the filing.\\nAfter delivering a fiery speech to supporters, Trump returned to the White House where he watched the violence at the Capitol unfold on TV.\\nHe alone wrote and sent a tweet deriding Pence as supporters hunted down his vice president, chanting 'Hang Mike Pence,' the filing charges.\\nThe filing quotes Trump as telling an aide 'So what?' when he was told Pence could be in danger after violent supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\\nA Trump spokesman derided the filing as part of a liberal witch hunt to tarnish Trump and prevent him from beating Democrat Kamala Harris and winning a return to the White House.\\nThe filing almost surely marks the last chance for the public to assess and discover previously unknown actions carried out by Trump before he faces the verdict of voters in the 2024 election.\\nTrump was hit with a new streamlined superseding indictment in the case after the Supreme Court ruling last summer.\\nBut any potential trial is many months away. Chutkan still needs to rule if the new charges meet the criteria laid down for determining presidential immunity. Her ruling would then likely be appealed back to the Supreme Court.\\nThe new documents also includes voluminous details of Trump's involvement in the state-by-state effort to convince Republican officials to create the bogus slates of alternate electors.\\nIt details the efforts of lieutenants believed to be Rudy Giuliani and ex-Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, although their names are blacked out in the filing.\\nTrump already faces sentencing after Election Day for his criminal conviction in the Manhattan hush money case in which he was convicted.\",\n",

The $80 million sought in the lawsuit will go towards medical costs, he added.\\n'There is no amount of money that can make up for the harm that Gregory has suffered — we can only hope to make his life more manageable by providing him with enough resources to take care of all of his medical needs,' his attorney Nick Liakas said in a statement.\\n'The NYPD caused irreparable harm to this innocent bystander and to avoid further tragedy, major policy changes must be considered, including eliminating the use of highly ineffective Tasers on civilians.'\\nA second subway rider, a 26-year-old woman, was also struck by a stray NYPD bullet during the shooting and suffered a minor injury.\\nOne of the two cops who opened fire was wounded by friendly fire from his partner and was listed in stable condition.\\nMickles was also shot and critically wounded. He has been charged with assault on a police officer and menacing.\\nThe drama unfolded about 3 p.m. when Mickles, who has a history of mental illness, walked through an open subway gate at the subway station, according to police. Mickles has about 20 prior arrests, including more than a dozen for burglary, plus one for a robbery and one for gun possession, police sources said.\\nTwo 73rd Precinct officers, assigned to the station on overtime as part of an effort to tamp down on subway crime, followed Mickles in a second encounter he had with them within 15 minutes.\\n'At a certain point on the platform, the male mutters the words 'You know I'm going to kill you if you don't stop following me,'' NYPD Chief of Department Jeffrey Maddrey said at a news conference held on the afternoon of the shooting. Officers Edmund Mays and Alex Wong caught up to Mickles and asked him to take his hands out of his pockets, Maddrey said.\\n'They become aware that he has a knife in his pocket,' the chief said.\\n'They give numerous commands,' Maddrey said. 'The male basically challenges the officers—'No, you're going to have to shoot me.''\\nThe fare beater was within seven feet of the cops — with his knife drawn — when they opened fire, officials said.\\nDelpeche's cousin Gregory Nougues said it was too soon to know how severe his brain damage will be.\\n'It's a waiting game now. It's just a waiting game,' said Nougues, who added that Delpeche has been able to move his arms and legs.\\nDelpeche worked as a clerical associate at Woodhull Medical Center, relatives said.\\nA notice of claim is a legal announcement filed if someone is planning to sue the city.

       "   'excerpt': 'FEMA has faced many obstacles in their relief efforts, among them rumors swirling in wake of the storm, one of them perpetuated by former President Trump.',\n",
       "   'summary': \"The Federal Emergency Management Agency urged storm-weary residents across the south — scores of them left without homes and hundreds of thousands more still without power — to verify and fact-check information regarding aid and relief efforts, warning the deluge of rumors and misinformation will only slow their recovery after Hurricane Helene's deadly rampage.\\nMore than 220 deaths across six states have been linked to the monstrous storm in the days since it made landfall on Florida's Gulf Coast as a Category 4 hurricane, making the storm the deadliest to strike the mainland U.S. since Hurricane Katrina in 2005.\\nWith windspeeds topping 140 mph at times, Helene tore through the Big Bend region, ripping apart homes in addition to toppling trees and powerlines. The storm also dumped huge amounts of rain on the Sunshine State, leaving roadways flooded and buildings submerged before taking aim at Georgia.\\nDespite weakening during its journey inland, Helene continued to wreak similar havoc across Tennessee and the Carolinas.\\nMore than a week later, southerners are still grappling with how to move forward.\\nAs of Saturday morning, more than 500,000 people — most of them in Georgia and the Carolinas — did not have electricity, according to PowerOutage.us. Others were left to contend with the loss of their homes while they cleared debris from their storm-ravaged properties.\\nSince Helene's arrival, FEMA has deployed more than 6,400 personnel across the south. The agency has also shipped more than 13.2 million meals, upwards of 13.4 million liters of water, more than 492,000 tarps and 157 generators to the hardest hit regions, especially the more mountainous and remote parts of North Carolina, FEMA said on Saturday.\\nThe agency has faced many obstacles in their response, chief among them the sheer scope of the damage, which spans 100 miles across multiple states.\\nFEMA, along with local and state officials, have also been working to battle back rumors swirling in wake of the storm, one of them perpetuated by former President Donald Trump. After Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas earlier this week said FEMA would not have enough funds to make it through hurricane season, Trump quickly seized on the claim.\\nHe suggested on Friday, without evidence, that ' a billion dollars was stolen from FEMA to use it for illegal migrants, many of whom are criminals, to come into our country, and FEMA is now busted.'\\nHe added: ' They have no money.'\\nThe world's richest man, Elon Musk, offered up his own claim, writing in a post on X that FEMA is 'actively blocking citizens who try to help.'\\nSenior deputy press secretary Andrew Bates disputed the allegations in a memo circulated to reporters on Friday.\\n'This is FALSE,' he wrote, per ABC News. 'No disaster relief funding at all was used to support migrants housing and services. None. At. All.'\\nFEMA has also launched a web page dedicated to pushing back on what it says are rumors and misinformation about the federal government's response.\\nThe American Red Cross earlier this week also rejected claims it was 'confiscating or throwing out donated items' and 'taking over' shelters and volunteer groups. It further noted that spreading misinformation 'disrupts our ability to deliver critical aid and affects the disaster workers who have put their own lives on hold to assist those in need.'\\nOriginally Published: October 5, 2024 at 11:44 a.m.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"General Daily Insight for October 07, 2024\\nSelf-care is a must. With today's only aspect as the sensitive Moon squaring critical Saturn at 10:50 pm EDT, trying to make things happen could be frustrating. We might worry that we're running in place while attempting to get somewhere, and connections with others may feel fruitless. It would be dangerously easy to let criticism, loneliness, or silence create hurt feelings, making it extra important to be kind when everyone's feeling the stress. Let's support one another rather than tear each other down.\\nAries\\nMarch 21 – April 19\\nProgress will probably be particularly difficult at this moment. You could feel like you are consistently entrapped in all sorts of delays, misdirections, and distractions, preventing you from getting to the destination you're seeking. Whether this destination is a literal place that you're traveling to or a more figurative project that you're trying to work on, be patient with yourself — and with the people around you. It might not be quick to get where you're going, so try to enjoy the journey.\\nTaurus\\nApril 20 – May 20\\nConnecting with others may be harder than you'd expect. You might get the sense that everyone is missing the meaning when you're speaking to other people, or it could be that you're playing phone tag because you can't get your schedules to line up. While this can be upsetting, try not to let it get to you. Remember that you'll have more opportunities to communicate in the future. Patiently waiting to say the right words at the right time is the key.\\nGemini\\nMay 21 – June 20\\nThe feedback you want may seem barely out of reach. You may have thought that you reached a new high for yourself when it comes to your work or expressing yourself in any way, but someone in your life, possibly a boss or a parent, could suddenly shoot down your enthusiasm. Their criticism doesn't mean that they're automatically right, but it would be beneficial to avoid getting defensive. Take in the information and do with it what you want, but hear them out first.\\nCancer\\nJune 21 – July 22\\nYou're doing more than running in place, Cancer — even if it doesn't feel like it. The habits that you've been building may not seem fruitful yet, but don't worry. Your consistent work on them is likely feeding progress that is happening underground, where you can't see it change every day. If you find yourself feeling unmotivated, consider creating a visual reminder of the work that you've done or the goal that you're aiming for, such as a photo album or vision board.\\nLeo\\nJuly 23 – August 22\\nYou might be impulsively silencing yourself for someone else's benefit. A peer's critique of how you conduct yourself may have led you to retreat from the spotlight — but are you doing this to please yourself or to please them? If you know that you're happy in the spotlight, and it's where you feel most at home, then one person's criticism shouldn't be enough to push you into the shadows! Speak your truth, even if it's not what everyone wants to hear.\\nVirgo\\nAugust 23 – September 22\\nConcerns about showing your heart to the people around you are normal, but you deserve better than that. You may be hung up on naysayers from your past, especially if they led you to feel less than confident about whatever you were or are bringing to the table. However, the people that you're around now should be supportive of you! They shouldn't try to tear you down just for expressing yourself. You're worth far more than merely what you can do for others.\\nLibra\\nSeptember 23 – October 22\\nPeople that were supposed to show up for you may not be consistent. You may have shown up for them in the past, but once it's time to return the favor, they're nowhere to be found. Make a point of contemplating their reasoning for why they couldn't be there. While there are situations in which it would be understandable that they couldn't show up for you, there are others that are not acceptable. Save your energy and time for those who want a mutual friendship.\\nScorpio\\nOctober 23 – November 21\\nReckless behavior can threaten solid foundations. Do your level best to avoid crossing the line with your friends for the moment, as well as with romantic relationships, because taking a big chance is unlikely to result in a positive outcome for you or the people around you. Be respectful with how you're conducting yourself and try to be aware of what may hurt their feelings. Even accidentally stepping on toes may result in the end of certain connections. Take a walk in their shoes.\\nSagittarius\\nNovember 22 – December 21\\nYou might feel like you're spinning your wheels. Even if you typically love discussing one topic or are working hard to try and learn something new, your head and your heart may just not be in it. The more that you try to force yourself to do something that you don't want to do, the more that you're likely to notice a lack of results. Your authenticity is one of your greatest assets at this time, so be honest with yourself.\\nCapricorn\\nDecember 22 – January 19\\nEven a crowded room can get lonely. When you're with a casual group, whether they're new acquaintances or old friends you haven't spoken to lately, you may feel immensely isolated. They may not grasp why you're not gelling with them, while you might not understand what's genuinely standing between you and a connection with this group. Their vibe may simply not be what you're looking for! If this is the case, it could be a good idea to start seeking out different connections.\\nAquarius\\nJanuary 20 – February 18\\nYour past might be getting in the way of your future. Decisions in your history are still affecting your current world — their far-reaching consequences may now be your responsibility or hinder your current work. Even if you can't fix things right away, the issue is likely something that you can work with in creative ways. Try not to see things in black and white, such as your prior actions preventing you from ever building your preferred future. There's always room for growth.\\nPisces\\nFebruary 19 – March 20\\nReceiving a lack of direction may hamper your progress. You might be seeking some information from an authority figure or mentor who isn't providing it, and when you seek it out more intently, they could end up just confusing or discouraging you with their answers. This is potentially a situation where you have to follow your own leadership, and although it can be uncertain, it's vital that you rise to the challenge. You're worth the effort of making yourself into a hero!\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"As Oswaldo Cabrera, Ben Rice and Jon Berti fielded groundballs at first base during the Yankees' first postseason workout on Oct. 1, Anthony Rizzo watched from the shallow infield grass with his hands in his hoodie pocket.\\nWith his right hand carrying two fractured fingers, the result of a hit-by-pitch on the second-to-last day of the regular season, Rizzo played the part of coach. As his teammates – all relatively inexperienced at first base – took reps at the position, the Gold Glover stopped them, chatted them up and offered pointers.\\nRizzo, unable to heal in time for the ALDS, has remained a presence around the team. He's been especially helpful to those working at his position.\\n'We are like the students, and he's like our Mr. Miyagi,' said Cabrera, who started Game 1 of the ALDS at first despite logging just 71.2 regular season innings there.\\n'Rizz has been helping out a bunch,' added Berti, who has not played first base outside of a few innings in a spring training game with the Marlins a few years ago. 'I'm just asking him a bunch of questions and learning as much as I can as quick as I can.'\\nBen Rice, Oswaldo Cabrera and Jon Berti are taking grounders at 1B while Anthony Rizzo coaches them up. #Yankees pic.twitter.com/l2PaBUlPw8\\n— Gary Phillips (@GaryHPhillips) October 1, 2024\\nRizzo's expertise has not been limited to first, either.\\n'He's been great,' said Rice, a fellow lefty swinger and natural catcher who is still finding his way at first. 'He's definitely been a mentor for me, not just defensively, but also offensively. Just talking to him about watching the game, watching at-bats, talking about pitchers, talking about game-planning, tendencies, all that stuff. So he's been an awesome teammate.'\\nWhile Rizzo's injury would normally require a 3-4-week timeline, the former World Series champ is hoping to join the Yankees for the ALCS should they advance. He started doing some baseball activities prior to the ALDS, but he found his capabilities to be substandard with two broken digits.\\nIn the meantime, Rizzo is downplaying the help he's been giving the Yankees' first base novices.\\n'I was just talking to them [about] bunt scenarios, different plays, pickoffs. I'm an open book,' Rizzo said. 'Everyone has each other's' backs.'\\nHowever, Cabrera, Rice and Berti are not the only ones who realize how useful Rizzo has been and can continue to be – even if he's stuck on the sidelines.\\n'So many guys look up to him in that room,' Aaron Boone said. 'I think [it] means a lot to those guys. And I'd like to think [that's] another piece in some of the value that he brings.'\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Mohamed Bahi, a staffer in Mayor Adams' community affairs unit who resigned Monday, has been indicted on federal charges alleging he destroyed evidence and tampered with witnesses in the ongoing corruption investigation into the mayor's Turkish government ties.\\nThe indictment, unsealed Tuesday by prosecutors from the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office, alleges Bahi this past June met with an unnamed businessman who's a donor to Adams and hosted a fundraiser for his first mayoral campaign in December 2020.\\nAs part of the fundraiser, four unidentified employees of the businessman's construction firm made illegal straw donations to the mayor's campaign, according to Bahi's indictment.\\nBut in June's meeting, Bahi instructed the businessman and his four employees to lie to federal investigators about the monetary source of their contributions to Adams.\\n'During the meeting between BAHI, the businessman, and the four donors, BAHI encouraged the donors to lie to federal investigators by denying that they had made straw donations to the 2021 [Adams] campaign, and remarked that because the donors' contributions to the 2021 [Adams] campaign had been reimbursed in cash, the FBI would be unable to prove that the reimbursements had occurred,' the indictment alleges.\\nThe feds also say Bahi committed a crime when FBI agents showed up at his home on July 24 to execute a search warrant and seize his electronics.\\nAccording to the indictment, Bahi deleted the encrypted messaging app Signal from his cellphone upon the feds' arrival. The indictment alleges the app had evidence on it pertinent to the Turkey investigation, including messages exchanged with the mayor.\\nBahi abruptly resigned from his City Hall job in the mayor's Community Affairs Unit on Monday.\\n'The charges unsealed today should leave no doubt about the seriousness of any effort to interfere with a federal investigation, particularly when undertaken by a government employee,' Manhattan U.S. Attorney Damian Williams, who's leading the Adams-Turkey investigation, said in a statement. 'Our commitment to uncovering the truth and following the facts wherever they may lead is unwavering.'\\nAdams was indicted as part of the same investigation last month on charges alleging he solicited and accepted bribes from Turkish government operatives in exchange for political favors. He has pleaded not guilty.\\nBahi was expected to be arraigned on the witness tampering and evidence destruction charges later Tuesday in Manhattan Federal Court.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"First Deputy Mayor Sheena Wright resigned Tuesday and is expected to be replaced by one of her top aides — the latest staff shakeup to rock Mayor Adams' administration amid his criminal indictment and continuing fallout from federal corruption probes besieging City Hall.\\nWright, one of five senior Adams administration officials whose homes were raided by federal authorities on Sept. 4, was initially expected to step down this past Friday as part of an effort by the mayor to push out advisers ensnared in the corruption investigations.\\nBut sources familiar with the situation told the Daily News that Wright refused, even as the other four top staffers raided on Sept. 4 — including her husband, outgoing Schools Chancellor David Banks — announced their resignations.\\nFinally, on Tuesday, Wright had submitted her own resignation to the mayor, according to multiple sources familiar with the matter.\\nWright, a lawyer and ex-nonprofit executive who chaired Adams' 2021 transition committee, is expected to be succeeded as first deputy mayor by Maria Torres-Springer, the current deputy mayor for housing and economic development.\\nSpokespeople for the mayor's office didn't immediately return requests for comment Tuesday.\\nThe first deputy is the second-in-command at City Hall and absorbs the mayor's duties when he's out of town. The first deputy also oversees all the administration's other deputy mayors.\\nWright's departure marks at least the 11th high-profile official in the Adams administration to be ousted since the latest corruption investigations came to light last month. On Monday alone, news broke that Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Phil Banks, senior Adams adviser Winnie Greco and Muslim community liaison Mohamed Bahi had resigned, while international affairs aide Rana Abbasova and South Asian affairs adviser Ahsan Chughtai had been fired.\\nAmong other matters, the feds leading the investigations are looking at whether Adams administration officials engaged in a scheme involving influence peddling and kickbacks on city contracts, according to sources familiar with the matter. They have been investigating whether government relations consultant Terence Banks, the younger sibling of Phil and David Banks and Wright's brother-in-law, used his family connections in municipal government to steer city business to his private clients, sources say.\\nThe mayor is indicted on federal criminal charges alleging he for years solicited and accepted bribes from Turkish government operatives in exchange for political favors. He has pleaded not guilty.\\nThe rash of resignations and firings is unfolding after Gov. Hochul, who has the power to remove the mayor from office, demanded publicly that he dump advisers embroiled in the federal investigations.\\nHochul has so far stayed clear of publicly discussing whether she may use her power to remove Adams, who's the only official in his administration to date to be criminally indicted.\\nOriginally Published: October 8, 2024 at 9:30 a.m.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"The ripple effects of the Yankees ' franchise-altering trade for Juan Soto continue to come to light.\\nIn addition to putting up MVP-caliber numbers in his first season in pinstripes, Soto served as a mentor to 25-year-old Oswaldo Cabrera, whose importance has skyrocketed in the ALDS as a fill-in first baseman for the injured Anthony Rizzo.\\n'Soto, for me, is much more than a teammate,' Cabrera said on a Zoom call Sunday between Games 1 and 2 of the postseason series against the Kansas City Royals.\\n'He's like a hitting coach, too. He doesn't know that. He doesn't know how much he helped me in my mind, mentally, and obviously with my mechanics, because every time Soto is in the cage or he is hitting on the field, I am just watching to try to get something I can use.'\\nWatching Soto, a left-handed hitter with power to all fields, taught the switch-hitting Cabrera the importance of being able to hit to the opposite field and to maintain a low-line-drive approach.\\nCabrera posted career highs with eight home runs and 36 RBI in 299 at-bats this season, while his .247 average represented a 36-point improvement from last year in a similar number of plate appearances.\\n'I'm not gonna do the things that he can do,' Cabrera said of Soto, 'but everything that I can take to put on my mechanics and put on my mind, I am open to learn.'\\nAcquired from the San Diego Padres in a seven-player trade last December, the 25-year-old Soto hit .288 with a career-best 41 home runs and 109 RBI in the regular season, primarily out of the two-hole. Already a seven-year MLB veteran, Soto is expected to command a historic contract when he hits free agency after the playoffs.\\nAaron Judge, the Yankees' No. 3 hitter, has spoken about the value of batting behind Soto, whose 129 walks and .419 on-base percentage ranked second among MLB hitters, trailing only Judge.\\nSoto went 3-for-5 in the Yankees' 6-5 win in Game 1 of the ALDS, while Cabrera went 1-for-4 with a double.\\nNormally the Yankees' utilityman, Cabrera started Game 1 at first base after Rizzo suffered two fractured fingers on a hit-by-pitch a week earlier, forcing him off of the ALDS roster.\\nIt's an opportunity Cabrera is not taking lightly.\\n'I've been working to be ready in any situation, so now they gave me the opportunity to play first for the Rizzo situation,' Cabrera said. 'I'm used to trying to do my best to help the team. That's the key all the time.'\\nSaturday marked Cabrera's 18th career appearance and sixth start at first, a position where he's never made an error. The role remains relatively new to Cabrera, as evidenced by him still using the injured DJ LeMahieu's glove while playing there.\\nSince making his MLB debut in 2022, Cabrera has appeared at every position other than catcher, and he's started at all of them besides center field.\\n'To watch him work behind the scenes, [he's] always making sure he's prepared at different positions, so if I throw him in different situations, like he's done that and ready for it, eager,' manager Aaron Boone said Sunday.\\n'When he first came up,' Boone recalled of Cabrera, 'I remember somebody asking, 'What's your favorite position?' 'Whatever one I'm playing that day.' He lives that, and he works incredibly hard.'\\nCabrera has spent extra time working at first base since Rizzo went down, as have rookie Ben Rice and third baseman Jon Berti, both of whom remain in the mix to help fill the veteran's void.\\nRizzo hopes to return by the ALCS, should the Yankees advance that far. Whether he's able to not, Cabrera intends to contribute.\\n'Right now, I can be on first, but in any moment I can go play second, shortstop, third, left field, right field, whatever,' Cabrera said. 'I just want to be ready.'\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Just before throwing his first warmup pitch of the night on Monday, Carlos Rodón took a minute to take in his surroundings.\\nA day earlier, the southpaw had talked about harnessing Yankee Stadium's energy and controlling his sometimes-turbulent emotions. And so with the Bronx burning and Alice In Chains' 'Rooster' blasting over the loudspeakers prior to Game 2 of the ALDS, Rodón stopped to appreciate the packed house before going to work.\\nHe proceeded to snuff out the Royals, fanning Maikel Garcia, Bobby Witt Jr. and Vinnie Pasquantino in the opening inning as his fastball reached 98.3 mph. Suddenly, emotional control didn't seem so important, as a screaming Rodón grew increasingly animated with each strike out.\\nAfter retiring Pasquantino, Rodón strutted off the mound, stuck out his tongue and smiled his way to the dugout.\\nCarlos Rodón strikes out the side and he's fired up! pic.twitter.com/kJcqLhVeUH\\n— Talkin' Yanks (@TalkinYanks) October 7, 2024\\nUnfortunately for Rodón and the Yankees, that display of power and fiery jubilation did not foreshadow an exceptional evening. While the hurler remained efficient for the first three innings of his Yankees postseason debut, he ultimately unraveled in the fourth frame of the Bombers' 4-2 loss.\\nRodón's slider led to his demise, as the Royals plated their first three runs by pouncing on the pitch. Salvador Perez started the scoring for Kansas City in the fourth, crushing a solo shot to left minutes after a Giancarlo Stanton single put the Yankees on the board.\\nRodón hung his breaking ball over the heart of the plate on the dinger. He did the same when Tommy Pham rocketed an RBI single a few batters later. Garrett Hampson then connected with a slider below the zone, adding his own RBI single.\\nThat knocked Rodón out of the game after 3.2 innings.\\nGarcia proceeded to coincidentally single off Ian Hamilton's slider, earning the Royals — and Rodón — a fourth run. The starter also totaled seven hits, zero walks, seven strikeouts and 72 pitches as his night ended in disappointment.\\nWhile Rodón could not maintain his first-inning success on Monday, Royals starter Cole Ragans held the Yankees to one run over four innings. He only allowed three hits, but four walks gave the pinstripers a few squandered opportunities.\\nWhile Jazz Chisholm Jr. launched a solo homer in the ninth, the Yankees went 1-for-6 with runners in scoring position and stranded eight men during the game.\\nWith the series now tied, the Yankees and Royals will head to Kansas City for Game 3 on Wednesday. The Yanks tabbed Clarke Schmidt to start the game, picking the consistent righty over Luis Gil.\\nKansas City had yet to announce its Game 3 starter by the end of Monday's action, but Seth Lugo is an option. The first-time All-Star dominated the Yankees on Sept. 10, striking out 10 over seven scoreless innings.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"An unhinged Uber driver repeatedly threatened to kill a customer who got him kicked off the rideshare app over a service dog, federal prosecutors in Brooklyn allege.\\nMark Bababekov, 47, of Queens, was locked out of the rideshare platform in September 2022 after he cancelled a trip because his fare had a service animal, according to a criminal complaint unsealed Monday. The rider, in turn, file a complaint that got Bababekov's Uber account deactivated, the feds allege.\\nBababekov spent the next two years demanding the company provide him proof the pooch was actually a service animal — and in May, those demands went off the rails, according to the complaint.\\nOven the next four months Bababekov repeatedly told Uber employees he knew where the passenger lived, that he'd run the man over, and that he'd beat him with a baseball bat, federal authorities allege.\\nThough the complaint doesn't name Uber, the rideshare giant was identified Monday at Bababekov's arraignment in Brooklyn Federal Court, and Uber officials confirmed their involvement.\\nHe also called the rider at least 18 times, leaving voicemails threatening to put him in a wheelchair for the rest of his life, the feds allege.\\nThe threats continued despite warnings from the FBI, according to court documents.\\nBababekov's threats started on May 20, when he called Uber's support line, located in the Philippines, and according to the feds ranted: 'I have nothing to lose in life…. (The customer) ruined my life. I am going to ruin his life…. I have no choice but to run him over…. I will run him over, make him permanently disabled…. His life's gonna end.'\\nThe diatribe earned him a visit at his Fresh Meadows home the next day from an FBI agent who 'admonished' him, according to a criminal complaint. He told the agent he'd stop making threats, but that assurance was short-lived.\\nOn June 1, Bababekov wrote a message through Uber's app, warning, 'You have six days left to provide me the documents … if you're not gonna provide me any evidence or any documents, your customer m—–f—– gonna get hurt,' the feds allege.\\nHe sent another message through the app on June 7, and in September he called Uber, describing his lust for violence in detail, the feds allege. One of those calls lasted a half-hour.\\n'I'm a homeless. I'm sleeping in the car for the past three months. There's only one way to prove that I was innocent… to go to his house, and just either kill him or make him disabled,' he said in a recorded Sept. 11 call, according to the complaint. 'Permanently make him disabled, that he cannot even talk. That he only can drink or eat through the straw.'\\nThe complaint also lays out a series of voicemails threatening violence to the customer in August and September.\\n'Yo real estate boy. If you have any balls between your legs, give me a call, or whatever is going to happen next is on you,' Bababekov is accused of saying in a Sept. 19 voicemail. 'I am going to ruin your life, my way. No law will be involved. Watch carefully what will happen.'\\nFinally, in a string of calls to the rideshare company Sept. 24, he vowed, 'I know where the f—ing customer lives. I know where he works…. I have no choice but to f–ing kill him.'\\n'I'm ready to go to jail' and 'by the end of the week, he's gonna die,' the voicemails promised.\\nBababekov was arrested Saturday and charged with transmitting a threat through interstate communications. He could face up to five years in prison if convicted at trial.\\nUber officials told the Daily News on Monday the threats started about a month after a neutral arbitrator upheld the company's decision to remove him from the platform.\\n'Threats of violence will not be tolerated and our teams proactively reported this alarming behavior to authorities. We appreciate their quick action and will continue to support their investigation,' Uber spokesman Josh Gold said.\\nBababekov still works as a car service driver for a Manhattan-based livery base. The city Taxi and Limousine Commission is seeking to suspend his license, TLC spokesman Jason Kersten said Monday.\\nHe was released on $75,000 bond and place on home detention, though he's allowed to leave his home because of his job.\\nBrooklyn Federal Court Magistrate Judge Lois Bloom warned Bababekov he couldn't reach out to the passenger, 'and also Uber, you can't talk to them at all.'\\nWhen Bababekov signaled he wanted to sue Uber, the judge warned: 'I'm telling you sir, that you are creating this bad situation for yourself… Deal with this case. Don't talk about filing a civil case against Uber.'\\nShe added, 'Now you have a criminal case against you. Worry about proving your innocence.'\\nHis lawyer, Michael Schneider of the Federal Defenders, declined to comment Monday.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Tickets for the Mega Millions lottery are getting a mega price hike.\\nBeginning April 2025, the cost of a Mega Millions ticket will go up from $2 to $5 — marking a 150% increase.\\nThat's just one of many upcoming changes to the game that officials hope will result in improved jackpot odds, more frequent giant prizes and even larger payouts.\\n'Spending 5 bucks to become a millionaire or billionaire, that's pretty good,' said Joshua Johnston, director of the Washington Lottery and lead director of the group that oversees Mega Millions.\\nAs it now stands, the odds of winning the Mega Millions jackpot stands at around 1 in 302.6 million. But lotto officials hope that increasing ticket revenue and rejiggering the odds will yield more major jackpot wins — even as prizes grow extraordinarily high — which, will in turn, attract more players.\\nThe upcoming change marks only the second price hike since Mega Millions was launched more than 20 years ago. In 2017, the cost jumped from $1 to $2, matching the price of a Powerball ticket. That's also when Mega Millions implemented its current format of selecting six total numbers from two separate pools, all of which have to match, including the gold Mega ball, for a player to win the jackpot.\\nIn the years since, the jackpot has ballooned past the billion-dollar mark six times, most recently in 2023, when a Florida ticket-holder won $1.6 billion. Three of the lottery's top 10 biggest-ever jackpots occurred this year alone.\\nAdditional changes to Mega Millions will include the end of 'breakeven prizes,' meaning that every winning ticket will be more than the $5 cost. Even more updates are slated to be announced in the coming months as part of the lottery's 'mega overhaul.'\\n'We expect more billion-dollar jackpots than ever before, meaning creating more billionaires and many more millionaires as the jackpots climb,' Johnston said, 'plus this game will continue the important legacy of supporting great causes everywhere Mega Millions is played.'\\nPowerball officials meanwhile have said they have no plans to change their game's odds or the $2 price for most tickets.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Attorneys general in 13 states and the District of Columbia have filed lawsuits against TikTok for harming the mental health of children and teens and misleading the public about the platform's safety.\\nThe lawsuits, all filed individually in state courts, allege the 'addictive' video-sharing platform has violated state laws by claiming the app is safe for young people.\\nIn reality, several of its users struggle with poor mental health and body image issues. Some even physically harm themselves because of the so-called TikTok 'challenges,' which are created and promoted on the platform, according to the bipartisan coalition of attorneys general.\\n'TikTok claims that their platform is safe for young people, but that is far from true, ' New York AG Letitia James said in a statement Tuesday. 'In New York and across the country, young people have died or gotten injured doing dangerous TikTok challenges and many more are feeling more sad, anxious, and depressed because of TikTok's addictive features.'\\nThe 14 attorneys general, from states including New York, New Jersey and California, have filed the lawsuits to 'help combat the nationwide youth mental health crisis,' James said. 'Kids and families across the country are desperate for help to address this crisis, and we are doing everything in our power to protect them. '\\nAccording to California Attorney General Rob Bonta, TikTok deliberately uses social media addiction to boost profits. Children are 'intentionally' targeted because the company knows 'kids do not yet have the defenses or capacity to create healthy boundaries around addictive content.'\\nEven though the app is only available for users older than 13, children can easily bypass TikTok's minimum age restrictions, the complaint filed by D.C. Attorney General Brian Schwalb alleges.\\nOfficials also accuse the company of enabling the sexual exploitation of children — and profiting from it — through its live-streaming feature, which allows the app to essentially operate like a virtual strip club with no age restrictions.\\nTikTok, which is owned by Chinese company ByteDance, strongly pushed back against the complaints, slamming the claims as 'inaccurate and misleading.'\\n'We're proud of and remain deeply committed to the work we've done to protect teens and we will continue to update and improve our product,' a company spokesperson said in a reply to the lawsuits. 'It is incredibly disappointing [the AGs] have taken this step rather than work with us on constructive solutions to industrywide challenges.'\\nEarlier this year, President Joe Biden signed a law requiring ByteDance to divest the app or see it banned in the U.S. due to national security concerns. In May, the company sued the U.S. government for enacting 'a law that subjects a single, named speech platform to a permanent, nationwide ban, and bars every American from participating in a unique online community.'\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"A Long Island construction company owner said he got into deep debt with the mafia and Bonnano soldier John 'The Maniac' Ragano because the COVID pandemic all but killed his business.\\nVincent Martino, 47, a mob associate and on-again, off-again marijuana distributor, described the circumstances that brought him into the orbit of Ragano — a contentious relationship that the feds say ended with the hulking, blustery mobster forcing him to strip naked to prove he wasn't wearing a wire.\\nRagano, 62, is on trial in Brooklyn Federal Court for extortion and other charges for forcing Martino to keep paying his debt even after Ragano was sentenced to five years in prison for, among other crimes, extorting Martino over that same loan.\\n'On July 5, 2023, the defendant, John Ragano, forced a man who owed him money [Martino] to strip naked in a garage in Queens and threatened to slap the s–t out of him,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew Reich said in his opening argument Tuesday. 'What he didn't know and what he couldn't know is that Martino still managed to record the whole thing.'\\nMartino's testimony, which started Tuesday afternoon, hasn't covered the garage episode yet, or where he hid the recording device. He'll continue on the stand Wednesday.\\nRagano, who also goes by the nickname 'Bazoo,' and Martino were co-defendant's in a union shakedown indictment that led to the convictions of the entire leadership of the Colombo crime family. Martino was charged with going into the marijuana trafficking business with Ragano and others.\\nHis business was already struggling, and in 2020, 'Basically the entire country was shut down,' he said. Though he got some COVID relief funds, he needed more, and he couldn't find a bank to lend him money, he said.\\n'I went to the street loans,' he said.\\nMartino, who had ties to the mob, said he knew Ragano from a few mafia parties.\\nHe first borrowed $25,000 from a Colombo crime family mobster, then another $100,000 from longtime Colombo soldier Michael Uvino, he said. His debt kept 'snowballing,' he said, so he borrowed $150,000 from Ragano, with the understanding that his weekly payments of $2,250 were meant to cover the interest alone.\\nInformant Andrew Koslosky — a classical tenor and theater performer who's now singing for the feds — testified he acted as go-between, collecting weekly payments from Martino.\\nRagano wanted the businessman to know that he'd 'slap the s–t out of' Martino if he fell behind, so Koslosky warned him to keep making payments.\\n'John was well-known by everybody as someone who was intimidating,' Koslosky, 66, said. 'He wasn't somebody you should be fooling around with…. When he put his fist down on the desk, the whole room shook.'\\nAs to why Koslosky turned snitch, the church singer explained, 'For two reasons. I didn't want to go to jail, and I didn't want to go to hell.'\\nMartino testified he was making regular payments until the Sept. 2021 takedown that led to his and Ragano's arrest.\\nRagano was ultimately convicted in the union shakedown indictment — part of which included the loan to Martino — and started his five-year prison sentence on July 10, 2023.\\nBut despite that arrest and the looming sentence, he still pressured Martino to keep paying his debt, unaware that Martino had gone to the FBI and started recording their interactions, the feds allege.\\nAt each court conference, Ragano would approach Martino asking him about the money, Martino said.\\nHe told Martino to contact an associate, Simone Barca, who'd collect on his behalf, but Martino ducked Barca's calls, afraid of violating the terms of his bail, he testified.\\nWhen Ragano left a voicemail on Martino's phone wishing him a happy new year, Martino realized it was time to call the FBI, he said. From there, he agreed to wear a wire, and started calling Barca, arranging phone calls and meetings that the feds could record, he said.\\nRagano's lawyer, Ken Womble, said prosecutors were only providing part of the picture. 'Yes, John Ragano was in the mafia. We admit that. You can judge him morally for that. Don't hold that against him,' he said.\\nWomble said that Ragano was simply trying to have a debt repaid, and wasn't threatening Martino.\\n'Asking for a loan to be paid back is no crime at all,' he said. 'Folks, the call is coming from inside the house … This is a case about money amongst mobsters. That's the whole story of this case.'\\nOriginally Published: October 8, 2024 at 7:03 p.m.\",\n",

Can you please hold on and get them done?' And he was willing to do that and I appreciate him for that,' Adams said.\\nBanks, who served with Adams in the NYPD and has been a key political confidant to him for decades, did not immediately return a request for comment.\\nThe deputy mayor's departure comes after he and four other top Adams advisers had their homes raided and electronics seized on Sept. 4 as part of multiple federal corruption investigations scrutinizing whether city officials were engaged in schemes involving influence peddling, kickbacks on city contracts and NYPD nightlife enforcement misuse, among other matters.\\nPrior to Monday, three of those officials — Schools Chancellor David Banks, senior Adams adviser Tim Pearson and NYPD Commissioner Edward Caban — had already announced their resignations.\\nNow that Phil Banks, the chancellor's younger brother, is also headed for the door, only one other official who was hit by the feds Sept. 4 remains part of the Adams administration: Sheena Wright, the first deputy mayor.\\nSources have said, though, that Wright, Chancellor Banks' wife, is also about to resign.

       "   'summary': \"Kamala Harris launched a new media blitz on Monday with appearances on '60 Minutes' and other shows aimed at a wide range of demographic groups as the presidential campaign enters the final month before Election Day.\\nThe Democratic nominee told the venerable CBS News program that she has a better economic plan for the middle class than former President Trump, who backed out of a similar interview with the show.\\n'My economic plan would strenghen our ecoomy,' Harris told correspondent Bill Whitaker. 'His would hurt it,'\\nHarris, who has faced criticism over her relatively paltry number of interviews since launching her campaign in July, parried Whitaker's aggressive but respectful questioning about how realistic her plans are.\\n'I'm going to make sure that the richest among us who can affor ti t pay their fair share,' Harris said. 'It is not right that teachers, nurses and firefighters are paying a hihger tax rate than billionaires and the biggest corporations.'\\nThe '60 Minutes' interview was set to air in full at 8 p.m. Monday night. The show typically does a presidential election special including interviews with both candidates, but Trump backed out after initially accepting the request from CBS, the network said.\\nHarris also defended the U.S. alliance with Israel, although she avoided declaring that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a 'real, close ally.'\\n'With all due respect, the better question is whether we have an important alliance between the American and the Israeli people,' Harris said. 'And the answer to that question yes.'\\nHarris also plans a flurry of media sit-downs with a diverse group of non-traditional media this week as early voting ramps up across the nation and the election remains a virtual dead heat.\\nOn Tuesday, she will do interviews with shock jock Howard Stern, whose show appeals to a predominantly male audience as well as an appearance on the famously female-centric 'The View' and 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.'\\nThe vice president will participate in a town hall-style event on Thursday hosted by Univision in Las Vegas aimed at Latino voters, a key Democratic-leaning constituency in several swing states.\\nHarris kicked off the high-octane week with an interview on the 'Call Her Daddy' podcast, which has an audience of millions of mostly young women.\\nShe slammed Republican efforts to shame women like her who do not have biological children, a tack that JD Vance used in his infamous barb against 'childless cat ladies.'\\n'I just think it's mean and mean-spirited,' said Harris, who is a stepmother to the two children of her husband, Doug Emhoff. 'We each have our family by blood and then we have our family by love. And I have both. And I consider it to be a real blessing.'\\nHarris' campaign hopes to put to bed complaints that she has shied away from tough questioning. She is also aiming to expand her gaping lead over Trump with female voters while seeking to blunt his advantage with men and those without a college degree.\\nTrump on the other hand has stayed within his right-wing comfort zone, doing regular rallies to adoring and large crowds of MAGA loyalists and granting interviews almost exclusively to right-wing media outlets.\\nHis campaign believes his path to victory includes maximizing his support from his base of working-class white men while picking off a significant chunk of backing from other demographics with tough talk on hot-button issues like crime, inflation and especially immigration.\\nIn a chummy interview with conservative host Hugh Hewitt on Monday, Trump accused Harris of allowing immigrants who have a genetic predisposition to criminal behavior to enter the U.S.\\n'We got a lot of bad genes in our country right now,' said Trump, while spewing false and misleading figures about immigrants. 'They … had 425,000 people come into our country that shouldn't be here, that are criminals.'\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Fix congestion without punishing needed drivers\\nManhattan: In his 'Be Our Guest' op-ed on Oct. 3 (' Congestion pricing is not the (complete) answer '), James F. McShane clearly outlines the major causes, in my long-held opinion, of gridlock. He describes the narrowing of two, three and four lanes of traffic on city streets to one or two lanes to accommodate bike lanes (which are minimally used, especially on side streets) and bus lanes (which, from what I can see, are often blocked by delivery trucks or illegally standing cars).\\nAs a native New Yorker, I have seen numerous changes over many years. I remember when traffic moved, sometimes slowly, but it did move. People had respect for ambulances, fire engines and police cars and tried to move out of the way. Now, with so little room to maneuver, it's impossible. Plus, with little or no vehicle policing, drivers have no compunction about blocking the box.\\nCongestion pricing can't solve the problem. People will continue to turn away from public transit because it is often dirty and slow and, based on what is written and viewed in the media, frightening. In addition, people with disabilities can't use most public transit because most subways are inaccessible, and buses often can't load/unload passengers at sidewalks (due to unauthorized vehicles in bus stops). Dropping more money down the MTA's bottomless gullet will not solve the problems, no matter how much. Vehicles have been part of New Yorkers' mobility and always will be. Trying to squeeze them out will only result in more frustration among the driving public and in those of us who are mobility-impaired and must use cars to get around. Minette Gorelik\\nA little illegal?\\nBronx: Mayor Adams' Chief Advisor Ingrid Lewis-Martin states, 'We have not done anything illegal to the magnitude and scale that requires the federal government or the DA office to investigate us.' So they have done illegal things, just not to that scale. This is the most corrupt mayor ever in the city of New York. Richie Nagan\\nBad boss\\nForest Hills: Why would any labor union endorse a candidate who became famous for telling people, 'You're fired'? Alan Hirschberg\\nPressing buttons\\nBrooklyn: Ah, I see Voicer Joie Anderson is back from vacation! 'Do we really want this self-absorbed clown to have his finger on the button?' It seems that even on vacation, no one put the button on you! Charlie Wyatt\\nUnexpected ally\\nValley Stream, L.I.: Who says Donald Trump divides people? I've been on opposite sides of every issue with former Vice President Dick Cheney my entire life, but here we are both supporting and voting for Kamala Harris. Only Trump could have brought us together like that. Praise unity! By the way, I already voted for Harris by mail. I could have gone to vote in person but I liked the idea of being included in deluded MAGA conspiracy theories. Allan Canino\\nLying lemmings\\nBrooklyn: Why so many comments by Voicers about JD Vance being a liar? Remember, the fish stinks from the head down. Trump is the liar-in-chief. He lies with compunction, and to impress him, his peons feel they have a license to do the same thing. It would be wise to take anything those in his orbit say with a grain of salt. June Lowe\\nCold comfort\\nBrooklyn: The economy (Bidenomics) added 108,000 jobs in April, 216,000 in May, 118,000 in June, 144,000 in July and 159,000 in August. Sluggish at best, especially during the summer hiring season. Bidenomics can no longer rely on 'recovered lost pandemic jobs.' Now we are supposed to rejoice because September's job growth was 254,000? What about the 3½ years of suffering Americans had to go through with high gas prices and high grocery bills? Housing costs are high because the mortgage rates remain high, double what they were under Trump, which is why more people are opting to rent instead of buy. Shortage of rental properties are making housing costs skyrocket. The rate of inflation increase may have come down, which may help a little going forward, but grocery and gas prices remain high. So, there is no joy in one month's decent jobs report. David DiBello\\nSurprising blindness\\nGlendale: The perspective of this paper warrants a full-scale investigation. Hearsay does not convict anyone of anything, except when hateful rhetoric filled with indignation and contempt for the truth causes mayhem and chaos. The only 'October surprise' surrounding the 2024 elections has to do with how many people can still be swayed by interpretations of past events, wanting the American people to overlook reality that is staring us all in the face: An anointed candidate with no real sense of policy or ethics placed into a role no one voted for her to be in versus a proven leader with a clear vision for our democracy. It's the blind leading the blind when we have to distinguish between what is right and what we're supposed to believe. The only waking up this country needs is to remind ourselves that united we stand, divided we fall. Jonathan Kiddrane\\nCitizens betrayed\\nPearl River, N.Y.: Every American should be outraged by the federal government and its response, or lack of it, to Hurricane Helene's devastation. This same government has depleted FEMA's emergency money and given generously to illegal migrants who have not paid any taxes or contributed in any way, shape or form, to our country, and ignored its American citizens. I don't believe it has anything to do with political affiliation. I do believe it has to do with gross incompetence. Every registered voter needs to remember this catastrophe when they go to the polls. Enough is enough. Robert Brennan\\nTwo-way street\\nBronx: Yes, Voicer Carmine E. Esposito, everybody has the right to write and speak their opinion, and that right should be respected. But the flip side is that all sides need to abide by that. When nearly half the country supports a candidate who tried to make himself a dictator and vows revenge on those who oppose him, don't expect me to respect that. If you want me to respect your rights, respect mine. Richard Warren\\nStop the killing\\nManhattan: I have faithfully prayed for an immediate permanent ceasefire between Israel and Palestine since Oct. 7, 2023. On the first anniversary of this war, I am pleading with all elected officials to renounce the genocide of innocent Palestinians. Please stop using our hard-earned tax dollars to finance further Israeli attacks. Please stop giving Israel weapons to kill more harmless Palestinians. Please stop looking the other way. Please stop pointing your fingers across political party lines. I implore you to stop the genocide! Jews ought to be ashamed of themselves as they cry, 'Never again.' My heart weeps as I learn of the daily atrocities. I am calling upon all BIPOC clergy to unite in a resolve for an immediate permanent ceasefire between the Israelis and Palestinians. Injustice in Palestine is a cosmic threat everywhere. Ronald J. Wells\\nSound off\\nWhite Plains, N.Y.: I can empathize with Bob Brody (' It's the playoffs, show me the metrics,' op-ed, Oct. 2) about the overload of metrics while watching a baseball game. I have found a simple solution. Mute the sound on the television. Sometimes, silence is golden. Randi Bernstein Feigenbaum\\nCut QB\\nManhattan: Is Geno Smith really better than Daniel Jones of the New York Giants? I recall NFL experts, the Giants and the New York Jets chasing Smith out of town. It's about the team around the quarterback. Edward Drossman\\nLives prevented\\nGlendale: Voicer Wendy Packus is absolutely correct with her analogy between abortion and the mass killings committed by the Nazis during the 1940s. Her only mistake, however, is understating the sheer scope of each policy. While the Nazis killed approximately 6 million Jews, that number pales in comparison to the approximately 63 million pre-born babies whose lives have been taken away under the banner of choice. Many people may recall in the 1990s, when the Democrats stated that abortion should be 'safe, legal and rare.' That motto has been superseded with 'legal, plentiful and profitable.'\",\n",

No information on exact locations or targets was released.\\nTawhedi was arrested Monday, after which he allegedly confirmed to investigators the attack was planned for Election Day and that he and a juvenile co-conspirator expected to die as martyrs.\\nTawhedi, who entered the U.S. in 2021 on a special immigrant visa, had recently bought one-way tickets for his wife and child to fly back to Afghanistan and had been liquidating his family's assets. He had also been communicating with ISIS fighters in chat apps and contributing to a fake charity that funnels money to the terrorist organization.\\nA Facebook post with various personal belongings for sale led to FBI scrutiny. On Monday, Tawhedi and the juvenile met with undercover agents in a rural location in Oklahoma to purchase weapons. After taking receipt of two AK-47 assault rifles, ten magazines and 500 rounds of ammunition, the two were taken into custody.\\n'Their ultimate aim was to stage a violent attack in the United States in the name of and on behalf of ISIS,' prosecutors wrote.\\nTawhedi was charged with conspiring and attempting to provide material support to ISIS, which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. He was also charged with receiving a firearm to be used to commit a felony or a federal crime of terrorism, which carries a maximum prison sentence of 15 years, if convicted.\\nNo information about his co-conspirator was released.\\n'As charged, the Justice Department foiled the defendant's plot to acquire semi-automatic weapons and commit a violent attack in the name of ISIS on U.S. soil on Election Day,' said U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland.\\n'I am proud of the men and women of the FBI who uncovered and stopped the plot before anyone was harmed,' added FBI director Christopher Wray.

       "   'summary': \"The reinvention of Sean Manaea started with a haircut in spring training. Then, he dropped his arm slot over the summer and became dominant.\\nThe culmination of his reinvention is unfolding at the right time. Manaea carved up the Philadelphia Phillies' lineup Tuesday night in the Mets' 7-2 win in Game 3 of the NLDS. The Subway-riding, chess-playing, world-traveling hurler was ultra-efficient, limiting the Phillies to only three hits over seven shutout innings, before he was charged with a run in the eighth.\\nPhil Maton came in for Manaea with one on and none out in the eighth and allowed an inherited runner to score before giving up a run of his own.\\nBut by the eighth, the game was nearly out of reach for the Phillies, with the Mets holding a 6-0 lead. Lindor made it 7-2 with a two-out RBI double off Carlos Estévez in the eighth.\\nPete Alonso and Jesse Winker each homered off right-hander Aaron Nola. Starling Marte drove in two huge runs in the sixth and Jose Iglesias did the same in the seventh.\\nCiti Field was quite the sight on Tuesday night, with nearly 45,000 fans clad in blue and orange and a whole lot of purple dotting the stands. Grimace is proving to be a popular Halloween costume around the city this year.\\nWho could have possibly predicted any of this? So much about the Mets have always been weird, wacky and unpredictable, but especially this season. They embraced a McDonald's mascot, they honored a veteran named Seymour Weiner and at one point, sunk to 11 games under .500.\\nBut this win felt wholly predictable. After starting the playoffs on the road, they were eager to share their success with their fans.\\nWhen Alonso hit an opposite-field home run off Nola to lead off the second inning and give the Mets a 1-0 lead, the crowd exploded. It felt like it was already over and with the way Manaea was pitching, it practically was.\\nWinker hit a towering shot to right field off Nola in the fourth inning to make it 2-0. Nola missed badly with a fastball, leaving it belt-high over the heart of the plate.\\nNola failed to get an out in the sixth, loading the bases before the Phillies went to Kerking. Jose Iglesias hit a slow roller to Edmundo Sosa at second base and he nabbed the runner at home. But Iglesias was safe at first on the force, keeping the bases loaded.\\nWith two out, Marte hit a line drive to center field to score two and put the Mets up 4-0.\\nThe Mets loaded the bases again in the seventh, this time with two outs against left-hander Jose Alvarado. And again, Iglesias came up to the plate to face the new pitcher, right-hander Jose Ruiz.\\nHe put it in play, hitting a single up the middle to score two more.\\nManaea came back out for the eighth, but was lifted after Sosa beat the tag on a ground ball to third base for a single. He struck out six and walked three over more than seven innings, the most he had ever pitched in a playoff game.\\nThe fans saluted him with a roaring ovation as he exited the field.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"The last remaining buildings of the Tropicana Las Vegas hotel and casino will be imploded in the wee hours of Wednesday morning.\\nOnly two hotel towers of the old resort remained standing Tuesday, six months after the Tropicana closed its doors. Those towers are scheduled to fall around 2:30 a.m. Wednesday — in stereotypical Las Vegas fashion, accompanied by a drone show and fireworks.\\nThere will be no public viewing areas for Wednesday morning's show, but it will broadcast on local TV stations and visible from nearby hotels.\\nThe Tropicana's fate was sealed in May 2023, when its owners at Bally's Corporation reached a deal with the Oakland A's to build a ballpark on the site. That park is supposed to be ready for the 2028 MLB season, with construction taking place for the next three years.\\nBut the first step will be destruction. Las Vegas has become notorious for blowing up formerly pricey casinos and putting up new superstructures in their place. The Tropicana will be just the latest in a long line of old casinos to fall, including the Dunes, Sands, Desert Inn, Aladdin and Stardust.\\n'What Las Vegas has done, in classic Las Vegas style, they've turned many of these implosions into spectacles,' Geoff Schumacher of the city's Mob Museum told The Associated Press.\\nCasino magnate Steve Wynn was credited with turning demolition into a must-watch scene when he created a whole show around the implosion of the Dunes in 1993 to build the Bellagio.\\nThe city's most recent implosion occurred all the way back in 2016, when the Riviera was destroyed to make room for an expanded convention center.\\nAt the time it closed, the Tropicana was the third-oldest casino on the Strip, behind only the Sahara and the Flamingo.\",\n",

Parker, an assistant in the office of the deputy mayor for public safety, and Daughtry, NYPD's deputy commissioner for operations, are both under serious consideration for the high-ranking position, the sources said.\\nDaughtry declined comment, and Parker could not be immediately reached. It wasn't immediately who else might be under consideration.\\n'I received six calls from people who are outside of government who asked, 'Could they be considered for the position?'' Adams said at his briefing. 'I have some people in government who reached out to me and stated that, could they be considered for the position?'\\nAdams spokesman Fabien Levy declined to address the potential appointment of either Parker or Daughtry. 'When we have an announcement to make, we'll make sure to make it,' he said.\\nBanks resigned last weekend after having his home raided and electronics seized as part of the federal corruption investigations ensnaring the Adams administration. As deputy mayor, he worked closely with the NYPD and oversaw the fire and corrections departments as well as the emergency management agency.\\nAdams is facing federal criminal charges for allegedly soliciting bribes from the government of Turkey and its associates in exchange for political favors. He has said Banks first told him he wanted to resign months earlier, but that he convinced him to stay on to complete some initiatives.\\n'It's just unbelievable what he did on many of these areas,' Adams said Tuesday of Banks, who he insisted left of his own violation and not because of the federal investigations into his administration.\\nBanks was first appointed by Adams to the role in January 2022, a pick that raised controversy given Banks had been named an unindicted co-conspirator in a sweeping corruption probe. He was not charged with any wrongdoing.\\nTim Pearson, a high-level public safety adviser to Adams who also recently stepped down after being embroiled in a corruption probe, will also be replaced, the mayor said. Pearson oversaw migrant contracts for the city and faces four sexual harassment lawsuits and one lawsuit alleging he attacked migrant shelter security guards.\\n'We also are going to look at how did we utilize that senior advisor position as well to go in and monitor particularly when we deal with those in asylum seekers, to make sure that we were saving taxpayers dollars,' Adams said.\\nA number of high-level administration officials have resigned since the mayor's indictment on Sept. 26.\\nAmong those who have announced their resignation are all five officials who had their homes searched or devices seized by the feds on Sept. 4: Pearson, Banks, his older brother, outgoing Schools Chancellor David Banks, former First Deputy Mayor Sheena Wright, David's wife, and Edward Caban, the ex-NYPD commissioner.\\nOriginally Published:\",\n",

Critics say he would end aid to Kyiv and force Ukraine to surrender huge swaths of its territory to appease Putin.\\nThe calls could violate the Logan Act, which bars private citizens from engaging in diplomacy with foreign leaders. But experts say it is rarely charged because it is difficult to prove.\\nThe close relationship between the two leaders is underlined by Trump's decision to give several COVID testing devices to Putin at a time when the pandemic was sweeping the world and the famously germaphobic Putin was scared of being infected.\\nWoodward reports that Putin warned Trump to keep the gift under wraps to protect political blowback.\\n'Don't tell anybody you sent these to me,' Putin told Trump.\\n'I don't care. Fine,' Trump replied.\\n'No, no. I don't want you to tell anybody because people will get mad at you, not me,' Putin responded. 'They don't care about me.'\\nVice President Kamala Harris, Trump's opponent in the November election, denounced the former president over the revelations in an interview with Howard Stern on Tuesday.\\n'(It's) just the most recent stark example of who Donald Trump is,' Harris said.\\nTrump denied all the revelations in the Woodward book through a campaign spokesman.\\n'None of these made-up stories by Bob Woodward are true and are the work of a truly demented and deranged man who suffers from a debilitating case of Trump Derangement Syndrome,' Steven Cheung, the spokesman, said in a statement.\\nThe book, Woodward's fourth tell-all since Trump first won the White House in 2016, also reveals spicy details about Biden.\\nThe president dropped f-bombs in deriding both Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in separate conversations with aides.\\nBiden also reportedly told aides he regretted appointing Attorney General Merrick Garland because of the way he handled the case of his son, Hunter.\\nOriginally Published: October 8, 2024 at 1:41 p.m.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Cissy Houston, a Grammy-Award-winning singer and the mother of Whitney Houston, has died. She was 91.\\nHouston died Monday morning surrounded by family in her New Jersey home, her daughter-in-law Pat Houston told The Associated Press. She had been under hospice care for Alzheimer's disease.\\nThe singer was born Emily Drinkard in Newark on Sept. 30, 1933. The youngest of eight children, she got her start in the music industry at an early age, performing with siblings Anne, Larry and Nicky as The Drinkard Four. The group later added more members and was rechristened The Drinkard Singers. In 1957, their album 'A Joyful Noise' was released by RCA Records and became the first gospel record put out by a major label.\\nHouston was later a part of the Sweet Inspirations — with Doris Troy and Dee Dee Warrick — a vocal group known for singing backup for artists like Otis Redding, Wilson Picket, Elvis Presley, Van Morrison and Dionne Warwick. Both Warwicks were Houston's nieces.\\nIn 1967, the group sang on Van Morrison's 'Brown Eyed Girl' while Houston sang on Aretha Franklin's 'Ain't No Way.'\\nHouston went on to become an in-demand session singer, collaborating with the likes of Chaka Khan, Jimi Hendrix, Luther Vandross, Beyoncé, Paul Simon, Roberta Flack and Whitney Houston on hundreds of songs over several decades.\\nHouston won the best traditional soul gospel album Grammy in 1997 for 'Face to Face in 1997 and 'He Leadeth Me' the next year. They marked the only Grammy nominations she received during her career.\\nShe also wrote three books: 'He Leadeth Me,' 'How Sweet The Sound: My Life with God and Gospel' and 'Remembering Whitney: A Mother's Story of Life, Loss and The Night The Music Stopped.'\\nWhitney Houston died in 2012 at the age of 48 after accidentally drowning in a hotel bathtub.\\n'I'm angry she died alone, in those conditions,' she wrote in the memoir. 'I'm still mad about that.'\\n'Our hearts are filled with pain and sadness, daughter-in-law Pat Houston said in a statement. 'We lost the matriarch of our family. Mother Cissy has been a strong and towering figure in our lives. A woman of deep faith and conviction, who cared greatly about family, ministry, and community. Her more than seven-decade career in music and entertainment will remain at the forefront of our hearts.'\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"SEATTLE — Daniel Jones lowered his shoulder on a couple of his runs Sunday, initiating contact with defenders rather than absorbing it. Then he was equally as spicy at the postgame podium.\\nThis was D.J. in attack mode. This was a franchise quarterback, who has been ridiculed by fellow NFL players and media alike, pushing back after a strong performance and a statement 29-20 road win.\\n'A lot was made of not being able to run the ball as well last week,' Jones said, shoving the Giants' 5.1 yards per carry in doubters' faces after a week's worth of heat for their 1.1 yards per carry against Dallas. 'I think we understand who we are and what we can be. You try not to get too distracted by some of the stuff that comes up after one game. We have a lot of confidence in our run game.'\\nJones was then asked how he avoids getting distracted by the constant media attention in New York. The normally reserved quarterback leaned right into it.\\n'I think just knowing what's real, knowing what's actually going on, what happened,' Jones said. 'You can't follow the storyline of the week. I think that's just about focusing on what we do, listening to the opinions that matter. That's the people in the building — coaches, teammates — and focus on that. Not distracting yourself or allowing yourself to look outside of it.\\n'I thought we did a good job of that this week, and that's important for us as a team,' the sixth-year veteran added. 'But [there will] always be a story of the week or idea that's out there, and it's our job to know what's real, fix the problems that are real and ignore the things that aren't.'\\nThis us-against-the-world attitude permeated through the team Sunday. The other issue under the Giants' skin was the constant focus on their inability to make explosive passing plays down the field on Jones deep balls.\\nWhile praising wide receiver Darius Slayton, head coach Brian Daboll stopped to ask a reporter how many yards Slayton's longest catch of the day was.\\nDaboll knew the answer: 41. It was the Giants' first 40-plus yard passing play of the season. He was just making a point, shoving it back in the media's face.\\nSlayton mocked the media's harping on Jones missing some deep throws in the Cowboys game, as well.\\n'He hit the shots today that, you know, everyone's been saying we need to hit,' Slayton said, smiling and rolling his eyes.\\nJones threw a jab about the Slayton completion, as well.\\n'I think, yeah, you know, there is a storyline I guess there,' he said.\\nThis edge from the Giants, and Jones in particular, is welcome and arguably necessary given that no one truly believes in their ability to contend this year except for them.\\nJones posted his best quarterback rating this season (109.6) on Sunday and the ninth-best of his career.\\nHe completed 23 of 34 passes for 234 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions. It was Jones' third game in four weeks with two TD passes, no interceptions and a rating of at least 100.0.\\nHe also racked up a season-high 38 rushing yards on 11 carries, making him the first quarterback in Giants history to rush for at least 2,000 yards (he now has 2,022).\\nIt's not just what he did Sunday, though. It's how he did it.\\nJones drove his body into Seahawks defenders. When Seattle's players pummeled him with big hits, he got right up and continued dissecting them efficiently.\\nHe was undeterred.\\nThis is the same quarterback who was being trashed by other NFL players and national media after his preseason pick-six against the Houston Texans and his Week 1 pick-six against the Minnesota Vikings.\\nIt has become trendy in the NFL to mock Jones, from Baker Mayfield years ago to the San Francisco 49ers players last season to corner Patrick Peterson this offseason and on down the line.\\nThe Giants' decision to pay him big bucks while letting players like Saquon Barkley and Xavier McKinney leave is not viewed by critics — including many NFL players — as the proper allocation of resources.\\nEven teammate Kayvon Thibodeaux said in January that he thought Barkley should have been paid before Jones. And the Giants' front office and coaching staff scouted quarterbacks to draft one this past April as Jones' replacement, but just couldn't move up to get Jayden Daniels or Drake Maye.\\nThat puts them on an obvious track to closely scout the 2025 NFL Draft class' quarterbacks, as well.\\nSo it's Jones against the proverbial world. That makes him a good leader for a Giants team in the same predicament, frankly, out to prove themselves right and everyone else wrong.\\nAnd if he plays this way consistently, it becomes harder to imagine the Giants would be in the first-round quarterback market come draft time — although that decision won't be made until Jones has this year's runway to prove if he can be this consistently effective or not.\\nThat's what makes Jones' shoulder-lowering on his runs so positively contagious, though. It indicates he's running towards the storm, determined to push his way straight through it.\\nSlayton joked that as Jones' teammate, he'd rather not see the quarterback take so many hits.\\n'That's about the only thing that's cringy about his play sometimes,' Slayton said with a laugh. 'I'm like 'Look, hey, man. I know you're Mr. Tough Guy and all that, but [let's] get the yards and get down.'\\nThat's not who Jones is, though. And maybe the Giants are better off because of it. It certainly seemed that way Sunday.\\n'Any time a quarterback does that — you got to be smart about it — but he's a true competitor,' Daboll said. 'There was a play couple weeks back, him pushing on the goal line in Cleveland. He's a competitive young man who — again, Daniel Jones has done everything that I and we have asked him to do.\\n'He's here early,' the coach said. 'He stays late. He's got good leadership traits. It's never been easy for him, but everything we've asked him to do he does it the very best he can do it. He's played some good football here. We're going to need him to continue to do that.'\\nJones then walked off the podium to greet his parents, who had attended Sunday's game in person in Seattle, feeling 'comfortable' and 'confident' and pleased with shutting up the skeptics for one week.\\n'Just practicing staying focused on what is important,' Jones said.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"The ball didn't quite hop like this before.\\nIf there's any takeaway from the Knicks' preseason opener against the Charlotte Hornets on Sunday—the first of five exhibition games before the Oct. 22 regular-season opener against the Boston Celtics—it's the free-flowing offense on display from the new-look team.\\nThis was the debut of the retooled Knicks roster after blockbuster trades netted Mikal Bridges and Karl-Anthony Towns. With Towns at center, Jalen Brunson at point, and versatile wings like Bridges, OG Anunoby and Josh Hart rounding out the lineup, the team showcased a fluid, pace-and-space approach that could help power a deep playoff run in the Eastern Conference.\\nThe emphasis on ball movement, spacing, and playing at a faster pace was evident during their 111-109 victory at Charlotte's Spectrum Center on Sunday. Even with the starters playing an average of only 15 minutes, it was clear the Knicks have potential as a formidable five-out offense, boosted by their revamped lineup.\\nHead coach Tom Thibodeau unveiled his projected starting five of Brunson, Hart, Bridges, Anunoby, and Towns. Brunson led the way with 12 points on 5-of-11 shooting, including two of four from deep. Towns chipped in 10 points, mostly from the free-throw line, but flashed his range with a trailing three-pointer from nearly 30 feet out, hinting at the offensive ceiling this group could reach once chemistry kicks in.\\nTowns shot 1-of-5 from beyond the arc, but as a career 40 percent shooter, expect him to regain his rhythm as the preseason unfolds.\\nLANDRY SHAMET MAKES A CASE\\nDespite being on a non-guaranteed training camp deal, Landry Shamet is pushing for a roster spot, and his performance on Sunday solidified his case.\\nThe career 38 percent three-point shooter contributed 16 points on 6-of-11 shooting, with four three-pointers, including a transition three that had Brunson hopping off the bench for a high-five. With the Knicks needing more off-guard options following Donte DiVincenzo 's departure, Shamet's shooting and two-way play could carve out significant minutes for him in Thibodeau's rotation.\\nMILES MCBRIDE CONTINUES TO IMPRESS\\nDeuce McBride followed up his breakout last season with a strong preseason debut, scoring a game-high 22 points on 8-of-18 shooting, including four three-pointers.\\nThe fourth-year guard displayed his usual tenacity on defense while also showing improved shot creation, getting to the rim off the dribble. His ability to stretch the floor and defend will likely secure him a key role in the rotation, especially with Thibodeau's emphasis on defense and shooting.\\nFRONTCOURT CONTRIBUTIONS FROM ACHIUWA AND SIMS\\nJericho Sims and Precious Achiuwa were key to the Knicks' interior presence, combining for solid production off the bench.\\nSims, who has visibly bulked up, grabbed 10 rebounds and made a Mitchell Robinson -like impact with his offensive board work, including a put-back dunk.\\nAchiuwa was all over the stat sheet with 15 points, five rebounds, two assists, two steals, and a block in a game-high 33 minutes. The Knicks had a +9.9 net rating with the Achiuwa-Sims pairing last season, and they picked up where they left off in Sunday's game.\\nROOKIE TYLER KOLEK SHINES\\nMarquette rookie Tyler Kolek made a strong impression in his Knicks debut. In the second half, Kolek scored 11 points on 3-of-5 shooting from beyond the arc, including a highlight play where he blocked a shot at the rim and then knocked down a transition three. His composure and ability to knock down shots could make him an intriguing piece as the Knicks look to develop their young talent.\\nQuite the find at pick No. 34.\\nWHAT'S NEXT\\nThe Knicks return to New York for two days of rest before hosting the Washington Wizards on Wednesday. Thibodeau is expected to gradually increase the starters' minutes leading up to the regular-season opener in Boston on Oct. 22.\",\n",

He reportedly knocked the woman down, bashed her head against a wall, pushed her down a flight of stairs and strangled her before throwing her out of the house.\\nHe was arrested at the scene without incident and purportedly nodded and said 'I know what is going on' after answering the door. He denied putting his hands on her but admitted they were arguing and he was trying to get her to leave, police said.\\nInside the home, police found a plastic bag containing a white powder which was later determined to be cocaine, police said.\\nPeppers, who turned 29 last Friday, was arraigned on Monday for assault and battery, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, strangulation and possession of a Class B substance believed to be cocaine, according to the Associated Press.\\nDuring the hearing, Peppers' attorney, Marc Brofsky, said there was evidence that 'sheds real doubt on the allegations.'\\nPeppers, who agreed to not have contact with the woman, posted $2,500 bail and is scheduled to appear in court again on Nov. 22.\\nPatriots head coach Jerod Mayo said the organization was aware of the situation and that Peppers would be allowed the at team facilities for the time being. Peppers, who also has a shoulder injury, was inactive for the team's 15-10 loss to the Miami Dolphins on Sunday. He had been ruled out prior to his arrest.\\n'We don't know enough to say he shouldn't be in the building,' Mayo told sports radio station WEEI on Monday. 'I don't think anyone knows the facts or anything like that. It's a process.'\\nPeppers, a team captain for the AFC East team, is in his third season with New England. He previously played for the Cleveland Browns and New York Giants. He played college football at Michigan. He signed a 3-year, $24 million contract extension with the Patriots over the summer.\",\n",

According to the Russians, he was captured two months later in the city of Izyum in eastern Ukraine.\\nRussian forces took control of Izyum in April 2022, but it was liberated in a Ukrainian counterattack in September 2022. However, that was too late to save Hubbard, who was behind bars in Russia the entire time.\\nHubbard's detention was unknown globally until September 2024, when his trial began in Russia. Prosecutors said he was paid $1,000 per month in exchange for fighting in the Ukrainian military, according to Reuters news service.\\nThough Hubbard pleaded guilty, his sister Patricia Hubbard Fox and another relative told Reuters they were skeptical of his confession.\\n'He is so non-military,' Fox told the outlet. 'He never had a gun, owned a gun, done any of that … He's more of a pacifist.'\\nHubbard had lived in Ukraine since 2014 and had few connections in the country, living off a small pension and never learning the language, Fox told Reuters.\\nHe is now one of several Americans sentenced to years in a Russian prison, even after a massive prisoner swap was completed in August between Russia and several Western nations.\\nAlso on Monday, one of those Americans behind bars, Robert Gilman, was sentenced to seven more years in prison for assaulting police officers, according to Russian media.\\nGilman, a former Marine, was first detained in 2022, after Russian authorities claimed he drunkenly attacked a cop on a train. He was sentenced to three years in that case, which paralleled Russia's account of another former Marine, Trevor Reed, who was released in a 2022 prisoner swap.\\nBut the Russians said Gilman also assaulted an officer during a routine prisoner checkup, and was given an additional seven years.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"As college campuses across New York City brace for pro-Palestinian protests on the anniversary of the Israel-Hamas war, Columbia University Monday boosted its security measures over what officials say is 'concern about the potential for violence.'\\nColumbia interim president Katrina Armstrong, in a message to students and faculty, said there's been 'rapidly increasing evidence' their main campus in Morningside Heights is a 'major focus for protest and other activity.' In response, the university suddenly blocked guests from accessing campus — breaking with a QR-code system that had been in place for approved visitors — and increased public safety personnel, she announced.\\n'We have several student groups planning for special events and non-violent protests and are working diligently to support those plans,' Armstrong wrote in a statement released just after midnight. 'At the same time, we have also learned and had evidence of plans of groups not affiliated with Columbia choosing to come to our Morningside campus for activities that raise concern about the potential for violence.'\\nStudents from more than a dozen local college campuses are planning to walk out of class and head to Washington Square Park, before joining a larger citywide protest organized by the pro-Palestinian group Within Our Lifetime. The organization was originally formed by local students at the City University of New York.\\nColumbia University students, flyers show, are planning to leave class a few hours before the main protest for the steps of Low Library. The campus remains closed to the public and accessible only to student and faculty. Preauthorized guests at the eleventh hour were booted from campus access.\\nIn a series of social media posts, protesters said they picketed the Brooklyn residence of NYPD Deputy Commissioner of Counterterrorism Rebecca Weiner. One of the protesters wearing a Columbia sweatshirt held a sign, saying: 'Revenge for Hind's Hall,' the name protesters gave to Columbia's occupied Hamilton Hall.\\nThe demonstration, the posts said, was scheduled for 'the anniversary of the glorious Al-Aqsa Flood,' which killed more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took 251 more hostage, according to Israeli official figures. Israel, in turn, launched an invasion that has since resulted in the deaths of more than 40,000 Palestinians in Gaza, more than half of whom were women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.\\nFor days, student-protesters at Columbia have been reading the names of Palestinians killed during Israel's war in Gaza in the center of campus. Meanwhile, Jewish students are also hosting events and demonstrations, including a screening of a documentary on the events of Oct. 7, an art installation, and a vigil where students will say Hebrew prayers for loss.\\nArmstrong replaced former university President Minouche Shafik, who resigned after coming under fire for her handling of several weeks of tense pro-Palestinian protests in the spring.\\nOriginally Published: October 7, 2024 at 11:56 a.m.\",\n",

Greco was spotted at City Hall on Friday, at one point appearing comforted by Ingrid Lewis-Martin, chief advisor to Adams. Their heads were lowered and Lewis-Martin rested a hand on Greco's shoulder as they left the building.\\nMohammed Bahi, Senior Muslim Liaison to the mayor, resigned from his post effective Monday, a source close to the matter said. And Ahsan Chughtai, a senior advisor for South Asian and Muslim affairs, was also fired within the past couple weeks, multiple sources said.\\n'Both Winnie Greco and Mohamed Bahi today tendered their resignations. We thank them for their service to the city,' Fabien Levy, a spokesperson for Adams said.\\nAbbasova had been placed on unpaid leave after the feds raided her home last year in connection with the probe looking into whether Adams accepted and solicited bribes and illegal campaign contributions from the government of Turkey and its associates, carrying out favors in return.\\nProsecutors say Abbasova, who is not named in the five-count criminal indictment, coordinated with Turkish officials to set up straw donations and travel upgrades for Adams. She is cooperating with federal authorities and is considered a key witness against Adams, The News previously reported.\\nAdams, who was indicted in the case late last month, has pleaded not guility to the charges.\\nRachel Maimin, Abbasova's attorney, declined to comment.\\nGreco's Pelham Bay homes were raided in February, though the exact nature of that investigation remains unclear.\\nChughtai has been an influential Adams campaign surrogate in the city's Pakistani communities, and he also donated $1,000 to the mayor's reelection campaign in June 2023, records show.\\nThe news comes just hours after news broke early Monday that Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Phil Banks resigned over the weekend.\\nHe is one of five top Adams advisers who had their homes raided and electronics seized on Sept. 4 as part of several federal corruption investigations. Previously, Schools Chancellor David Banks, senior Adams adviser Tim Pearson and NYPD Commissioner Edward Caban, all who were raided that day, had already announced their resignations.\\nOriginally Published: October 7, 2024 at 6:23 p.m.\",\n",

David Paterson and his stepson — son of Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa — during a bizarre late-night quarrel on the Upper East Side are claiming they are the true victims.\\nTravor Nurse and Diamond Minter were arraigned in Manhattan Criminal Court Tuesday, where their lawyers presented a starkly different take on the clash late Friday outside a McDonald's on Second Ave near E. 96th St.\\nAssistant District Attorney Zachary Campbell said 20-year-old Anthony Sliwa first encountered a group of youths earlier in the night while walking his dog and argued with them for attempting to climb a fire escape outside his building.\\nLater that night, while out walking with Paterson, the prosecutor said, Sliwa re-encountered the group by the fast food restaurant and got into another argument, at which point two NYCHA employees, Nurse and Minter, 'took it upon themselves to intervene.'\\nCampbell said that Sliwa shoved Nurse, 40, into a vestibule, then traded swings with him and Minter, 34.\\nNurse allegedly then threw Sliwa to the ground, and two young boys, aged 12 and 13 — who have since been charged in family court — began kicking and stomping on him as Minter allegedly held back Sliwa's arms while he struggled to defend himself.\\nWhen the fight began to fizzle out, Nurse started to walk away, only to turn back and smack Paterson in the back of the head with a closed fist, sending him crashing to the ground, the prosecutor said.\\nNurse then swung again at Sliwa, who had just gotten up from the ground, Campbell said.\\nSliwa, whose mother, Mary Paterson, was previously married to the Guardian Angels founder and Republican candidate for mayor, was taken to New York-Presbyterian Hospital Weill Cornell and treated for pain to his face. He needed stitches for a bust lip. Paterson, 70, New York's first Black governor, who served from 2008 to 2010, was treated for pain to his head, according to court docs.\\nNurse's lawyer, Jeff Chabrowe, vehemently protested his client's innocence and said Nurse walked away from the dustup with more severe injuries than anyone involved — dislocating his shoulder in four places and suffering a large gash above his eye.\\nChabrowe referenced a detailed radio interview Paterson, who is legally blilnd, gave on Monday in which he referenced his stepson's black belt in jiu-jitsu and described Sliwa slamming one of the juvenile's heads into a window.\\n'He was able to defend himself quite successfully,' Chabrowe said in court.\\nMinter's public defender, Zachary Wechsler, said his client has no criminal record and intervened when she saw two adults accosting children.\\nProsecutors charged Nurse with one count of assault and Minter with two counts. Manhattan Criminal Court Judge Pamela Goldsmith set Nurse's bail at $50,000 bond and released Minter on supervised release. She issued orders of protection mandating they stay away from the former governor and his stepson.\\nThe DA's office is expected to present the case to a grand jury on Friday.\\nAfter the hearing, Chabrowe told the Daily News Sliwa was the primary assailant and that his client was attempting to come to the children's aid.\\n'My client arrived after the fact, when former Governor Paterson and Mr. Sliwa were already in a confrontation with some juveniles, and was trying to act as a peacemaker when Mr. Sliwa attacked him,' Chabrowe.\\n'I'm confident that after further investigation, the DA's office will certainly see this and we look forward to clearing his name.'\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Australian airline Qantas has its tail between its legs after inadvertently playing an R-rated movie on every screen.\\nA technical issue precluded passengers from choosing their own in-flight entertainment en route from Sydney to Tokyo last week. The crew chose one film — the R-rated film ' Daddio,' according to multiple reports on social media— to play for everyone including young passengers, according to a statement the airline provided to CNN.\\n'Our crew members had a limited list of movies that they were able to play across all screens on the aircraft and based on the request from a number of passengers, a particular movie was selected for the entire flight,' says the statement.\\nThe airline added that it tried to fix screens for passengers, 'particularly those who had complained about the content,' but to no avail.\\n'The movie was clearly not suitable to play for the whole flight and we sincerely apologize to customers for this experience,' an airline spokesperson told the outlet, adding that the film was ultimately replaced by 'a family friendly movie … which is our standard practice for the rare cases where individual movie selection isn't possible.'\\nThe airline said it's currently reviewing how the R-rated film was chosen.\\nReddit users remarking on the incident have pointed to the Dakota Johnson-Sean Penn flick as the 'extremely inappropriate' film in question.\\nThe two-hander drama stars Johnson as the passenger in Penn's late night cab from JFK. During the ride, the pair discuss their lives, trials and tribulations in great, and often explicit, detail. The film also features recurring glimpses at Johnson's phone and the sexts she's sending and receiving, both written and visual. (AV Club described the Qantas incident as 'Airline apologizes for foisting unsolicited 'Daddio' d–k pic on innocent passengers.')\\n'It featured graphic nudity and a lot of sexting — the kind where you could literally read the texts on screen without needing headphones,' said one Reddit user, who attached pictures of said texts. 'It took almost an hour of this before they switched to a more kid-friendly movie, but it was super uncomfortable for everyone, especially with families and kids onboard.'\",\n",

Church workers recovered the broken hands, which were steepled in prayer, and hope to reaffix them to the statue.\\n'She survived,' Pastor Victor Bolaños told The News of the damaged statue. 'Only humility can survive any attack. Mary is humble — so humility can absorb the pain and the violence of the others. Even though the hands were removed, they will go back.

Later, she'photobombed' herself when she partied alongside fellow Chiefs WAG Chariah Gordon in front of the Chiefs suite's Eras Tour poster.\\n'How do you feel after this win?' asked Gordon, who is engaged to wide receiver Mecole Hardman Jr.\\n'It's important that you answer the question this time,' said the 'cardigan' singer, holding out her drink\\n'I think that we feel really good after this win,' says Gordon, as Swift announces the team — which is thus far undefeated this season — is heading into a league bye week.\\n'Perfect is the word,' Swift agrees, before catching where she's standing and turning toward the poster: 'Me photobombing myself.'\\nBoth the Chiefs and Swift are enjoying some time off, so Swift and Kelce might actually have some time together before she returns to the stage Friday, Oct. 18 in Miami.\\nThe Chiefs will then face off Oct. 20 against the San Francisco 49ers, who they overtook during this year's Super Bowl, which Swift also attended.\\nEarly last month, a hoax 'breakup PR plan' circulated. The fake document alleged that the pair's love story was not only a PR stunt but was scheduled to end on Sept. 28. Though Kelce's reps swiftly dismissed the doc as a forgery, onlookers began to wonder if there was some truth to it when Swift skipped the Chiefs' away games against the Atlanta Falcons on Sept. 22 and the Los Angeles Chargers on Sept. 29, as well as Kelce's birthday celebration this past weekend.\\n'Nothing has changed' for the couple, as a source told Us Weekly last week, insisting the pair is 'spending as much time together as possible' amid busy schedules.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Remember Oct. 7 by reflecting on what led to it\\nBronx: Israel supporters had a field day on Monday. They pleaded for sympathy with no acknowledgment of Israel's bad behavior. First, Voicer Bruce Ticker played dumb about Israel's atrocities and wanted accusations 'backed up with facts.' In past letters, I have done exactly that. So, I see no need to repeat those facts again. Bruce just wants to be unaware.\\nThen, Voicer Holly Rothkopf dragged out boring clichés about phony antisemitism. She thinks Israelis are blameless for bad things that happened to them one year ago. She should try behaving badly in a bar, and then she can wonder why she got a bloody nose. Last year, Israel's awful behavior had consequences. It got a very bloody nose.\\nJoshua Davidson (' A prayer for peace for this Jewish New Year,' op-ed, Oct. 7) grudgingly conceded that 'settler hooligans attack Palestinians,' (photo) but he didn't act as if that was any big deal because Arabs don't really matter. In my more cynical moments, I wonder if Zionist pundits matriculate in advanced Ph.D. programs that teach them how to gaslight to maximum advantage.\\nFor a long time, Palestinians have lived miserably under Zionists. What Israelis learned a year ago was that it is their turn to live miserably. And it will get even more miserable for them as corporations won't want to invest in such a miserable place. That, and not Iranian missiles, may be their undoing. Nick Smith\\nHave a heart\\nPark Ridge, N.J.: I think many people would have a lot more sympathy for the plight of the Palestinians if, on the anniversary of the slaughter of so many innocent people in Israel, the pro-Palestinian demonstrators showed a little sympathy for them. We're in this world together. There's no place else to go. Steve Ostlund\\nNot your forté\\nBrooklyn: President Biden's call for a ceasefire in Israel's fight against terrorism seems a little beyond his scope of expertise. Biden, the one who orchestrated our disastrous pullout from Afghanistan, is telling Israel, which has kept its enemies at bay for decades, how to handle a war. That's like Bernie Madoff telling Elon Musk how to run a business. Biden should stick to what he's good at: drinking tequila on the beach. Josh Greenberger\\nElect responsibly\\nTamarac, Fla.: This is not the time to elect a president who needs to be spoon-fed to run a country. Kamala Harris and the progressive leadership can be perilous to America because they are based on control before country. The ideology progressives live by, in contrast to our own, will weaken the country in no time because they simply do not like nor agree with the American way. Decision-making is crucial when we cast our votes, and there is very little room for error, especially now as we witness our country deal with overwhelming amounts of internal and worldwide problems. You are urged to think very carefully before voting for your next president of the United States. If you love your country, you must vote to hold onto it before it is too late. Roberta Chaleff\\nCheck your sources\\nRidgewood: To Voicer Robert Brennan: It's only the malicious internet rumor mill that is fueling the idea that the federal government is not responding fully to the Hurricane Helene disaster. Despite Donald Trump's claims, both North Carolina's Democratic governor and Republican Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp have praised the federal response and the availability of President Biden, who has sent active-duty troops to supplement state efforts. One particularly ridiculous claim is that Democrats — or maybe it's the Jews, in a classic antisemitic trope — control the weather. It's the Biden-Harris administration that has made major investments in our ability to fight climate change while providing hundreds of thousands of jobs. FEMA is running out of money not because it's funding migrants, a bizarre claim, but because Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson blocked further funding and won't call a special session to deal with this crisis. Chandra Bocci\\n'Right' is wrong\\nBrooklyn: Please stop referring to anyone who doesn't agree with open borders, unisex bathrooms, defund the police and every other off-the-wall policy that progressives take up as 'right wing.' Your publication, as well as many others, too often use the term as a sort of slander against anyone who doesn't follow your preferred political ideologies. The more accurate term for these people would be 'common-sense voters.' Jack Flynn\\nShow up\\nPhoenix: We are writing this letter to request that everyone takes the time to vote in the 2024 election. The beauty of casting your ballot is only possible when everyone votes for the candidate of their choice so that the majority's voice is heard. As we have cast our votes consistently over the past six decades in each election, we have witnessed the results, whether we agree or disagree. When constituents do not take the time to go to the polls, they are often dissatisfied with the results. It is imperative to the life of our republic that we take the time to cast our ballot and let our voices be heard! Should you choose not to vote, you should not harbor ill feelings if you believe the election was swayed in a way that you do not approve. Whatever your choice, take time to vote. John and Roberta Walgren\\nRecords request\\nBronx: In an effort to show he is still able to govern New York City effectively, Mayor Adams announced he is replacing the tables and chairs at City Hall with furniture from IKEA. Could the file cabinets be going? Fred Smith\\nParadise lost\\nManhattan: The countdown to closure has ostensibly begun for the Elizabeth Street Garden, the exotic, one-acre Eden in Nolita. Mayor Adams, seemingly undistracted by legal woes that may torpedo his administration, has served the fabled sculpture garden an eviction notice. The city is determined to scrap the popular park in favor of affordable housing — despite Elizabeth Street Garden reps having pointed out numerous alternative sites for housing development right in the neighborhood. At the same time, the Department of Transportation is touting the idea of creating pedestrian-friendly green space on the median of Park Ave. Wow, talk about a clown show in action. Susan M. Silver\\nHard fall\\nGreenville, S.C.: Sad fallout from the arrest and jail developments for rap mogul Sean 'P. Diddy' Combs! On Sept. 9, the hip-hop star was charged with sex trafficking and racketeering by a federal grand jury in New York. It was even demanded that he pay a judgment of $100 million to Derrick Lee Cardello-Smith, who accused Combs of drugging and sexually assaulting him 30 years ago. This is some bad mess right here! I know your mama, Janice Combs, and his female cousins and sisters, who I know he loves, are crying their damn hearts out about this! How could a person who was riding high have a fall from grace so low after being one of the most powerful rappers in the hip-hop industry? This punk is soon to get the verdict from the court and be locked up in jail for a long time. Steven Hawkins\\nBetter prevention\\nYorktown Heights, N.Y.: Thank you for your editorial ' Curbside composting curbs rats ' (Oct. 6). It was nice to see that organic collection resulted in benefits such as elimination of trash's odor in households and buildings and reduction of garbage in the city. The airtight, rodent-impervious bins with locking covers should reduce the presence of rats, who stay and multiply where food is available. Hopefully, this type of cleanliness will also be a step toward eliminating glue traps, which cause severe and prolonged agony. During futile attempts to escape, animals have their skin, fur or feathers ripped off. Organs get injured, bones get broken and animals chew through limbs. All this suffering can last for days until the animal dies from shock, blood loss or dehydration. This barbarity is why many stores stopped selling glue traps and many countries made them illegal. I hope America is next.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"On this somber day, what speech goes too far?\\nManhattan: Today, while decent people are mourning the Hamas terrorist attack, there are multiple planned demonstrations in our city organized by the group Within Our Lifetime. WOL is calling the event 'Flood NYC for Palestine.' The name references the barbaric massacre that was called 'Operation Al Aqsa Flood' by its perpetrators. Even the name of this event is meant to terrorize.\\nWOL is a pro-terror, antisemitic organization that echoes Hamas tropes and routinely calls for the destruction of Israel. WOL endorsed the Oct. 7 attacks, and its leader, Nerdeen Kiswani, openly supports Hamas, a terrorist organization bent on the destruction of Israel and murder of Jews. During their demonstrations, this group marches with banners proclaiming 'By any means necessary!' and reciting chants such as 'Globalize the intifada!' Thousands attend, calling for the destruction of the Jewish state and the targeting of 'Zionists' worldwide. Their speech incites violence and hatred and should not be included under the umbrella of free speech. This is designed to justify the killing of Jews.\\nThe impact of the atrocities committed on Oct. 7, 2023 is felt by the global Jewish community and all Americans. While I look toward a more hopeful future, on this anniversary, I worry about the hostages still held by Hamas. I think about the courage of those on the frontlines fighting terrorism, from the IDF in Gaza searching tunnels to our brave U.S. soldiers confronting ISIS in Iraq and Syria. I am angry that there are protesters on our streets and campuses proudly supporting Islamist terrorists rather than condemning them and demanding the release of the hostages. Holly Rothkopf\\nAccording to whom?\\nPhiladelphia: Horrifying to learn that Palestinians are being 'raped to death with objects by Israeli prison guards,' as Voicer Jessica Caban claims. What is she talking about? Where does she get this stuff? Is it from a new placard replacing 'From the river to the sea?' As usual, she offers a wild accusation without backing it up with any facts. Bruce S. Ticker\\nDubious descriptors?\\nNew Rochelle, N.Y.: As a daily reader and subscriber, I notice that some writers on the 'Be Our Guest' op-eds have more titles than body, but I wonder what they really do. Not to mention, most of them are authors trying to sell books. Charlie Morales\\nDeserved and overdue\\nBrooklyn: I think it is time to forgive Pete Rose for his wrongdoings. His family deserves a celebration of his accomplishments with his induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame. In my eyes, he was always the leader, all-time hits, among other accomplishments. Karl Stults\\nPassing costs\\nMassapequa, L.I.: I agree with Voicer Virgilio Carballo about congestion pricing, but I think the manufacturers of the products delivered by trucking companies will raise their prices to compensate for the extra delivery expenses, so I fear all consumers in the U.S. will be paying more for those products. Jean Marie Chiaramonte\\nShortage fear\\nMassapequa, L.I.: To Voicer Dennis Pascale: I really don't think Stop & Shop was playing games during the port strike. Did you see the lines outside of Costco? People were panicking and starting to hoard items just like they were during the pandemic. Judi Bruch\\nWon't work\\nBronx: I want to thank James F. McShane for his thought-provoking article (' Congestion pricing is not the (complete) answer,' op-ed, Oct. 3). His argument showed why congestion pricing won't solve the problem. With cutting down lanes of traffic for bus and bike lanes, reducing places where you can drive, how would congestion pricing reduce time for emergency vehicles to operate? Answer: They can't. I always thought congestion pricing is just a cash grab, but this puts it in a different perspective. Martin Sandok\\nPoorly planned\\nLong Island City: Congratulations to James McShane, the retired NYPD chief who served six years as the executive/commanding officer of the Traffic Control Division. His op-ed on traffic problems in Manhattan was the most intelligent, insightful piece on the problem that I have ever seen. We need thoughtful people like McShane addressing our problems rather than the 'consortium of local Brooklyn elected officials' referenced in your article in the same edition of The News on the plan to reconfigure McGuinness Blvd. in Greenpoint (' U-turn on B'klyn road bid,' Oct. 3). That plan is a total disaster that is poorly conceived and designed, and is opposed by most long-time Greenpoint residents and businesses. I ride my bike over the Pulaski Bridge almost every day. The section the Department of Transportation has already reconfigured at the bottom of the bridge in Greenpoint now makes it incredibly dangerous for cyclists exiting the bridge onto local streets. Another example of incompetent planning. Paul Camilleri\\nCould be worse\\nBrooklyn: While I'm not a big fan of this current mayor and his nepotistic ways, keep in mind that if he's forced out, who takes over: the king of 'defund the police' and no-bail, Jumaane Williams (whose best friend is AOC ). Watch the city burn to the ground! Rocco Conte\\nVisionary reversal\\nTarrytown, N.Y.: Over the weekend, a dangerous new version of MAGA was created: Musk And Gullible Airheads. We now have one of the richest, most powerful and influential men in the world bowing to the orange grifter. This migrant carries 200 million followers and is now posting dangerous and ridiculous falsehoods daily. His tweet in 2022 was, 'I do not hate the man but it's time for Trump to hang up his hat & sail into the sunset.' Remember, Elon Musk has only been an American citizen since 2002 and has always voted Democrat. It all started with him being snubbed for the EV summit by President Biden. It also did not help that he is fighting his workers who want to unionize and his many shoddy employment practices. Does he not realize that it's the Democratic Party that believes in climate change, electric vehicles and space exploration? Stephen Talenti\\nPetty ex-prez\\nManhattan: Will someone please explain to me why Biden and all the former presidents wished Jimmy Carter a happy 100th birthday except for one, of course: Donald J. Trump. George W. Bush was gracious, Barack Obama was cool and the rest of them said lovely things. Why couldn't this narcissistic sociopath just once say something nice about someone else? Instead, he was filmed making snide remarks. Do we really want this self-absorbed clown to have his finger on the button? Joie Anderson\\nHouse purview\\nManhattan: It is a shame that a know-nothing reader like Voicer Michael P. Devine blames the Biden administration for a possible shortfall of funds in FEMA due to aid to Ukraine. His lack of knowledge shows up in his letter because he probably supports the felon Trump. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives allocates funds to FEMA. The House controls the purse strings. If FEMA is short on funds, it is the fault of the Republican-controlled House, Mr. Devine, not the fault of Biden. But of course, who would expect a supporter of the convicted felon Trump to know that fact? Richard Simon\\nDishonest dept. head\\nWhitestone: Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is a despicable human being. This man has the audacity to tell the residents of North Carolina that there is not enough money to aid them after the disaster they just experienced. These poor people are offered just $750 for groceries to start. It's pretty apparent that the money has been mismanaged and this secretary does not know how to run a very important department. This smug man lied before Congress and lied to the American people. The Justice Department should bring him up on charges and he should be dealt with through the criminal justice system. Gene O'Brien\\nHistory bears proof\\nFreeport, L.I.: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene has good reason to be concerned about criminals immigrating to the United States. Britain emptied Newgate Prison for people to settle Georgia, and look how that turned out. Bob Sterner\",\n",

Additionally, an 8- to 12-foot storm surge was predicted in Tampa Bay.\\nA large swath of Florida's gulf coast was under a hurricane watch Monday, from Sewanee (100 miles north of Tampa) to Chokoloskee (across the peninsula from Miami).\\nFlorida officials began warning residents on Sunday that many would be ordered to evacuate.\\n'I don't think there's any scenario where we don't have major impacts at this point,' Gov. Ron DeSantis said. 'If you're on that west coast of Florida, barrier islands, just assume you'll be asked to leave.'\\nOn Monday, Milton remained in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico, near the Yucatan Peninsula, and traveled 9 mph eastward across the water, according to the National Hurricane Center.\\nParts of the state were still recovering from Hurricane Helene, which made landfall as a Category 4 storm on Sept. 26 in the Big Bend region, where the peninsula meets the panhandle. At least 20 people in Florida were killed by Helene, some of the more than 230 people who died nationwide in the storm.\\nFlorida's emergency management leader, Kevin Guthrie, said his department was planning for the largest evacuation since Hurricane Irma in 2017, when 7 million people were told to leave. That storm also made landfall as a Category 4 and killed 92 people in the mainland U.S.\\nDeSantis declared a state of emergency in 51 of Florida's 67 counties, including the major population centers of Broward, Duval, Hillsborough, Miami-Dade, Orange, Palm Beach and Pinellas.\\n'This is not a good track for the state of Florida,' DeSantis said Sunday.\\nMilton was an unusual storm because it formed in the western Gulf of Mexico and tracked east toward Florida, according to meteorologists. Most storms that hit Florida in October form in the Caribbean Sea.\\nThe storm was predicted to travel straight across Florida and out to sea, leaving other areas impacted by Helene — Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, communities in the Appalachian Mountains — safe to continue digging out from the wreckage.\\nOriginally Published: October 7, 2024 at 12:38 p.m.\",\n",

Kelly on his conviction and 20-year sentence for child sex crimes in Chicago.\\nKelly, 57, has lost every appeal in the case since he was convicted in September 2022 on three counts of producing child sexual abuse images and three counts of enticing minors for sex.\\nThe Supreme Court justices provided no explanation for their decision — as is customary — and none publicly dissented.\\nKelly's legal team argued in its appeals that his conviction violated the statute of limitations. Federal laws passed in 2003 allow child victims of sex assault to come forward at any time during their lives. Kelly's team argued the conduct he was convicted of occurred in the 1990s.\\n'No statute of limitations saves him, and the resulting sentence was procedurally proper and — especially under these appalling circumstances — substantively fair,' the 7th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals wrote in rejecting Kelly's attempt earlier this year to get the conviction tossed.\\nKelly has also appealed his sex trafficking and racketeering convictions in New York, along with their 30-year prison sentence. The Supreme Court did not rule Monday on that case.\\nAfter years as a music superstar, Kelly was indicted in New York and Chicago in 2019. His New York case was handled first, and he was convicted in September 2021 on nine counts of violating the Mann Act and the RICO Act. The next year, he was sentenced to 30 years behind bars.\\nAfter that case, Kelly stood trial in Chicago, where a woman described how he had groomed and abused her while she was 14 years old. In September 2022, he was convicted in that case, and the next year he was sentenced to 20 years in prison, to run concurrently with his New York sentence.\\nPrior to the criminal cases, Kelly had been publicly accused of having relationships with underage girls. He was charged with child pornography in Chicago in 2002 but acquitted at trial in 2008.\\nAdditionally, Kelly attempted to marry the singer Aaliyah in 1994 when she was 15 years old and he was 27, but the marriage was annulled because of Aaliyah's age.\\nThe later criminal investigations began after a documentary, ' Surviving R. Kelly,' was released in January 2019. Kelly, whose legal first name is Robert, has consistently denied all the allegations.\\nThe Supreme Court began its 2024-25 term on Monday and rejected several notable appeals, including another from notorious pharmaceutical executive Martin Shkreli.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Richard Simmons is 'sweatin' to the oldies' in his final resting place. The eccentric fitness guru, who died July 13 at age 76, was buried in his famous workout gear.\\nThat little known detail was revealed during a memorial service honoring Simmons over the weekend by his brother, Lenny Simmons.\\n'Just like Clark Kent, underneath his clothing, he is wearing a tank top and shorts,' he told mourners at St. Louis Cathedral in New Orleans on Saturday. 'Why, you ask? Because we think that God has another plan for him, and we made sure that he was going to be in his normal costume that we all know and love to help the saints and the angels get into shape.'\\nHe added, 'I'm here to say to you that even though he's not here, and I know he's in spirit here tonight, Richard Simmons will forever be sweating with the holies.'\\nOne day after celebrating his 76th birthday, Simmons was found dead at his Hollywood Hills home on the morning of July 13. He had reportedly felt dizzy and fallen in his bathroom but declined to seek medical attention, telling his housekeeper he would go to the doctor the next day if he didn't feel better.\\nWeeks later, family spokesperson Tom Estey said the Los Angeles Coroner's office confirmed that the cause of death was accidental due to complications from recent falls and heart disease as a contributing factor. The toxicology report was negative 'other than medication Richard had been prescribed.'\\nBorn Milton Teagle Simmons in New Orleans in 1948, he became a pop culture phenomenon with his 'Sweatin' to the Oldies' workout video series, diet and exercise books and by hosting the Emmy Award-winning 'The Richard Simmons Show' from 1980-84.\",\n",

Pearson said to a guard before grabbing her neck and shoving her into a counter, according to the suit, filed Monday in Manhattan Supreme Court. The complaint also names the city, the NYPD and other defendants.\\nThe suit alleges the three Arrow Security employees, Terrence Rosenthal, Leesha Bell and Angelica Weldon, approached Pearson and NYPD Detective Joseph Raffaelle last October, asking them for identification as they attempted to enter the 31st St. shelter.\\nPearson then attacked Bell, cursing at her and gripping her neck, according to the complaint. He then lunged at Weldon, pushing her into a wall and onto the floor, and then with Raffaelle, Vitucci and another NYPD officer, threw Rosenthal to the ground.\\n'The City of New York and Mayor Eric Adams knew Timothy Pearson was not qualified to serve in his administration and despite continued substantiated allegations of misconduct and knowing he posed a risk to the safety of others, they continued his employment and unnecessarily endangered the public,' \\u200b\\u200bJason Steinberger, attorney for all three guards, said in a statement.\\nDiffering reports emerged after the October 2023 incident — with police sources telling the Daily News the guards decided to 'exceed their authority' and that Pearson was the one shoved by them. Pearson, who was conducting a quality assurance spot inspection, was wearing a jacket that identified him as a senior advisor to the mayor and was accompanied by uniformed NYPD officers.\\nPearson was not charged. Both Bell and Rosenthal were arrested and held at a police precinct the day of the incident. Their charges were eventually dropped by the Manhattan district attorney's office.\\nThe suit is seeking monetary damages and attorney's fees for physical and emotional abuse, false arrest and imprisonment and malicious prosecution.\\nThe Law Department is bankrolling Pearson in several sexual harassment lawsuits. John Flannery, who represents Pearson in those suits, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did Hugh Mo, Pearson's criminal lawyer. Nicholas Paolucci, a spokesman for the city's Law Department, declined to comment.\\nThe lawsuit says the guards didn't subject Pearson to any physical contact.\\nPearson resigned from Adams' administration last week after the mayor was indicted in a federal investigation on charges he accepted and solicited bribes from the Turkish government.\\nThe former aide is caught up in a separate federal corruption probe as one of multiple top aides to the mayor who had their homes raided and electronics seized by federal investigators in September as part of several ongoing corruption probes.\\nMolly Shaeffer, who worked closely with Pearson managing the city's migrant services contracts as the city's director of the Office of Asylum Seekers, was subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury last month.\",\n",

The caffeine level was roughly four times as much as a cup of coffee or Red Bull.\\nThe restaurant and beverages have been blamed for the death of Dennis Brown, a 46-year-old Florida man, and for causing heart injuries in previously healthy people in three other lawsuits. Those lawsuits are still pending.\\nTerms of the settlement were not made public. Jury selection had been scheduled for this week.\\nIn response to the lawsuits and injury complaints, the company vowed to investigate the matter and added warnings to the beverage's cup labels and more signage about its caffein content and nutritional information. At one point, it moved the Charged Lemonades behind the counter so customers could not serve themselves.\",\n",

But rapes are up 14%, robberies are up 1% and felony assaults are up 5%.\\nChief of Crime Control Strategies Michael Lipetri blamed the increase in felony assaults on the jump in domestic violence and stranger attacks, plus a spike in assaults against police officers. In the third quarter of the year, he noted, there were 36 more domestic violence assaults than in the second quarter, with corresponding increases in stranger attacks, 60, and assaults on officers, 75.\\nThe NYPD also answered criticism from its federal monitor, Mylan Denerstein, who in a report issued Monday said an analysis of 2023 body-worn camera footage shows that cops filled out the required reports for only 59% of the stops analyzed. That's less than the 69% found in a 2022 analysis.\\n'The NYPD appears to be headed in the wrong direction and must take immediate steps, including discipline when appropriate, to correct this failure to properly document [stops],' the report said.\\nChief of Patrol John Chell acknowledged that the issue is critical to building trust in communities and helping to drive crime down further.\\nHe noted that ComplianceStat, in which police officials analyze stops caught on police body-worn cameras, is a way to bring officers in line with their reporting obligations.\\n'We're doing a good job in this — but we still have work to be done,' he said. 'It's being addressed. It's building the trust…and we're being as transparent as we can to fix a problem that was kind of not dealt with for years until this.'\",\n",

'Today's guilty plea should send a message that SDNY is committed to holding our public officials accountable when they resort to corruption.'\\nThe two chiefs — who oversaw safety inspections for large city buildings and projects as the head of the FDNY's Bureau of Fire Prevention — exploited a backlog of inspections during the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic and agreed to bump paying developers to the top of the line.\\nThe pivotal FDNY bureau is responsible for overseeing and approving the installation of fire safety and suppression systems in commercial and residential buildings throughout the city and making sure they are in compliance with fire safety regulations.\\nA failed or delayed inspection by the BFP could prevent a building from being opened to the public, officials said.\\nThe two ran the scam with retired Firefighter Henry Santiago from 2021 through last year, officials said. The kickbacks added to Saccavino's $263,478 salary in 2023 and Cordasco's $257,296 yearly take-home pay, prosecutors said.\\nAs they carried out their scam, Cordasco lied to other BFP members to justify otherwise improper expediting requests, federal prosecutors said. He also lied to law enforcement when interviewed about his involvement in the scheme.\\nConcerns of the bribe taking were first made by FDNY administrators to the city's Department of Investigation, which began a probe that soon included the FBI and U.S. Attorney's office.\\n'This former chief of the Bureau of Fire Prevention chose to ignore his responsibility to the city and its taxpayers when he took thousands of dollars in bribes in exchange for expediting certain fire reviews and inspections,' DOI Commissioner Jocelyn Strauber added.\\nThe two chiefs were placed on modified assignment and were not allowed to take part in any inspections in February, around the same time the FBI raided their homes for evidence. The two had retired from the FDNY when criminal charges were filed against them in September.\\nCordasco pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to solicit and receive a bribe, which carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison, officials said. He'll be sentenced on Feb. 19.\\nSaccavino maintains his innocence and has not indicated that he plans to plead out.\\nThe case was brought in the leadup to the Manhattan U.S. attorney's case against Mayor Adams, which partly alleges he accepted bribes from the Turkish government to circumvent fire safety checks at Turkey's consulate in Manhattan.\\nThe feds have not drawn a line between the two cases.\\nOriginally Published: October 8, 2024 at 1:09 p.m.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Nell Smith, a rising musician known for her collaborations with the Flaming Lips, has died. She was 17.\\nA cause of death has yet to be revealed but during the the psychedelic rock band's concert on Sunday in Portland, Ore., frontman Wayne Coyne shared the sad news: 'We got some very sad messages today that she was killed in a car accident last night, and we're reminded once again of the power of music.'\\nThe Canadian singer's family confirmed her death in an Instagram comment on Monday.\\n'It pains us so much to say that our feisty, talented, unique, beautiful daughter was cruelly taken from us on Saturday night,' the post stated. 'We are reeling from the news and don't know what to do or say.'\\nThe family continued: 'She had so much more to experience and to give this world but we are grateful that she got to experience so very much in her 17 years. She has left an indelible mark on the word and an unfillable chasm in our hearts. Hold your kids extra tight tonight and for now please leave us to work through things. We will shout when we need you. Jude, Rachel, Jed and Ike x.'\\nSmith was set to release her debut solo album on the Bella Union record label in 2025. The album was to be a follow-up to her 2021 collaboration wit the Flaming Lips on an album of Nick Cave covers, titled 'Where the Viaduct Looms. '\\nThe record company's cofounder Simon Raymonde, the former bassist for the Cocteau Twins, wrote on Instagram about being ' shocked and devastated to hear of the sudden and tragic passing of our artist and dear friend.'\\nThe teen prodigy, who developed a friendship with the Flaming Lips in 2018, was set to record with the group when the COVID-19 pandemic put the world on lockdown. The 'She Don't Use Jelly' rockers went on to produce the project remotely.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"The woman who is suing WWE and its former head, Vince McMahon, accusing him of graphic sexual abuse and trafficking, has requested that all former and current employees be released from any non-disclosure agreements they may have signed while working with the wrestling entertainment company.\\nAttorney Ann Callis made the demand on behalf of her client, Janel Grant, in a letter sent late Monday to attorneys for WWE President Nick Khan, WWE Chief Content Officer Paul 'Triple H' Levesque, and Ari Emanuel, the CEO of Endeavor, which is WWE's parent company. It comes nearly six months after Grant, who was a WWE employee for three years, filed her lawsuit, which prompted McMahon to resign as executive chairman of the board of directors TKO Group Holdings.\\nBy then, he'd already stepped down as the company's CEO, a move made amid a 2022 investigation into claims that match those in Grant's lawsuit.\\n'If WWE and its parent company Endeavor are serious about parting ways with Vince McMahon and the toxic workplace culture he created, their executives should have no problem with releasing former WWE employees from their NDAs,' Callis said, adding that it could clear the way for additional victims to come forward.\\n' WWE cannot move on from its sordid past while its victims remain silenced. Survivors deserve an opportunity to share their experiences on their terms,' she continued. 'Forced silence only deepens the wounds of sexual abuse. Survivors are revictimized every time they are muzzled and forced to live in fear of attack from a multi-billion-dollar business that can hire an army of lawyers to bury them in legal fees if they speak the truth.'\\nMcMahon, who lived in Grant's building at the time, initially offered her a job in 2019 — but his proposal did not come without a set of seemingly implied conditions, according to the lawsuit.\\nWhile Grant believed she was building a professional relationship with the wrestling honcho, he soon made it clear she'd be required to engage in a physical relationship with him and others, including the show's talent and its former head of talent relations John Laurinaitis, who is also named in the suit. He previously wrestled under the name 'Johnny Ace.'\\nGrant goes on to detail graphic abuse she allegedly faced during her years at WWE.\\nIn May 2020, McMahon 'defecated on Ms. Grant during a threesome, and then commanded her to continue pleasuring his 'friend' — with feces in her hair and running down her back — while McMahon went to the bathroom to shower off,' the complaint said.\\nIn another incident at WWE headquarters, Grant said both McMahon and Laurinaitis forced her behind a locked door and sexually assaulted her.\\nIn the end, Grant claimed she was pressured to leave her job with the WWE and into signing a $3 million nondisclosure agreement, of which she only received $1 million.\\nMcMahon has since denied Grant's accusations, saying the suit is 'replete with lies, obscene made-up instances that never occurred, and a vindictive distortion of the truth.'\\n'He will vigorously defend himself,' the spokesperson added.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Hurricane Milton weakened overnight as it roared ever closer to Florida, but it is still poised to be one of the most devastating storms to hit the Tampa Bay area in more than 100 years.\\nMilton's maximum sustained winds reached 180 mph late Monday, then declined to 155 mph as the storm blew past Cancun, Mexico. Now a Category 4 hurricane — swirling some 545 miles southwest of Tampa — Milton is expected to barrel into the Sunshine State Wednesday night, likely as a large Category 3 storm with windspeeds between 111 and 129 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center.\\nThat means residents across the region have just over 24 hours to prepare before the monster storm's impending arrival. For some, that means battening down; for thousands more, it means evacuating their homes and fleeing.\\nKevin Guthrie, Florida's emergency management director, has been urging those in in more vulnerable areas to leave since the start of the week.\\n'If your plan calls for you to evacuate, you should do so today,' he said.\\nTampa Mayor Jane Castor echoed the sentiment, issuing a grim warning to residents who choose to stay behind.\\n'I can say without any dramatization whatsoever,' she told CNN, 'if you choose to stay in one of those evacuation areas, you're gonna die.'\\nRainfall amounts of 5 to 12 inches, with localized totals up to 18 inches, are expected across central to northern portions of the Florida Peninsula through Thursday, the NHC said Tuesday morning. Milton is additionally expected to dump 2 to 4 inches of rain across the Florida Keys through Thursday. The agency has also increased the peak storm surge forecast from 8-12 feet to 10-15 feet of inundation for the area from Anclote River to Tampa Bay\\nThe heavy rainfall, combined with high storm surge, could create an especially dangerous situation, meteorologists warn. As a result, nearly 20 million people across Florida and more than 5 million others are under storm surge alerts.\\nThe race to escape the super storm has sparked a mass exodus across Florida's Gulf Coast, snarling traffic across parts of the Panhandle. The state's Department of Transportation has since opened up the emergency shoulders on key interstates to better facilitate the amount of vehicles heading for safety. It has also come to coincide with crews' mad dash to clear debris left by Hurricane Helene.\\nThe storm walloped Florida just 12 days ago, ravaging parts of the same coastline currently in Milton's crosshairs. More than 230 deaths so far have been linked to the storm, making it the deadliest to strike the United States since Hurricane Katrina.\\nHelene also knocked out power for millions across the South and flooded entire neighborhoods, leavings buildings and vehicles entirely submerged in water.\\nIn the days since, Florida has deployed over 300 dump trucks that are working around the clock and have removed of 1,200 loads of debris.\\nA hurricane warning is in effect along much of the western Gulf Coast of Florida from Bonita Beach northward to the mouth of the Suwannee River, including Tampa Bay. These warnings also extend inland through central Florida, including Orlando.\",\n",

The remaining five were criminally charged with resisting arrest, misdemeanor assault, and obstructing government administration for clashing with police, an NYPD spokesman said. One demonstrator was additionally charged with making graffiti.\\nOfficials said the pro-Palestinian protesters could not stay in front of the stock exchange because demonstrators had spray painted there in the past.\\n'We're seeing an abridgement of our freedom of speech rights, our right to assembly,' Nerdeen Kiswani, 30, chair of Within our Lifetime, which organized the protest, said Monday as the clash unfolded. 'We were standing in front of the New York Stock Exchange because this is where major manufacturing, weapons manufacturers are traded, where Wall Street pockets blood money using our tax dollars to fund thousands of tons of bombs on the people of Gaza.'\\nPro-Palestinian New York City demonstrators marked the Oct. 7 anniversary with massive protests at Washington Square Park and Morningside Heights, matching wits with cops and college officials who were trying to stay ahead of the crowds.\\nStudents from more than a dozen local college campuses walked out of class and headed to Washington Square Park, before joining a larger citywide protest organized by the pro-Palestinian group Within Our Lifetime. The organization was originally formed by local students at the City University of New York.\\nBloodshed marred the mostly peaceful demonstrations when Todd Richman, a New Yorker holding an Israeli flag was ambushed by pro-Palestinian demonstrators marching past Union Square.\\nNo arrests have been made in that attack.\\nOn Oct. 7, 2023, the terrorist group Hamas launched a surprise attack on Israel that killed more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli official figures. Hamas took 251 hostages back to Gaza and a year later some 64 are still detained while 117 have been freed and 70 confirmed dead.\\nIsrael, in turn, launched an invasion that has since resulted in the deaths of more than 40,000 Palestinians in Gaza, more than half of whom were women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Editor's note: This story includes graphic language and mentions rape.\\nWhile Carlos Rodón found himself struggling in the fourth inning of Game 2 of the ALDS on Monday, the Yankees starter's wife, Ashley, received multiple frightening direct messages from anonymous users on Instagram.\\nOne user threatened that the couple's children would be raped and used a gay slur to describe Carlos. Another wrote 'someone will find your wife and kids.' That message included two knife emojis.\\n'I love interacting with everyone, but there's no place for this shit,' Ashley wrote in a post that shared the messages on X, formerly known as Twitter.\\nLater, after Carlos allowed four earned runs over 3.2 innings in the Yankees' 4-2 loss to the Royals, Ashley told the Daily News that the Rodóns have received mean, racist and threatening messages throughout Carlos' career.\\n'The messages never bother me until someone starts to bring my kids into it,' she said.\\nCarlos, meanwhile, wasn't aware of the threats until reporters told him about them after the game.\\n'That's wonderful,' he said sarcastically. 'People are pretty disgusting at times. But I feel like that doesn't explain Yankees fans. I don't think that's who they are. I understand that people get frustrated with the game. I guess my message to fans all around is that we are human as well. We do make mistakes. We're not always perfect. I'm, by far, not always perfect, and I understand frustration and I understand people get frustrated with performance.\\n'But let's not forget that this is ultimately just a game of baseball, and it doesn't come down to hurting and sending out negative messages and threatening people's families. Honestly, I feel for my wife, because our kids mean the world to us, and our family is really important to us.'\\nThe messages Ashley received mentioning rape were in response to a post she had shared about the family's foundation, which included information on miscarriages. Ashley suffered two miscarriages shortly after she married Carlos in 2018, and The Carlos Rodón Foundation seeks to make fertility treatments more accessible.\\nAshley said that she did not respond to any of the messages, nor did she report them to Instagram or the Yankees. She didn't see a point, as the users – void of real names and photos – could just make new accounts.\\n'This is such a common thing across sports for these guys,' Ashley said. 'I really would love to see social media make these burner accounts unavailable. Say it with your chest, aka your real name. Having to take accountability for your actions in the real world is the first step towards stopping this type of thing from happening.'\\nCarlos offered a similar reaction.\\n'When someone does that, we do take it personal, but obviously they're not man enough to actually put their name behind it and be real about it,' he said. 'They never will because they'll have to suffer the consequences of that, and that's okay. We'll move on. Doesn't mean nothing to us. We have a Game 3 to play in Kansas City, which is more important than what anyone else is saying anyways.'\\nCarlos went on to say that he understands criticism is 'part of doing business,' especially when players like himself are making millions of dollars.\\nHowever, the messages Ashley received crossed a line.\\n'There's definitely no room for people threatening harmless little kids that have nothing to do with what we do on the field,' Carlos said.\\nHe added that he certainly wanted to perform better on Monday night.\\n'They don't just go find anyone to come pitch here in Yankee Stadium,' he said. 'So [criticism] comes with the territory, and I'm all for it. I wish I would have been better today. Clearly, I expect more for myself. But I just know next time I go out there, I'm gonna compete my butt off.'\\nMeanwhile, Ashley said that she won't change her social media habits. She posts a lot, especially when Carlos pitches. She enjoys hearing from fans, at least the ones who remain respectful.\\n'I am highly self-aware that engaging with good fans is also going to mean I get engagement from the not-so-kind fans,' Ashley said. 'I love interacting and talking with true fans because I see myself in a very similar light. We all love the game. I just so happen to be married to one of the guys on the field.'\",\n",

       "   'excerpt': 'Social worker Justyna Rzewinski appeared before the Board of Correction Tuesday after she detailed exclusively to the Daily News how men were locked in their cells in mental health units at Rikers …',\n",
       "   'summary': \"The testimony of social worker Justyna Rzewinski about the extended lock-ins – or 'deadlocking' – of severely mentally ill people in a Rikers Island jail Tuesday drew the full attention of a city jail oversight board and pledges from a top Correction Department official to investigate.\\nRzewinski appeared before the Board of Correction after she detailed exclusively to the Daily News how men were locked in their cells in mental health units for weeks and even months at the George R. Vierno Center, causing extreme behavior like relentless screaming, banging on their doors day and night and smearing their own feces.\\n'This practice is widely known and widely practiced,' Rzewinski told the board. 'It was well established and throughout my time, I saw more and more individuals subjected to it.'\\nThe members of the board, who have often been at odds on other matters, seemed to agree her account called for further examination.\\n'These allegations are damning, especially to hear they are being used punitively. I propose we really dig further into this,' said Vice Chair Helen Skipper, a City Council appointee.\\nBoard Chair Dwayne Sampson, an Adams administration appointee, said, 'This concern of deadlocking has been a concern of mine since I've been on this board. The constant excuses of staffing and no medical staff, it's endless.'\\nDOC Commissioner Lynelle Maginley-Liddie did not attend the hearing; a DOC spokeswoman declining to say why she did not appear.\\nDOC's general counsel James Conway disputed the practice was occurring at the 'breadth and scope' characterized by Rzewinski.\\n'We are looking into the allegation wholesale so I don't have a lot of specifics. Until we further the investigation, we can't comment further,' Conway said.\\nLater, pressed by board member Robert Cohen, Conway said, 'There are procedures. It should not be categorized as just kind of a willy-nilly we're doing it. Anything beyond that is not something this commissioner will tolerate.'\\nBut Dr. Bupin Subedi, the chief medical officer with Correctional Health Services, the city agency that oversees medical care in the jail, told the board he did not dispute any part of Rzewinski's account.\\nJoseph Otonichar, the CHS chief of mental health, also seemed to contradict Conway on the extent of the practice.\\n'I've heard this term since I've started,' Otonichar said. 'We have really tried to work with our DOC colleagues in ensuring patients are escalated (brought to a hospital) when this does come up.'\\nCohen noted during the hearing that for three years, Mayor Adams and Mayor de Blasio before him suspended city rules that limit the duration of lock-ins to two hours via executive orders.\\n'I don't see any basis for it and people have been driven crazy by being locked in for long periods of time and hurt themselves,' Cohen said.\\nNatalie Fiorenzo, a senior corrections specialist with New York County Defender Services, described her shock after talking at length with Rzewinski. 'This was where we thought, where I thought, our clients would remain relatively stable and cared for … How wrong we were,' she said.\\nMayor Adams, who in July refused to implement parts of Local Law 42 which bans solitary confinement, told reporters at City Hall Tuesday he fully supports Maginley-Liddie. 'She's not going to tolerate the mistreatment of those … with severe mental health issues,' he said.\\nMore broadly, the mayor said he was concerned the plan to close Rikers might be merely displacing a problem without fixing it.\\n'You can't have 51% of the inmates at Rikers Island having mental health issues. That's just wrong,' he said. 'That is a failure of our city to place people with mental health issues in jail.'\\nPublic Advocate Jumaane Williams, a sponsored of Local Law 42, called the report in The News outlining the practice 'disturbing and alarming.'\\n'Not only is the city failing to provide mental health support on Rikers, these and other alleged DOC practices are actively harming the mental health of vulnerable incarcerated New Yorkers,' he said in a statement. 'This violates not only the Board of Correction minimum standards, but the minimum morals to which we should hold our city.'\\nAntoinette Anderson, a vice president with the Correction Officers Benevolent Association, insisted that officers don't have the authority to lock in detainees without approval of CHS.\\nAt the same time she expressed frustrations that seem to be held by a lot of officers. 'When we have an inmate who is assaulting staff what should we do with extreme situations,' she said.\\n'Why can't we get the hospitals for the mentally ill to properly help them because Rikers is not equipped for them.'\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Georgia congresswoman and conspiracy theorist Marjorie Taylor Greene took a break from indicating 'they' are weaponizing weather against Republicans to urge her supporters to drink raw milk.\\n'Raw Milk does a body good,' she posted Sunday on X. ' Make America Healthy Again!'\\nHer message included a photo of a mason jar filled with a thick white liquid. Medical experts largely agree drinking raw milk is a bad idea.\\n'Symptoms of foodborne illness from raw milk can include diarrhea, stomach cramping, and vomiting,' according to the Centers for Disease Control. 'In some cases, more severe outcomes like Guillain-Barré syndrome or hemolytic uremic syndrome can occur, potentially leading to paralysis, kidney failure, stroke, or even death.'\\nThe FDA warns that raw milk could expose consumers to E. coli, Listeria and Salmonella.\\nHer 'Make America Healthy Again' is a nod to fellow conspiracy buff Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who recently catapulted himself into the MAGA movement with hopes of pushing his fringe views on medical science into the mainstream. There's been heavy speculation among Donald Trump supporters that Kennedy could become the nation's secretary of Health and Human Services if the 78-year-old Republican nominee wins next month's presidential election.\\nGreene spent the past several days suggesting hurricane damage ravaging Republican districts are being directed by a vague 'they' to influence next month's presidential election.\\n'Yes they can control the weather,' she doubled-down Saturday after being mocked online for a similar comment she posted Thursday. 'By the way, the people know it and hate all of you who try to cover it up.'\\nGreene also suggested lasers can be used to impact weather patterns Saturday. Before taking office in 2021, the 50-year-old lawmaker claimed space lasers operated by a prominent Jewish banking family may have been responsible for causing wildfires in California. She later hedged the latter comment.\\nConspiracy Theory Alex Jones has urged Greene to run for president on his embattled 'InfoWars' program.\\n'It's not something I don't consider,' she confessed in a 2022 interview.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"The Yankees are waving the white flag on one aspect of Giancarlo Stanton 's game.\\nThe designated hitter has limited how fast he runs to try and prevent injury in the regular season and now it's already cost the Yankees in the postseason. In their Game 1 win over the Kansas City Royals on Saturday, Stanton was unable to score on an Oswaldo Cabrera double or plate a run on a potential infield single.\\nDespite the high stakes in the postseason, Stanton is still holding back with his legs and the Yankees approve.\\n'It is something we've kind of got to live with,'' Aaron Boone said Sunday on a Zoom call with reporters. 'Whether you've seen it over the years with a particular player that is incredibly slow that's an impactful player, it's something we've got to live with.\\n'He's got to do what he's got to do. He's trying to get to what is his top speed in a fluid way, as best he can.'\\nThe 34-year-old ranked in the third percentile in baseball in sprint speed as the 19th slowest player in baseball in 2024 — just behind the Royals' Salvador Perez, who was thrown out fairly easily by Juan Soto at home plate in Game 1 on a play that seemed to be an easy run-scoring opportunity off the bat.\\n'It's a controlled gait he knows he's got to get into,'' said Boone of Stanton's sprinting. 'He's burned himself when he's tried to throttle back up or down. That's when he knows he's been caught.'\\nThe veteran went 0-for-4 with two strikeouts on Saturday. However, the Yankees believe his bat is too important to take out of the lineup, so they will live with his shortcomings elsewhere. Stanton slashed .233/.298/.475 with 27 homers and 72 RBI.\\nNESTOR THROWS\\nThe Yankees got some good news from one of their injured starters. Nestor Cortes played catch on Sunday as he recovered from a flexor strain in his left elbow and all went well, pitching coach Matt Blake told the Daily News.\\nBoone told reporters on Sunday that Cortes is working towards a return at some point during the postseason. However, it remains up in the air if the 29-year-old will be able to contribute this October.\\nCortes made 30 starts this season pitching to a 3.77 ERA.\\nVERDUGO BACK IN LINEUP\\nAfter being the hero in Game 1, Alex Verdugo will be back in the lineup on Monday against Royals ace Cole Ragans, Boone said on Sunday.\\nDespite Ragans being a lefty, the manager is opting to sit switch-hitting Jasson Dominguez in favor of the hot hand.\\nVerdugo made a run-saving catch and added the game-winning hit on Saturday.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"What's the best jewelry-making kit?\\nIf you're looking for an outlet to flex that creative muscle, have you considered jewelry making? It's easy and fun to amp up your collection or make some stellar gifts by creating one-of-a-kind pieces. A jewelry kit is a great way to get started with jewelry projects, as it includes everything you need to get to work right away.\\nIn this review, we'll cover what you should know before making a jewelry kit purchase, what to seek in a quality kit and how much you can expect to spend. We'll also provide some solid product recommendations, including our best of the best pick for its versatility and high-quality beads, the Modda DIY jewelry-making Kit.\\nWhat to know before you buy a jewelry-making kit\\nType of kit\\nWith so many jewelry kits on the market, you need to narrow down your search to the type that suits you best. If you're a beginner crafter, a 'starter kit' will help you learn the basics and hit the ground running. Typically, these kits come with simple tools, findings, a small selection of beads, and some string, wire or chain.\\nOn the other hand, if you've tried your hand at jewelry-making before, a 'deluxe kit' might be more your speed. In these, you'll find the same types of items that come in starter kits, plus extra tools and supplies to make more pieces.\\nIf you have more advanced skills and experience in jewelry-making or already have a stash of jewelry supplies ready to go, a 'tools kit' could be your best bet. You'll only get the high-quality tools you need without any extra materials and instructions you don't.\\nKit components\\nJewelry kits typically come with the following components:\\nInstructions: You'll get step-by-step instructions with most starter and deluxe kits. You might find that online videos make an excellent supplement to them with clearer points and more examples.\\nFindings: These small bits join sections of your jewelry together and include items like jump rings, closures, clasps and hooks. You'll most often see silver- and gold-colored findings, but other finishes like black, rose gold or brushed metal are available, too.\\nTools: Most kits include one or more sets of pliers and possibly tweezers, wire cutters, snippers, crimping tools, scissors and hole punches. Some higher-quality kits even include ergonomically designed tools for a more secure grip and better long-term comfort.\\nBeads, charms and embellishments: The jewelry pieces that go into your creation will vary depending on the kit you choose. Typically, you'll get more selection with a higher-quality and pricier kit, with materials ranging from shell and wood to ceramic and resin.\\nStringing material: Wire, string, chain or cord are in most jewelry kits. You'll choose one of these on which to construct your project. The more advanced your kit, the better your chances of getting more than one of these stringing options with it.\\nDesign ideas\\nIt's good to know what type of jewelry design you'd like to learn and create before looking for the best jewelry-making kit. The sky is the limit, so without narrowing things down first, you could spend a lot of time shopping. To kickstart your inspiration, do some online research. You can find everything from drop earrings, layered necklaces, toe rings, resin pendants and macrame stacked bracelets to non-standard pieces like backpack or purse charms, hairpins, key chains and even beaded chandeliers.\\nWhat to look for in a quality jewelry-making kit\\nThere are different considerations to make when looking for the best jewelry-making kit. Here, we'll go over finding high-quality components and tools, making the proper selection of beads, charms and other embellishments for your projects, and choosing designs and patterns that work for you.\\nSolid components and tools\\nIf you expect to make jewelry for the long haul or simply make creations as gifts, you'll want durable, high-quality tools, findings and jewelry components that will last.\\nSimple, cheaper kits tend to come with cheaply made beads, sometimes with uneven holes that can make them tricky to string. Also, cheaper metals like nickel and copper, acrylic, silicone and plastic can cause sensitivity or allergic reactions, such as skin discoloration or swollen earlobes. It's best to use stainless steel, silver, gold or platinum for earrings. Higher-quality metals reduce the chance of adverse reactions and make the earrings more comfortable.\\nNo matter what you're making, you'll find that higher-quality kits offer better-designed products that are arranged and strung easily. Plus, lower-quality or cheaper tools can easily rust, wear and break, and the last thing you want to do is run out to the craft store mid-project because your pliers gave way. Failing to consider these things can potentially mean frustration and eventually losing interest in your hobby altogether. What's the fun in that?\\nRight designs and tools\\nOnce you've thought about the type of jewelry you'd like to make, which could be anything from a woven bracelet to chandelier earrings, you should consider its pattern or design. Many kits, especially starters, will come with some form of pattern laid out in step-by-step instructions.\\nAlong with the right design, your kit should include everything you need to create your piece from start to finish. Of course, the array of materials will depend on the type of kit you purchase. You can always pick up supplemental supplies later.\\nYou'll find clasps, hooks, thread and chains in most kits. Materials often include beads, but beaded items aren't the only type of jewelry you can make. Things like clay or stone pendants, leather cuffs and necklace chains for a mask or glasses are lovely options, too.\\nYou will be bending wires, closing clasps and snipping ends, so you'll need wire cutters, crimping tools and various pliers (usually flat, chain and round nose). Depending on your creations, tweezers, scissors and measuring tape could come in handy as well.\\nIdeal beads, charms and other embellishments\\nSomewhat related to finding the right pattern, the beads, charms and other embellishments you choose will make all the difference in how your project looks.\\nAs you've probably seen in farmers' markets, stores, online marketplaces and other places, there are seemingly limitless styles and aesthetics in jewelry. There are thousands upon thousands of different materials, colors, textures, sizes and compositions. The possibilities are truly endless.\\nThis is precisely why you'll want to shop around to find the jewelry kit containing the beads, charms and other embellishments that speak powerfully to you and your creativity.\\nHow much you can expect to spend on a jewelry-making kit\\njewelry-making kits range in price from about $15 to $25 for a starter, $30-$60 for a mid-range, and $60-$100. Prices are higher for a professional, top-grade kit. What you pay will depend on the number of pieces, quality of components, and extra accessories, like a case.\\nJewelry-making kit FAQ\\nCan I get a kit without beads and findings so I can choose exactly what I want?\\nA. Yes. Some manufacturers make jewelry kits with just the tools you need. Sometimes, though, it's more cost-effective just to get a complete set as it comes, with beads and findings. You can always give them away or use them for practicing a new technique before working on the real deal.\\nDo jewelry kits only come with beaded designs?\\nA. Absolutely not!

Ever, ever, ever,' she told Vogue in its November cover story, published Tuesday. 'I'm never talking about my sexuality ever again.

'I think it's such a frowned-upon thing to talk about, and I think that should change.'\\nEilish also opened up about embracing her attraction to women.\\nWriting 'Lunch,' one of the raunchy tracks off her new album, 'was actually part of what helped me become who I am,' she said. 'I wrote some of it before even doing anything with a girl, and then wrote the rest after.'\\n'I've been in love with girls for my whole life, but I just didn't understand,' she revealed, 'until, last year, I realized I wanted my face in a vagina.\",\n",

Speculation has run rampant ever since on who the founder might really be.\\nA frontrunner has long been pioneering cryptographer Len Sassaman, who died by suicide in 2011. Further adding to the mystery, and perhaps the difficulty of solving it, is a crypto wallet holding a million Bitcoin belonging to Nakamoto that has reportedly been inactive for over a decade.\\nBut HBO's documentary and filmmaker Cullen Hoback claim to have uncovered the truth, though there's skepticism on whether definitive proof will be delivered when the film debuts on Tuesday at 9 p.m.\\n'The documentary film offers a thrilling, globe-spanning investigation, with Hoback immersing himself with key players, uncovering never-before-seen clues, and humorously unraveling Bitcoin's meteoric rise,' HBO says in a promo for its latest offering.\\nShould Hoback — who's credited with shedding light on the QAnon conspiracy theory movement in 2021's ' Q: Into the Storm ' — be successful in his latest doc, such a revelation could impact Bitcoin's value, according to The Street.\\nHBO sleuths have previously been credited with cracking a big case in the 2015 docuseries ' The Jinx, ' in which real estate heir Robert Durst confessed to murder in a now-famous hot mic moment.

       "   'summary': \"Lisa Marie Presley's posthumous memoir is chock full of revelations, ranging from heartbreaking to salacious, regarding her own life as well as the private lives of fellow famous faces, including her ex-husband Michael Jackson and late father Elvis.\\n'From Here to the Great Unknown' hit shelves Tuesday and was co-written by Presley's eldest child, actress Riley Keough.\\nOf agreeing to help pen the book, Keough — who became the sole trustee of her mother's estate, as well as the owner of Graceland, following Presley's sudden death in January 2023 — says her mom believed she could have a 'more holistic view of her life than she could.'\\n'The last 10 years of her life had been so brutally hard that she was only able to look back on everything through that lens,' Keough writes in the introduction, according to an excerpt published by People. 'I agreed to help her with it, not thinking much of the commitment, assuming we would write it together over time. A month later, she died.'\\nHere are some of the biggest revelations and bombshells revealed in 'From Here to the Great Unknown.'\\nMichael Jackson was a virgin at 35 when he and Lisa Marie started dating\\nAt the time they got together in 1994, when Presley was 26 and Jackson was 35, the late King of Pop revealed to her that 'he was still a virgin.'\\n'I think he had kissed Tatum O'Neal, and he'd had a thing with Brooke Shields, which hadn't been physical apart from a kiss,' Presley wrote in an excerpt obtained by People. 'He said Madonna had tried to hook up with him once, too, but nothing happened.'\\nShe and Jackson wed soon after, in May 1994, just weeks after Presley divorced Danny Keough, with whom she shared Riley and son Benjamin.\\nThe memoir also details how Presley and Jackson got together, with the 'Thriller' singer confessing his love for her during a trip to Las Vegas while she was still married to Keough.\\nPresley and Jackson were married for just over two years before finalizing their divorce in August 1996.\\nLisa Marie kept son Benjamin's body on ice for two months after his suicide\\nFollowing the suicide death of 27-year-old Benjamin in July 2020, Presley arranged to have a funeral home bring her son's body to her house in Calabasas, Calif., where she preserved him at 55 degrees until October of that year. It was then that Benjamin was laid to rest at Graceland, where Elvis and now Lisa Marie are also buried.\\n'I think it would scare the living f–king piss out of anybody else to have their son there like that,' she wrote. 'But not me.'\\nThe dysfunctional, yet traditional role Elvis played in her life\\nPresley recalls how the 'Suspicious Minds' crooner would attend her parent-teacher conferences, during which Elvis would don a simultaneously ostentatious yet 'respectable outfit,' remembered as 'black pants and some kind of blouse — but he was also wearing a big, majestic belt with buckles and jewels and chains, as well as sunglasses,' per People.\\nThough Presley made clear her adoration for her father, who died in 1977 of complications from drug use, the domesticity didn't override the dysfunction to which she was privy.\\nView this post on Instagram\\nA post shared by Lisa Marie Presley (@lisampresley)\\n'I was always worried about my dad dying,' Lisa Marie recalled in the memoir, according to another excerpt published by People. 'Sometimes I'd see him and he was out of it. Sometimes I would find him passed out. I wrote a poem with the line, 'I hope my daddy doesn't die.''\\nLisa Marie's own struggles with substance abuse\\nAfter welcoming twin daughters Finley and Harper Vivienne, now 16, Presley said she was given 'short-term prescription of opioids' and felt 'the need to keep taking them' after.\\n'For a couple of years, it was recreational, and then it wasn't,' admitted Presley, who shared the girls with Michael Lockwood, whom she divorced in 2016. 'It was an absolute matter of addiction, withdrawal in the big leagues.'\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"The woman convicted for an on-set death on the Western film 'Rust' pleaded guilty Monday to a separate gun crime.\\nHannah Gutierrez-Reed, 27, was convicted earlier this year of involuntary manslaughter for the death of Halyna Hutchins in 2021.\\nAs part of that investigation, she turned over her cellphone to authorities. Cops found a video on her phone in which she bragged about brandishing a gun inside a New Mexico bar, even though bringing firearms into places with a liquor license is illegal in the state.\\nGutierrez-Reed pleaded guilty Monday to violating that law, and Judge T. Glenn Ellington sentenced her to 18 months of probation. That sentence will be served concurrently with her 18-month prison term for involuntary manslaughter, meaning she'll complete a significant portion while already behind bars.\\n'I'd just like to apologize to the court and thank you for your judgment today,' Gutierrez-Reed said at the hearing.\\nGutierrez-Reed was the only person convicted in connection with Hutchins' death. Though actor Alec Baldwin was holding the gun when it fired a bullet that killed Hutchins and wounded director Joel Souza, his case was tossed in July due to mishandled evidence.\\nHowever, a judge ruled the same procedural error would not save Gutierrez-Reed, who investigators said brought live ammunition onto the set and loaded it into the gun that Baldwin later held. She began serving her 18-month sentence in March, immediately after she was convicted, and her appeal was rejected in September.\\nIn addition to the 18 months of probation, Gutierrez-Reed's plea deal bans her from possessing firearms, taking drugs and consuming alcohol. She was also fined $180.\\n'She's not gotten a fair shake from the beginning,' her mother, Stacy Reed, told The Associated Press after the hearing.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Sum 41 frontman Deryck Whibley claims his he was 'groomed' and sexually abused by the band's former manager, who's 18 years his senior.\\nAccording to the Los Angeles Times, The 'Fatlip' singer made his allegation against Greig Nori in his memoir 'Walking Disaster: My Life Through Heaven and Hell' which went on sale Tuesday.\\nWhibley says he was 16 when he met Nori, who was 34 years old and playing in the band Canadian punk group Treble Charger. Whibley, also a Canadian musician, said he looked up to Nori, with whom he struck up a friendship after sneaking backstage at a Treble Charger show.\\nNori allegedly gave him alcohol for the first time — shots of Goldschläger. The two worked together as songwriters and exchanged ideas.\\nAccording to Whibley, his relationship with Nori turned physical after he turned 18 years old and his mentor 'passionately' kissed him at a party where there was booze and ecstasy. The Sum 41 star said he walked away shocked by what happened, but the sexual encounters continued. Whibley claims he never identified with homosexuality and was told by Nori he didn't either, but their connection was 'so special.'\\nEventually Nori came to manage Sum 41. He held that job from the around 1997 to 2005.\\nWhibley said it was pop punk artist Avril Lavigne, whom he started in dating in 2004, who spelled out for him that he'd been sexually abused. Lavigne and Whibley married in 2006 and split three years later.\\nAccording to Whibley, his former manager and tormenter also manipulated him professionally. That included receiving songwriting credits on their albums 'Does This Look Infected?' and 'Chuck,' which Noori produced. A lawsuit against Nori returned those rights to Whibley.\",\n",

On Tuesday, Bahi was hit with criminal charges alleging he destroyed evidence and tampered with witnesses in the federal corruption investigation that resulted in Adams' indictment last month on charges that he solicited bribes and illegal campaign contributions from Turkish government operatives and others in exchange for political favors.\\nIt's unclear if the Chughtai raid — first reported by the news outlet The City — was connected to the probe that resulted in charges against Bahi and Adams.\\nChughtai, whose Sept. 30 firing was first reported Monday by The News, didn't return a request for comment Tuesday, nor did Adams' office, which has declined to divulge a reason for Chughtai's termination. The Manhattan U.S. attorney's office, which is prosecuting Adams and Bahi, declined to comment, as did the FBI and the city's Department of Investigation.\\nThe charges against Bahi allege he directed Toleb Mansurov, a construction company owner and Uzbek community leader, to lie to federal authorities about funneling illegal straw donations to Adams' 2021 campaign via four employees.\\nAdams' indictment contains references to Mansurov, alleging the mayor knowingly 'solicited and received' illegal donations from him.\\nThe mayor's indictment also alleges two 'Adams employees' — one of whom has been identified as Bahi — helped Mansurov set up the illegal donations. The second employee who helped Mansurov hasn't been identified, but both that person and Bahi are referred to in Adams' indictment as 'liaisons' to Mansurov's community who worked as 'volunteers' for Adams' 2021 campaign before joining City Hall.\\nA source directly familiar with the matter told The News that Bahi and Chughtai served as Muslim community surrogates for Adams' 2021 campaign.\",\n",

       "   'summary': 'Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz cited a Bible verse at Tuesday\\'s CBS News Vice Presidential debate to emphasize why Congress should have passed the bipartisan sweeping border package that the Senate blocked in May.\\nWalz echoed Vice President Kamala Harris\\' sentiments at the last debate, arguing the immigration bill would address a host of issues at the southern border, a critical issue for voters. The failed bill aimed to shorten the timeframe for consideration of asylum claims, make it difficult for migrants to qualify and shut down processing of applications from people who crossed illegally.\\nThe Democratic vice presidential nominee said law enforcement not only supported but helped craft the bill, which he said would practically make a difference and \"adhere to what we know as American principles.\"\\n\"I don\\'t talk about my faith a lot, but Matthew 25:40 talks about, \\'To the least amongst us, you do unto me,\\'\" Walz said. \"Americans, they simply want order to it. This bill does it. It\\'s funded. It\\'s supported by the people who do it, and it lets us keep our dignity about how we treat other people.\"\\nDebate live updates:What time is vice presidential debate tonight? Channel, watch online\\nWalz made the comment after his debate opponent, U.S. Sen. JD Vance (R-OH) blamed Harris for a rise in illegal immigrants, which he linked to unaffordable housing and the fentanyl crisis. Vance emphasized that in order to address the crisis, law enforcement needs the president to empower agents to do their job.\\n\"You\\'ve got housing that is totally unaffordable because we have illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes,\" Vance said. \"It is a disgrace, Tim, and I actually think I agree with you. I think you want to solve this problem, but I don\\'t think that Kamala Harris does.\"\\nBible verse Matthew 25:40 cites that \"The King will reply, \\'Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.\\'\"\\nWalz is Lutheran along with more than 20% of Minnesota\\'s population, according to the Pew Research Center.\\nIf elected, Walz would become only the second Lutheran vice president if you don\\'t count Minnesotan Hubert Humphrey, who was raised Lutheran before joining a Methodist church when his family moved to a city where there wasn\\'t a Lutheran one available.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'It turns out Republican Senate candidate Eric Hovde was right.\\nA couple of months ago, Hovde said Thomas Leager, an independent candidate for the U.S. Senate, was \"a Democrat plant to try to siphon off votes from me.\"\\nLeager, a gun rights activist who was an unindicted co-conspirator in the failed plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer back in 2020, dismissed the notion.\\nBut new reporting by The Associated Press shows the group that encouraged Leager to run, Patriots Run Project, has pretended to be an advocate for former Republican President Donald Trump. Its real modus operandi has been to recruit about a half-dozen Trump allies to run as independents in key races where they could swipe votes from legitimate GOP candidates.\\nMany Patriot Run candidates are disabled, retired or both.\\nThis week, Leager said he was already planning to run for elective office when a guy named \"Johnny\" from Patriots Run contacted him earlier this year to encourage him to jump in the race for U.S. Senate. He said the group acted as if it were independent.\\n\"I thought they were pushing pro-Trump candidates,\" said Leager, who calls himself an \"America First\" candidate.\\nThe group helped raise some $20,000 to get Leager on the ballot in Wisconsin. Among the donors, the AP reported, are three well-known Democratic supporters. None of the contributors is from Wisconsin.\\nLeager, a former lobbyist for the \"no compromise\" Wisconsin Gun Owners Inc., said the fake Trump front group has not had any input on the content of his campaign. He said he doesn\\'t like it that he wasn\\'t aware of the scheme when he was recruited.\\nIn the end, he said he believes his far-right agenda will siphon off votes from both Hovde and his opponent, Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin. A Marquette Law School survey showed this week that he is polling at 1%.\\n\"Their plan was flawed, and they didn\\'t think it through,\" Leager said of Patriots Run. \"It might end up costing, you know, Baldwin just as much as they cost Hovde.\"\\nWisconsin Democrats scurried away from Patriots Run and the three Democratic donors who helped out Leager. Party officials said these individuals were acting on their own and not in concert with the party.\\nBaldwin campaign spokesman Andrew Mamo said Baldwin doesn\\'t know Leager and had no role in getting him to run against her: \"This is not a friend of Tammy\\'s.\"\\nBut Hovde and other Republicans blasted the scheme and suggested it was part of a larger Democratic operation.\\n\"Tammy Baldwin and her allies will tell any lie or engage in any act of deception to hold onto power,\" said Zach Bannon, a Hovde spokesman. \"While claiming to defend democracy, they are actively undermining our democracy with shameless schemes. It\\'s time for change.\"\\nSaid Mike Berg of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, \"Democrats love to talk about \\'threats to democracy,\\' unless it involves their own work to sabotage one of this year\\'s top battleground Senate races.\"\\nPatriots Run first gained attention last month after the AP reported that a felon running as an independent in a House race in Iowa suspected he\\'d been duped by the group. The candidate has since removed his name from the ballot.\\nThe group has recruited at least six House candidates in addition to Leager.\\nIn Leager\\'s case, five donors gave him $3,300, the maximum amount for a primary, and one $6,600, the max for a primary and general election. The money went to Urban Media, which Baldwin and other Democrats have used in the past for a variety of services, federal records show.\\nThe donors include David Steinglass, who along with his wife has donated $3.5 million to liberals and Democrats, including $100,000 to President Joe Biden in 2020; venture capitalist and Trump supporter Richard Thompson of Wyoming; and political consultant Joe Fox, a Democratic campaign consultant.\\nNone returned calls this week.\\nIn Leager, Patriot Run got a candidate unlike any other.\\nLeager was one of 16 unindicted co-conspirators in the failed plot to kidnap Whitmer with the hope of overthrowing the state government, according to a filing by the Michigan attorney general. The scheme received widespread attention as an example of domestic terrorism shortly before the last presidential contest.\\nLeager was subpoenaed to testify at a 2022 trial for four defendants but exercised his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself to avoid getting indicted.\\nIn the end, 14 men were charged criminally in state or federal court in the case. Nine were convicted, and five were cleared.\\nLeager said he knew many of the people involved in the case, including Barry Croft, the accused bomb-maker. Croft once called from jail to appear on Leager\\'s podcast, \"The Free Men Report,\" to profess his innocence shortly before a key court hearing to decide which evidence would be shown to jurors.\\nCroft was sentenced to 19 years and seven months in federal prison for his role in the kidnapping plot, conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction and possessing an unregistered destructive device\\n\\'I was the Wisconsin target for the FBI in the Whitmer case. We just happened to slip through their nets,\\' Leager said in March, according to the AP.\\nAlong with all that, Leager also helped lead rallies opposing the lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic and defended Kenosha shooter Kyle Rittenhouse\\'s right to defend himself.\\nAs a candidate, he\\'s pushing a platform far to the right of Hovde. He\\'s even set up a web page ripping the Republican candidate.\\nAmong other things, Leager is calling for abolishing the FBI, closing the borders, eliminating the federal income tax, halting all foreign aid until the U.S. debt is under $100 million, passing a constitutional amendment recognizing fetuses as legal persons, bringing troops home and protecting children from \"radical gender theory.\"\\nLeager said he had some suspicions about Patriots Run when it paid Urban Media to gather signatures. But Leager said he is tired of talking about all of that.\\nHe said he\\'d rather focus on his platform and how he\\'s trying to win this election as a third-party candidate.\\n\"My policies aren\\'t insane,\" Leager said. \"I think they\\'re pretty reasonable.\"',\n",

       "   'excerpt': \"Don't call it a recall, but Toyota will replace the eight-speed transmissions in certain Tacomas.\",\n",
       "   'summary': \"If you frequently visit Toyota forums, then you probably noticed that a not insignificant number of owners of the new 2024 Toyota Tacoma have been complaining about transmission gremlins. It seems like the problem has been specific to those who opted for the eight-speed automatic transmission. Having a bad gearbox in a brand-new truck is surely frustrating.\\nToyota is officially recognizing the issue and is doing something about it, sort of. According to a report from CarScoops, Toyota is offering to replace faulty eight-speed transmissions in 2024 model-year Toyota Tacoma trucks, though this isn't a safety 'recall,' but rather a technical service bulletin that's been issued to dealers. Toyota isn't considering this a safety issue and is not replacing transmissions on all Tacomas, only those that have already broken.\\nFurthermore, in order to qualify for the fix, your Tacoma must display one or more of six specific fault codes when its onboard diagnostic system is scanned at a dealership.\\nFor reference these are the fault codes in question:\\nJudging by the codes, which have surfaced on a forum, it would seem that the cause of the issue is a stuck pressure control solenoid actuator, or a torque converter clutch actuator being frozen in the off position. If your Tacoma displays one of the codes, Toyota will replace the entire transmission and torque converter assembly.\\nChevrolet trucks and SUVs:Want to use Google Maps? It'll cost you an extra $300 per year\\nTrucks with the manual transmission aren't affected by this problem, so if you have three pedals in your Tacoma you can rest easy. If you own one of the affected trucks, then at least you know a fix is coming. The question is how widespread the problem is, and how long will it take dealers to fix it. Replacing a transmission isn't a quick job, even with experienced techs that have all the proper tools. We recommend reaching out to your local dealer ASAP before a long queue develops.\\nPotential transmission problems aside, when we first drove the 2024 Toyota Tacoma, we were highly impressed. We found it to be a huge upgrade over the previous model, while keeping the character that Tacomas are known for. We would still recommend the truck, though it's worth maybe waiting until Toyota sorts out this transmission thing or better yet, opting for the truck's manual transmission, a fast-disappearing option on midsize trucks generally.\",\n",

       "   'summary': 'DELAFIELD - A 60-year-old man, who tenants had previously voiced concerns about for his odd behavior, faces 10 felony counts of recklessly endangering safety in connection with a Sept. 12 fire at an eight-unit apartment building.\\nStephen P. Anderson, whose current address was listed as Milwaukee but who lived at the Delafield apartment building at 4735 Vista Park Court at the time of the fire, made his first appearance in Waukesha County Circuit Court on Wednesday. He was ordered held on a $500,000 cash bond.\\nThe fire forced the evacuation of the apartment building as well as the rescue of an upper-unit tenant who was trapped by smoke. All of the tenants were initially displaced by the fire, and only some were able to return home. The remaining tenants were offered available units elsewhere.\\nBut it was Anderson\\'s alleged actions during the fire that prompted a criminal investigation.\\nIn the criminal complaint filed Wednesday, authorities said one tenant told them he saw Anderson twice outside after the fire had started: first, fully clothed and unusually calm while falsely claiming upper-unit residents had already evacuated, and again minutes later, naked and leaving the scene on foot.\\nAccording to the complaint:\\nTenants had previously had run-ins with Anderson, who had moved into his lower-level unit just five days prior to the fire. One tenant said Anderson had threatened to stab him. Demonic messages and a dead bird had also been found in the building in that five-day span, and police were called several times due to resident concerns.\\nOne tenant, who ran outside after smelling and seeing smoke, told investigators that Anderson was oddly calm outside, acting like he was \"on a Sunday stroll\" and didn\\'t have \"a care in the world.\" But it was Anderson\\'s alleged statement that the people upstairs had already evacuated during the late-night fire that raised safety concerns.\\nAfter the tenant went back inside the building to confirm the other tenants\\' status, he found most residents were still inside, presumably asleep and unaware of the fire. He roused them, called 911 and pulled the fire alarm. When the tenant, who is only identified as Victim B in the complaint, returned outside, he spotted Anderson again, this time completely naked, reaching into a dumpster to retrieve two cardboard pieces used to cover himself.\\nPolice located him after the fire a half-mile from the apartment building, still naked.\\nThe complaint does not allege that Anderson intentionally started the fire. Instead, the 10 endangerment counts, one for each resident who was inside the building at the time, focus on his actions during the fire, including showing \"utter disregard for human life.\"\\nEach first-degree felony count carries a maximum sentence of 12 years in prison and a $25,000 fine if he is convicted. Two of the counts carry a modifier because two of the tenants were considered elderly. That could increase the maximum penalty by six years in prison.\\nA public defender who was expected to be assigned to Anderson, Kyle Jesinski, was not immediately available late Wednesday afternoon to comment.\\nAnderson remains in custody in the Waukesha County Jail. His next court appearance, for a preliminary hearing, was set for Oct. 21.',\n",

Josh Kendall gives his early take on the Packers\\' draft class.\\n\"The most impactful newcomer from this class has been safety Javon Bullard, a second-round pick who is third on the team with 20 tackles. The two players the Packers took before Bullard — offensive lineman Jordan Morgan and linebacker Edgerrin Cooper — aren\\'t regulars in the lineup. The continued production from the 2023 draft class of pass catchers — Luke Musgrave, Tucker Kraft, Jayden Reed and Dontayvion Wicks — means the Packers may have been due a miss or two this year.\"\\nPete Prisco gives a matter-of-fact assessment after the Vikings loss knocked the Packers down two spots:\\n\"Jordan Love was back, but it was clear he was rusty early in the loss to the Vikings. The defense certainly wasn\\'t as good as it has been, which is a concern.\"\\nThe Packers stood pat in the rankings here. Rob Demovsky gets real about why all this extra heat the Packers are emphasizing on opposing quarterbacks has some cold facts:\\n\"While the Packers have pressured opposing quarterbacks 49 times (sixth most in the NFL through Week 4, according to ESPN Research), they\\'re not necessarily moving those signal-callers off the spot or speeding up their release. Passers have averaged 2.71 seconds inside the pocket, the most in the league, and they\\'re averaging 3.04 seconds before throwing, second most in the league. Green Bay\\'s pass rush win rate of 27.3% is the lowest in the league.\"\\nThe Packers dropped four spots. According to Mike Florio, \"Someone should have talked Jordan Love into waiting another week or two.\"\\nNate Davis is another national writer looking at the improvement at safety, despite a six-spot drop from a week ago:\\n\"How good a signing has SS Xavier McKinney been? He\\'s the first player this century to pick off a pass in his first four games with a team.\"\\nIt wasn\\'t a smooth September for the Packers, who dropped one spot, but Frank Schwab believes they\\'ll recover:',\n",

The Miyazaki airport was constructed by the Imperial Japanese Navy in 1943 as a training base for aviation cadets, as well as an airfield from which kamikaze pilots took off on suicide attack missions. Japan's Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported that unexploded ordnance has been found near the airport in the past.\\nIt remains unknown what caused the bomb to explode after lying inert for more than seven decades.\\nThe airport is expected to resume operations on Thursday.\\nContributing: Reuters\",\n",

However, the number of people who could have a partial sight-line on the eclipse is much larger — about 245 million people.\\nSouthern parts of Argentina and Chile will see the annular eclipse in its full glory. In the U.S., Hawaii is the only state expected to have a partial view of the Oct. 2 eclipse.\\nAccording to NASA, other territories and countries that could see at least a partial eclipse include:\\nWisconsin hasn\\'t been on an eclipse\\'s path of totality since 1954 ... and it won\\'t be again until the end of the 21st century. So, if you long to experience totality\\'s stunning effects, your best bet may be to travel to another state to see it, as many Wisconsinites did for the 2024 and 2017 eclipses.\\nThe next total solar eclipse visible from the continental United States will not occur for another 20 years. More specifically, it will be here on Aug. 23, 2044. However, only three states ― Montana, North Dakota and South Dakota ― will be on its path of totality.',\n",

She can look at scary and difficult situations without flinching.\\n\"But I was always afraid of cancer,\" she said. In nursing school she only did the minimum necessary with cancer to pass her boards.\\nFete\\'s general health was good this past May when she went for her annual mammogram. But the mammogram showed something that led to an ultrasound, followed by a biopsy. The tissue was malignant. She had breast cancer.\\n\"It was really freaky for me to get this diagnosis … I was just frightened, and ignorant,\" she said, even though she knows a lot about how medicine works, and her best friend had breast cancer five years ago.\\nBut she quickly learned that treatment was \"vastly different\" than what she saw in nursing school in the \\'80s. She was also told early on by her medical team that her prognosis was \"very, very good.\"\\nSo Fete has turned from someone who avoided the C-word to a person who talks openly about her cancer experience. If anyone reading this article is afraid like she was, Fete would \"love to be able to say to them, it\\'s OK, it\\'s not so scary.\"\\nWhile receiving treatment, Fete is also directing Renaissance\\'s season-opening production of Jen Silverman\\'s \"The Moors,\" which will be performed Oct. 18-Nov. 10. A close-knit company founded and led by women, Renaissance has worked out a plan to support Fete personally and artistically while also ensuring backup for contingencies.\\n\"This story of this company run by women, that\\'s what we do,\" said Marketing Director Sarah Kriger Hwang. \"We solve problems like nobody else.\"\\nBefore it began, Fete said she was \"so afraid of chemo(therapy).\" She has since completed her first 12-week course of medication, and is in the middle of a concluding nine-week course. \"It\\'s not how I\\'d like to spend the day,\" she said. But the steroids and anti-nausea medication she is given right before infusion help her tolerate the chemo. She considers herself lucky: She\\'s had no nausea and no peripheral neuropathy (numbness and tingling) due to the chemo agents.\\nFete also is doing \"cold cap\" therapy, wearing a scalp-cooling cap that vasoconstricts blood vessels in her head, making it harder for chemo agents to get to her scalp and cause hair loss.\\nReferring back to her nursing experience, Fete said she probably had worked in 30 different hospitals but never experienced the kind of care she is receiving at UW Health Cancer Center at ProHealth Care in Waukesha. \"I suggest that I might be more comfortable if I had a different ointment for my rash, and it appears,\" she said. \"They\\'re always trying to make things go smoother, you know.\"\\nAn ultrasound prior to beginning her second round of chemotherapy showed her tumor had been reduced by 85%, according to Fete. \"I feel so blessed,\" she said.\\nOnce she got over her initial reserve and began talking about her cancer, Fete received support from many directions, including from donors and board members. Some of them shared their own breast cancer stories. Even the woman who conducted Fete\\'s recent echocardiogram is a breast cancer survivor who shared her story.\\nShe also has strong support at home from her husband, Jeff, a recently retired radiologist.\\nAfter receiving her diagnosis, Fete thought Renaissance should find another director for \"The Moors.\" That would have made her sad — she\\'s emotionally invested in this production, and she helped recruit \"Homeland\" actor Sarah Sokolovic back to Milwaukee to perform in it.\\nShe brought the question up to her medical team, explaining how directing and the rehearsal process works. To her surprise, they told her she should be able to do it, but to get a buddy to work with her.\\nShe called her friend, theater director Mallory Metoxen, a former Renaissance staff member and ally of the company. Fete remembered raising the question: \"How can we blanket this problem with as many safeguards and backup plans\" as needed?\\n\"We\\'re women, we plan,\" Kriger Hwang interjected. \"We don\\'t come to the table without alternative plans.\"\\nAt Fete\\'s request, Metoxen is now the production\\'s \"swing director,\" ready to step in if and when the production needs her.\\nFete prepared as fully as possible, planning a rehearsal schedule that includes an extra day off each week for herself. During the rehearsal period, Fete is working five days a week, rather than the typical six-day week a director works. This play has music in it, so on a day Fete is not there, music director Jill Anna Ponasik can work with the cast, she said. Metoxen is prepared to handle some rehearsals to reinforce the show and, if Fete goes through a rough patch with her health, \"(Metoxen) can come in and take over,\" Fete said. To date, Metoxen has not had to direct any rehearsals, but attends them and speaks regularly with Fete to keep the artistic vision consistent. Fete explained the plan in detail to the actors months ago, giving them an opportunity to leave the production if they wanted (none did).\\n\"It\\'s really never going to be a change of director. It might be a change of executor,\" said Kriger Hwang. If Metoxen steps in as director, \"she will be moving forward Susan\\'s vision and Susan\\'s direction of the play,\" Kriger Hwang said.\\nIn a follow-up email, Fete admitted she is very tired. \"The fatigue gets a little worse with each subsequent treatment, but so far so good,\" she wrote.\\n\"Rehearsal is fantastic and exciting. It\\'s also a wonderful diversion. I find myself forgetting I have cancer for several hours and that\\'s wonderful!\"\\nShe also noted that rehearsal is the only thing she is doing. \"The rest of the RTW team has absorbed all my other duties. They are rockstars and I could not do this without them,\" she wrote.\\n\"I get up and go to rehearsal, I come home and my husband feeds me, then I go to bed.\"\\nFete is 66. Her age, combined with her health situation, make it reasonable to ask if she and Renaissance have done any succession planning around her role as artistic director. She is the lone company founder still on the leadership team.\\n\"I love Renaissance. I want it to continue well past all of us,\" she said. \"I would love if my grandchildren did go someday when, you know, I\\'m a memory.\"\\nShe does not intend to retire because of her cancer. At the same time, she said, \"I think theater is a young person\\'s game, in a lot of ways.\" She\\'d like to have some fun and go on vacations with her husband.\\n\"I will leave Renaissance in great hands when I go, and that\\'s going to be a process,\" she said.\\nFete\\'s breast cancer was discovered through her routine annual mammogram. When she hears about people who don\\'t want to get a mammogram because they\\'re afraid of what it will show, or afraid of possible treatment, she wants to speak to them.\\n\"You don\\'t have to be afraid,\" she said.\\nPeople will get sick because it\\'s a human thing to get sick, she said. \"It\\'s OK because there are wonderful places that will treat you and be there for you.\"\\nGetting a mammogram is \"how you avoid the scary,\" Kriger Hwang said. \"When you catch these things early, your prognosis is like what Suzan\\'s is. When you don\\'t take care of it and you let it go too long, is when you end up in a more difficult situation.\"\\nThe current US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation is that women who are 40 to 74 years old and are at average risk for breast cancer get a mammogram every 2 years. Note the nuance in that recommendation of \"average risk.\" The Yale Cancer Center has a detailed discussion of the new mammogram guidelines. Women in higher-risk categories, including ones who carry genetic mutations that increase cancer risk, \"should continue to follow their doctor\\'s advice on screening age and frequency.\"\\nIn conjunction with this production and with October being Breast Cancer Awareness Month, Fete and Renaissance will be collaborating with ABCD: After Breast Cancer Diagnosis, a nonprofit that provides emotional support to anyone affected by breast cancer. They will team up on some awareness activities, including ABCD Night for \"The Moors\" on Nov. 7.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'Thomas Lane was visibly sick. His clothing hung loose, his complexion seemed blanched, his vision blurred in and out. Already a slight man, he lost 45 pounds in a five-month period.\\nMore than four decades earlier, while in his 20s and serving in the Navy, Lane learned he had bipolar II disorder. For years after his diagnosis, he zigzagged in and out of hospitals, homeless shelters and treatment facilities. He survived two suicide attempts, the most recent, in 1998, so severe his mother flew from Albuquerque to Reno to say goodbye. He had researched his plan, and written goodbye letters to loved ones.\\nWhen he awoke, astonishing the hospital staff, doctors warned he might never be able to see in one eye.\\nSince then, Lane had fully regained his sight, met and married his soulmate, and developed a \"very strong faith\" in God. His work at a health care company, drawing on personal experiences to help patients with mental health issues, gave him energy and purpose. He\\'d been overseeing and leading peer support services for 14 years.\\nBut now, it was the summer of 2020, and he recognized, once again, he was a danger to himself. Reluctantly, he requested a leave. Even though his employer supported him at first, stepping away felt like failure. That, in turn, exacerbated his symptoms.\\nHe believed his time away would be temporary.\\nLane applied for a Family Medical Leave of Absence, the first step to getting long-term disability benefits. FMLA runs concurrently with short-term disability benefits, with the idea that, should workers need to take long-term disability, they still receive a portion of their income in the first weeks. Typically, long-term benefits kick in after a person has been disabled and off work at least 90 days.\\nJust days before he was supposed to return to work, Lane got a call from his manager, saying he had lost his job protection six weeks ago. He didn\\'t understand.\\nAn email from human resources, delivered to him Jan. 27, 2021, informed him that his job protection under FMLA had been exhausted as of Dec. 14, putting him at the \"terminable level\" outlined in his company\\'s policy. Lane was furious. A clock had started in September, and the ticking had stopped three months later without his knowledge.\\nLane thought he had done everything right: He\\'d communicated regularly about his status, and confirmed with his supervisor they had what they needed. \"Why am I just now being made aware of this?\" he wrote.\\nWhat Lane discovered is one symptom of an affliction in the benefits system that impacts about 3.5 million American employees out of work for a behavioral health disability. While insurance for physical ailments has improved steadily, coverage of mental health is decades out of step with the knowledge of its causes, impacts and treatment.\\nProgress toward health coverage parity, in which mental health issues are covered in the same way as physical health issues, has been glacial, even as America\\'s mental health crisis continues to soar.\\nMore:You have a mental health disability. You need coverage and work time off. Brace yourself.\\nTo get a sense of the disparity, the Journal Sentinel analyzed five years of lawsuits, filed between 2019 and 2023 in Wisconsin federal district courts, over the denial of long-term disability claims. More than one-third involved workers with mental health conditions. Some were reeling from the trauma, some coping with catastrophic accidents, and some, like Lane, were struggling to manage severe and persistent mental illnesses.\\nIt\\'s not known exactly how many mental health-related disability claims were filed overall during those years. The Wisconsin Office of the Commissioner of Insurance doesn\\'t process or track disability claims, said Sarah Smith, director of public affairs, largely due to the vast majority of cases being processed by private insurers or employee benefits providers. But nationally, it\\'s estimated that only 7% to 8% of all disability claims are related to mental health.\\nUsing that measure, the percentage of mental health-related lawsuits in the Journal Sentinel sample was far out of proportion, and indicates a much higher denial rate. That reinforces what is accepted as gospel among those involved in the issue.\\nThe insurance denials and sudden terminations of benefits came in part because such disabilities aren\\'t always visible, and psychological pain is deemed subjective. More than that, how we understand, and provide coverage for, mental illness in the workforce is chambered to the past. It reflects a mindset, articulated by one neuropsychologist who spoke with the Journal Sentinel, that a mental illness diagnosis used to be forever, something you didn\\'t come back from the way you could come back from, say, a broken femur.\\nEven the language embedded in disability policies, with references to a \"mental/nervous limitation,\" is a nod to an outdated understanding of behavioral health.\\nRoughly half of working Americans are covered under disability insurance, which provides short- and long-term income protections in the event of a sickness or injury. Those protections ensure that employees receive 50% to 70% of their income while they\\'re out of work.\\nBut the impairment you have changes the scope of those protections.\\nShould someone diagnosed with severe impairments from a stroke become unable to work, they can apply for long-term disability and be protected until retirement. The longest someone with a mental health disability or substance use disorder can take is 24 months, even if, at that point, they\\'re still not capable of work.\\nFewer than 1% of group disability policies sold in the United States have unlimited mental health and substance use disorder benefits, according to a report from an advisory council on Employee Welfare and Pension Benefit Plans, known as the ERISA Advisory Council. ERISA, which stands for Employee Retirement Income Security Act, is the federal tax and labor law, established in 1974 and sets standards for employee benefits plans.\\nMost people don\\'t need more than 24 months to take leave for a mental health condition, said Mark DeBofsky, principal attorney at DeBofsky Law in Chicago, and a member of the 2023 ERISA Advisory Panel. \"But for those who do, those people are no less ill than somebody with stage IV cancer or advanced MS or an intractable spinal impairment or untreatable coronary artery disease,\" DeBofsky said.\\nThe 2023 ERISA Advisory Council raised the question of whether this lack of parity is discriminatory. Its 61-page December 2023 report, the result of a yearlong investigation into the question, recommended the Department of Labor promote the elimination of the 24-month limitation.\\nSeveral U.S. Departments, including Labor, have unveiled rules on expanding mental health parity since then in health insurance. Andrea Palm, deputy secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, told the Journal Sentinel during a visit to Milwaukee Sept. 9 that federal departments are \"very conscious\" that mental health conditions and substance use disorders often co-occur with physical disability issues.\\nBut actually impacting policies, or the way claims are handled, is another matter.\\n\"There\\'s still lots of work to do and and still friction among the requirements for those different programs and services,\" Palm said.\\nIn the last five years, 89 people in Wisconsin filed lawsuits because their long-term disability claims were either denied outright or terminated after 24 months. Of those, 31 had symptoms of a mental health condition. They were grant writers and truck drivers, bankers and nurses, mechanics and customer service reps, personal trainers and program managers.\\nThe Journal Sentinel analysis showed that in many cases, insurance companies hired physicians to review a claimant\\'s medical file and come to a conclusion about their condition — conclusions that often contradicted a claimant\\'s own team of specialists.\\nWisconsin claimants are not alone in facing this hurdle. In every state, an insurance company\\'s hired physician have overruled a provider actually providing treatment.\\nFurther, the 24-month limitation accrues over the course of an employee\\'s tenure with a company. If there are recurrent episodes, the employee would not receive another 24-month period, according to Jessa Victor, a shareholder attorney at the Madison office of Hawks Quindel. Victor specializes in handling employee benefits matters and, primarily, long-term disability claims.\\nVictor has represented hundreds of disability claimants since she joined the law firm in 2018. She learned quickly that, for people appealing the denial of their claims for mental health or addiction, insurers almost always have the upper hand because of \"discretionary clauses.\" In essence, insurance companies are allowed to interpret the provisions of their plans and determine eligibility as they see fit.\\nThe role of the judge in these cases, Victor said, isn\\'t to determine whether someone has a disabling condition and should have been paid benefits. Instead, it comes down to whether the insurance company was reasonable in how it interpreted its own policies.\\n\"It gives the benefit of the doubt to the insurance company\\'s decision, even if a judge disagrees with the decision,\" Victor said. \"If they can\\'t prove that the decision was unreasonable, it has to be upheld.\"\\nDiscretionary clauses are banned in 20 states, including those as ideologically disparate as California and Texas. Wisconsin, however, allows them.\\nIn California, not only are discretionary clauses banned, but only nonprofit professional specialty organizations can make such determinations, said Meiram Bendat, a lawyer from Santa Barbara who authored California\\'s mental health parity law, SB855.\\n\"It\\'s really an idiotic standard that the U.S. Supreme Court allowed to go into effect several decades ago,\" Bendat said. \"The premise that employers and third-party administrators that review their claims are fiduciaries and are acting in patients\\' best interests is an insane proposition. They\\'re acting in their own best interests.\"\\nDuring a work trip to Orlando in July 2019, Shannon received a call from her younger brother. He had been watching her three young boys back home in northern Wisconsin. He informed her they were stranded on a boat in the middle of a lake, the engine dead. Her kids were swimming in the water at dusk, far from the now-free floating boat.\\nHer brother assured her they all had on lifejackets and would be fine. Shannon, however, could not say the same. (Her last name is not being used because she still works at the same company. The Journal Sentinel verified her information.)\\nAs coworkers escorted her to her hotel room, she crumpled in their arms, unable to stop crying. The rest of the day, she paced her hotel room, and that night was unable to sleep. The next morning, she arrived 45 minutes late to a meeting. Her boss mistakenly assumed she\\'d had too much to drink.\\nEleven months earlier, her 37-year-old husband had died in a freak electrocution accident in front of her and her three kids. She was 34 at the time and her boys were 3, 7 and 9 years old.\\nIn the first year after her husband died, \\'I just kept working,\" Shannon said. \"I wasn\\'t sleeping, ever. I was having nightmares all the time, waking up in huge puddles of sweat, like I had just jumped in the pool. My job is not directly supervised, so my issues were not seen by others.\\'\\nWhen she told her psychiatrist what happened on her work trip, he urged her to apply for a short-term disability claim and get three months — October through December — to finally process what had happened.\\nAlmost immediately when she went on leave, problems arose. Nobody from the insurance company returned her psychiatrist\\'s calls about paperwork they wanted. Shannon made contact, but was told the insurance company required doctor-to-doctor communication, and she didn\\'t have access to her medical documents anyway.\\nThen, a flurry of letters began. If she didn\\'t immediately return to work, her insurance company stated, she would be terminated. By that point, when Shannon talked to her psychiatrist, it wasn\\'t about processing her husband\\'s death and treating her PTSD, it was about dealing with her insurance situation.\\nIn January 2020, Shannon returned to work, where an email was waiting for her. Her company said her leave had never been approved by her insurance company and now she owed her company $23,000 in pay she had received while out.\\nA back-and-forth argument continued. In June 2020, her insurance company called for an independent medical exam of Shannon.\\n\"I\\'m confused as to what a doctor is going to be determining about my mental health issues from 6-9 months ago. I feel like this is an effort to discredit me and/or my doctor,\" Shannon wrote in an email to her attorneys.\\nHer attorneys told her to produce the police report detailing her husband\\'s death, which would help her case. She had never read it, and though she accepted that it could make her case stronger, going over it re-traumatized her.\\nFinally, Shannon won approval for the disability leave she had taken months earlier. She still had to pay $4,306, a result of a clerical issue. Plus she had to pay legal fees.\\n\"When someone in the military goes overseas, sees someone they\\'ve known for three to six months get shot, and comes home with PTSD, that\\'s accepted,\" Shannon said. \"But somehow it\\'s a question whether my spouse of 16 years dying violently in front of me and my children is going to cause PTSD. All I asked for was 12 weeks off.\"\\nThomas Lane, 64, sat in his Wisconsin Dells home on a drizzly August afternoon, his 14-year-old golden retriever Millie whimpering nearby.\\nEach time Millie made a sound, Lane perked up, asking if she needed to go outside or have some food. Some days, Lane said, caring for his aging and disabled dog is the only reason he can think of to stay alive.\\nLane ultimately won his appeal. For 12 months, the maximum allowed time per his employer policy, he received 60% of his income. Now that it\\'s run out, he picks up work where he can — helping his wife with invoices at her company, attempting to sell woodcrafts at fairs. He\\'s also able to collect Social Security Disability Insurance payments, which took eight months to get approved.\\n\"I just was trying to do what I could do at the time. I can\\'t work now. I wish I could,\" Lane said.\\n\"I would sell my soul to not have a bipolar disorder.\"\\nNatalie Eilbert is reporting on problems at the intersection of disability insurance and mental health through a grant from theUSC Annenberg Center for Health Journalism\\'s 2024 National Fellowship Fund.

Then it seemed he was a little tentative on his breaking stuff.\"\\nAshby entered the game with the score tied at 4-4, two outs already on the board and the heart of the New York order due up.\\n\"The intention is to absolutely come in and strike them out and get out of there as fast as we can,\" Ashby said of his mindset after taking the ball from Joel Payamps. \"Then, things kind of happened.\"\\nAshby opened against Brandon Nimmo, the Mets\\' No. 3 hitter, and got ahead in the count, 1-2, before leaving a 99-mph sinker in the middle of the plate that was slapped to left field to load the bases.\\nMark Vientos followed by taking Ashby\\'s next pitch, a 98.8 mph sinker up but again over the plate, to right. That scored a pair and gave New York a lead it wouldn\\'t relinquish.\\nThat brought the Mets\\' most dangerous hitter, Pete Alonso, to the plate and after Ashby fell behind, 2-0, Murphy elected to put him on to again load the bases with the left-handed-hitting Jesse Winker due up.\\nNew York manager Carlos Mendoza responded by pulling Winker in favor of J.D. Martinez – one of the majors\\' most accomplished hitters over the last decade – and after getting ahead, 0-2, Ashby left a curveball out over the plate that Martinez also sent to right.\\nTwo more runs scored to make it 8-4, and the air had been totally let out of the ballpark.\\nA four-pitch walk to Starling Marte followed, and Ashby was done for the night.\\n\"There\\'s definitely some pitches in there that weren\\'t executed the way that I expect and that we expect to be executed,\" Ashby said. \"A lot of two-strike hits. (Need) better strike execution in those situations.\\n\"Disappointing for sure.\"\\nNick Mears finished the inning by getting Tyrone Taylor to fly out. But the damage done against both Payamps and Ashby turned the game completely around just a half-inning after the Brewers\\' offense had grabbed a 4-3 lead and re-energized the crowd of 40,022.\\n\"You saw 97 and 99,\" Murphy said of Ashby. \"Him and Payamps, along with (Trevor) Megill and (Devin) Williams, those are four of the best relievers in the game if you do the numbers.\\n\"So, I was pretty confident with Payamps, one (inning), Ashby, two. Megill and Williams were good. It didn\\'t work that way.\"\\nTaking a step back and looking at the entirety of a season isn\\'t easy to do not long after such a deflating loss.\\nBut after going 4-7 with an 8.04 ERA and WHIP of 2.00 in 25 appearances (14 starts before shifting to relief in early August) at Class AAA Nashville, Ashby rebounded to go 1-2 with a 2.86 ERA and 1.06 WHIP in 14 appearances (including two spot starts, one in April and one in June).\\nIt\\'s a great foundation for the 26-year-old to build off of heading into 2025; perhaps another attempt at starting will be in the cards as well.\\nBut all Ashby is focused on right now is Milwaukee winning its next two games to stay alive. A chance at redemption would be terrific as well, with Ashby having thrown only 18 pitches on Tuesday.',\n",

       "   'summary': \"MADISON – A look back at Wisconsin's 52-6 victory over Purdue Saturday at Camp Randall Stadium.\\nThe Badgers can exhale now. After tough losses to Alabama and USC, they scored a much-needed win and did so in convincing fashion. The 46-point margin of victory was Wisconsin's largest since a 52-3 win at Rutgers in 2021. UW's point and yardage totals (589) were the most since that game as well.\\nThe Badgers also got 359 passing yards from Braedyn Locke and gained a season-high 5.6 yards per carry. Meanwhile, the defense held the Boilermakers to 216 total yards, the lowest total of the Luke Fickell era, and 4.5 yards per play, the lowest for a UW opponent this season.\\nThe performance helps put into perspective where the Badgers stand after facing a couple of upper-echelon teams. It was a good performance to build on with back-to-back road games coming up against Rutgers and Northwestern.\\n'I know it's been tough on these guys,' UW coach Luke Fickell said. 'You can see 21-, 22-year-olds in the locker room acting like 13, 14-year-olds just because of the sheer fact that they care, they work, they want nothing but the best and they all understand nothing is guaranteed to us.'\\nThe offense stole the show, but the defense saved the day during the second quarter.\\nLocke was picked off twice in the quarter and each time Purdue reached the red zone. The first time it had first and goal at the 9. The second time it had first and goal at the 4. Each time the Badgers defense held to force a field goal.\\nUW emerged from its worst stretch of the game still ahead, 14-6.\\n'There's a lot of things about the game, but that to me is really where the difference in the ball game is,' Fickell said. 'When you can do that and hold them, and that is a big thing for the defense, but even offensively when they look at guys like that and they're like it's not all on our shoulders.'\\nMore: 'Dairy Raid': Wisconsin football alums react to Badgers' feel-good win over Purdue, give offense new nickname\\n* For the third time this season an opponent muffed an Atticus Bertrams punt. He drilled a 52-yard punt that Dillon Thieneman couldn't handle and was recovered by Cayson Pfeiffer. One play later Tawee Walker scored on a 12-yard run.\\n* Jake Chaney finished with four tackles, including two for a loss, but he also played a key role in two key first half stops. He got the initial pressure on Sebastian Cheeks' first sack as a Badger in the first quarter, a play that put the Boilermakers behind schedule and led to a punt. Chaney also got the initial push of Devin Mockobee's third down run near the goal line that was stopped short of a first down.\\n* Freshman Kevin Heywood stepped in at left tackle in the second half for Jack Nelson and held his own.\\n* Senior Kamo'i Latu, who got buried on the depth chart as he recovered from injuries in the spring and fall camp, forced a fourth-quarter fumble that led to a Nathanial Vakos field goal.\\n* The receiving corps showed depth. Not only did Trech Kekahuna (six catches, 134) have a career day but C.J. Williams had a career-high 60 yards on four catches.\\n* Running back Tawee Walker didn't have a negative carry on the way to a 19-carry, 94-yard, three touchdown afternoon.\\n* One week after struggling to get off the field, the UW defense held Purdue to a 1-for-11 conversion rate on third down.\\n* The defense bailed him out, but Locke' second interception was the result of a poorly thrown ball.\\n* Nickel back Max Lofy's was flagged for a holding on a third-and-13 play that helped keep alive the Boilermakers first scoring drive.\\nThe Badgers head to Piscataway, New Jersey, to face a much-improved team Rutgers team that entered play Saturday with a 4-0 record for the first time since 2012.\\nThe Scarlet Knights are of the nation's best teams when it comes running the ball and controlling the clock. Senior Kyle Monangai ranked third in the nation with 147.3 yards per game.\",\n",

The Boilermakers will be breaking in a new offensive coordinator/play caller and are facing a program it hasn't been able to beat since 2003. The Badgers are battle-tested, back at home and poised to show strides after back-to-back losses to Alabama and USC. This is the week UW gets back on track. Wisconsin 31, Purdue 17.\\nThis is the week some faith gets restored in the Badgers program, not because anyone will be impressed with a one-sided win over Purdue, but because the team is finally going to play four complete quarters and apply the lessons learned from two losses against Alabama and USC. A shakeup in the running back room has taken one of the team's leaders out of the equation, but it's also opened a new opportunity for someone (Cade Yacamelli? Darrion Dupree?) to rise up and make a splash. Also, after the Packers and Brewers losses last week, everyone is due for a little pendulum swing, are we not?

This service will be completed for free. Recall notification letters are expected to be sent by Nov. 25. Owners may contact Tesla customer service at 1-877-798-3752.

If the vehicle has a loose applique, it can detach from the vehicle. When this happens it can create a road hazard for other drivers and increase the risk of a crash.\\nFor the front windshield wiper failure, Tesla recalled 11,688 of its Cybertruck vehicles.

       "   'summary': \"When Tobias Myers goes back into the clubhouse postgame after one of his starts, he always checks his phone to see what texts his mother, Angela, sent him.\\nMyers has gotten used to the little message bubbles that are sitting on his lockscreen, short but emphatic notes sent mid-game in the heat of the action, typically revolving around a similar theme of throwing more strikes.\\nWhen Myers got back to his locker Thursday night at the conclusion of Game 3 of the National League wild-card series, there were no messages sitting there from his mom.\\n'She only texts me when she's watching on TV,' Myers said.\\nIt wasn't just that, either. Myers' start was so impeccable that there would have been nothing to critique.\\nMyers took the ball for the Milwaukee Brewers in the decisive game against the New York Mets and, with his family in attendance at American Family Field, delivered a start that, had the ninth inning not gone disastrously wrong, would have been arguably the key performance that pushed the club to its first playoff series win in five tries.\\nThe right-hander delivered five shutout innings, striking out five and allowing only two hits as he maneuvered the lineup of the team with the highest payroll in baseball with both passion and ease in Milwaukee's 4-2 loss to the Mets.\\nMyers' fastball sat at 95 mph and topped out at 97 mph, a couple ticks firmer than it had been all season. His slider was sharp. That, along with pinpoint precision, was just about all he needed to shut down the Mets through two turns of the batting order.\\n'He emptied the tank there in the fifth,' manager Pat Murphy said. 'His last few outings were a little shorter. He emptied the tank in the fifth, and he was tremendous. I'm really proud of that young man, all he's been through.'\\nIt was the cherry on top of a career-altering season for Myers.\\nThe 26-year-old had been with five organizations already before coming to the Brewers on a two-year minor-league deal before the 2023 season. He was coming off a year in which he had been designated for assignment three times and ultimately released.\\nHe spent nearly all of last season at Class AA Biloxi, where he struggled mightily coming out of the gates, but began to find his groove late in the year with his new organization. When the Brewers rotation was ravaged by injuries early this season, it was Myers, off to a strong start at Class AAA Nashville, that got the call.\\nTwenty-seven games and a 3.00 earned run average in the regular season – and one heck of a playoff start – later, he had entrenched himself as a future cornerstone of Milwaukee's rotation.\\n'Super grateful for the opportunity,' is how Myers summed up his wild ride this year. 'Excited for the future.'\\nThursday night was Myers' magnum opus, showing not only he could spin off filthy pitches with his right arm but could seize the magnitude of the moment with dogged determinism and a cool exterior.\\n'That one had some sting on it':Social media reaction to Brewers' crushing playoff loss\\nJake Bauers, Sal Frelick:They were set up to be postseason heroes before Brewers' ninth-inning collapse\\n'He's not scared,' said first baseman Rhys Hoskins. 'He's been through a lot the last couple of years of his career, trying to figure out who he is. That's who he is. He showed that throughout this year. He showed he belonged.'\\nThe Brewers, if they didn't already, now know what they have for years to come.\",\n",

Deputies found Strite in a wooded area in De Soto after receiving a report of human skeletal remains found by the property owner, according to the sheriff\\'s office.\\nInvestigators with the Regional Medical Examiners compared medical and dental records and determined the remains belonged to Strite, the sheriff\\'s office said. Strite\\'s cause of death is undetermined, and investigators are working to determine how her body ended up where it was found, according to a news release.\\nHere\\'s what to know about Strite\\'s disappearance.\\nCharlyn McClain, Strite\\'s mother, told NBC\\'s Dateline she has not spoken to her daughter since April 12. Strite had gone to go stay with a friend in De Soto after she traveled over the Missouri border to Cahokia, Illinois to visit her children at their father\\'s home, according to McClain.\\nMcClain said she became worried when Strite\\'s children\\'s father, Steve Fults, called her about a week later and asked if she had heard from her daughter.\\n\"He has never called me and questioned anything about Emily or to tell me anything about Emily,\" McClain said, per NBC News. \"That\\'s why I panicked when he called me because he had never done that before.\"\\nMcClain filed a missing persons report with the Jefferson County Sheriff\\'s Office shortly after Fults\\' call.\\nStrite was last seen on the morning of April 12 leaving the De Soto area on foot, believed to be on her own free will, the Jefferson County Sheriff\\'s Office shared in a Facebook post on April 25.\\nChristi Bauman, who identified herself as Strite\\'s best friend, told KSDK that it was unusual for Strite not to contact anyone for days.\\n\"It wasn\\'t like her to never contact somebody within usually three to five days, especially her mom,\" Bauman said, per KSDK. \"And when she hadn\\'t contacted her mom, she had a gut feeling. I also knew in my gut something was wrong.\"\\nMcClain spoke to KDSK after she learned of her daughter\\'s death.\\n\\'I had hope, but then again as a mom, I really knew she wasn\\'t here, she never not called me,\" McClain said, per the St. Louis-based TV station. \\'I wanted her found.

       "   'excerpt': 'After retaining this one manual part longer than anyone else, this model at least holds onto another a little longer.',\n",
       "   'summary': \"Compared to the original Jeep — you know, the military vehicle — the 2025 Wrangler JL is a spaceship, even though by modern standards it's a very old-school vehicle when compared to, say, the Ford Bronco or Toyota 4Runner. But father time, or, at least, father progress, is starting to catch up with the Wrangler, which is finally losing its manual crank-handle windows (as does the 2025 Gladiator, the Wrangler's de-facto pickup sibling). The good news for anyone yearning for yesteryear is that the manual six-speed transmission is still around, even though for 2025 it becomes the only transmission choice for the Wrangler's standard V-6 engine. Want an automatic? You're automatically upgraded to the Jeep's optional turbocharged 2.0-liter I-4.\\nIt's probably a bit of a reach to say that the Wrangler JL is a stone-age vehicle. It features a modern five-link suspension system, electronic lockers and nearly as much technology as those two aforementioned competitors do. The new JL also comes as a plug-in hybrid (PHEV) powerplant, something that the 4Runner is only just getting with its i-Force Max hybrid engine — just without the plug-in option — while the Bronco still doesn't have an electrified version, yet. Oh, and there's its newly standard 12.3-inch touchscreen that can magic-whiz-bang connect wirelessly to your smartphone.\\nAnd yet, the Wrangler's continued use of live axles front and rear, doors that can easily be removed and generally simple layout give it that old-school feeling that made the standard crank windows not seem so out of place.\\n2024 Jeep Wrangler 4xe Dispatcher:This new concept is a retro-inspired off-road hybrid\\nAlas, time moves on. The Jeep's previously optional power windows and door locks are now standard fare. Whatever cost increase these represent on Jeep's end are probably more than made up for by the streamlined trim structure and reduced build complexity — no more producing different doors for different Wranglers. And, fortunately, it won't make taking the doors off any harder, really. As with all power-window, power-door-lock Wranglers until now, you need only unclip an electrical connector in addition to the usual unbolting process for the hinges.\\nThe other good news for those who like to have everything in their control is that the 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6 will now come coupled exclusively to a six-speed manual transmission. The automatic transmission option for that engine has been dropped, meaning those who want a computer doing their shifting will need to opt for the turbocharged 2.0-liter I-4 engine; the pair costs $2,500 on every trim level save the Sahara, where it's standard, and the plug-in hybrid 4xe and Wrangler 392 models, where the gas-only 2.0-liter isn't available (because, you know, one has the plug-in version of the 2.0-liter and the other gets a 6.4-liter Hemi V-8, both of which retain their eight-speed automatics).\\nA reminder that the 4xe blends the 2.0-liter and an electric motor to deliver 375 hp and 470 lb-ft of torque, but you won't be able to get it in the stripped-out Sport trim. The 4xe starts at the Sport S and will be available for every trim after — except the Rubicon 392, of course — including the new High Altitude that will become available later this year. It also gains an exclusive Black/Mantis Green interior color.\\nNew Jeep Cherokee:It's all but guaranteed and it can't come soon enough\\nFinally, a new color for 2025 is available known as ''41,' an olive drab green from the Jeep '41 Concept of the 2022 Easter Jeep Safari. It's a perfect way to celebrate its GP heritage with a proper, factory-applied military-style green body color and joins the seven other body colors of Anvil, Black, Bright White, Fathom Blue, Firecracker Red, Granite Crystal and Hydro Blue.\",\n",

       "   'summary': 'Arriving at James Madison high school on Thursday evening, teachers and parents wanted answers: Is Milwaukee Public Schools planning to close some of its buildings?\\n\"You\\'re saying, \\'Merge a school, and give that one school more investment,\" said the parent of a 12-year-old student during the public town hall on MPS\\' long-range facilities master plan. \"Versus putting investment in each and every school and community.\"\\nThursday night\\'s event at the James Madison Academic Campus auditorium on the city\\'s northwest attracted about 60 teachers, parents and other community members. It was the fourth in a series of six community meetings to gather public input on the plan.\\nRepresentatives from Perkins Eastman, the consulting firm hired by MPS to aid in its facilities planning, presented data that showed 1 in 4 MPS schools are under-filled and another 1 in 4 are overcrowded.\\nOver the next decade, the district is considering changes that would better spread its students and academic programs across its 144 schools — which will likely mean closing and merging some schools while upgrading others, according to early plans.\\nBut, there are no details yet about what will happen to each school.\\nIn a question-and-answer session Thursday, many from the MPS community pushed for details about the next steps. They wanted to know how MPS plans to decide which schools could close, what will happen to shuttered buildings, when more details will be available, and whether closures are necessary in the first place, among other questions.\\n\"I\\'ve got two little ones, a second-grader and a fifth-grader. How can we buy in and say we\\'re going to keep our kids here in high school, in MPS?\" said another parent, a father with five children. \"These are dramatic changes.\"\\nMore: Future of MPS could include school closures, improved programming under long-range facilities plan\\nOne main factor that could determine a school\\'s future is its \"utilization rate,\" or what percentage of the building is being used, according to information presented by Perkins Eastman.\\nSchools with a utilization rate below 50% are more likely to be marked for potential closure. Across Milwaukee\\'s 144 schools, one quarter — 36 — are half-empty.\\nThat is one of many factors being taken into account. Perkins Eastman is using a preliminary tool to categorize schools called a \"sorting tree.\"\\nThe first question in the sorting process is whether a school has a 50% or above utilization rate. If the answer is no, the next question is whether the school has seen enrollment growth in the past five years. If the answer is no again, the final question is whether that school is within 1 mile of another under-filled school.\\nIf the answer is yes, the school could be marked for closure or merger.\\nDepending on their situations, schools could be marked for new academic programs or building upgrades, among other options.\\n\"I want to be very clear that 50% is not a determining number,\" said Patrick Davis, a principal with the consulting firm. \"That 50% only gets you so far. It gets you to a candidate group, where we need to do a lot more evaluation.\"\\nSpeaking during the question-and-answer session Thursday, an MPS teacher told the crowd she is concerned that shutting down schools in high-needs parts of Milwaukee will leave students stranded.\\n\"You\\'re ripping the carpet out from some of our underserved, highly trauma-informed students,\" the teacher said. \"Where are (those kids) going to go, if their one source of stability is gone? How is that really going to help them?\"\\nAnother teacher, who said it\\'s her second year with MPS, said she wants to see the district invest in schools before shutting them down.\\n\"At the school where I\\'m at now, we don\\'t really offer any extracurriculars,\" the teacher said. \"The attendance rate is very low here, as well, and I think that is a viable reason why.\"\\nFor nearly an hour, Davis took questions from teachers, parents and other community members.\\nHe stressed that school capacity, enrollment trends over the past five years and location in Milwaukee are just preliminary factors being used to determine whether a school will shut down. There is no intention to \"leave communities empty of schools,\" Davis said.\\nDavis said it\\'s true that investing in a school\\'s programs, like extracurriculars, could help reverse declining enrollment. But he also said doing so for all MPS schools isn\\'t financially possible.\\n\"The reality is public school funding — not just MPS, any district — there are constraints around funding availablity,\" Davis said.\\nOver time, MPS has been losing students. One analysis charted a 33% enrollment drop between 2006 and 2024, a loss of about 30,000 students. At the same time, enrollment in publicly funded charters and private schools has increased, according to data from the Wisconsin Policy Forum.\\nSome speakers on Thursday wanted answers about how the facilities plan will take that big-picture trend into account.\\n\"Where are the children?\" said a speaker who described herself as a 1998 graduate of North Division High School. \"You guys have a 10-year plan as to how you\\'re going to close the schools, but no plan as to how you\\'re going to get children back into MPS.\"\\nAnother challenge facing MPS, according to Perkins Eastman\\'s analysis, is how to evenly spread students across Milwaukee. While dozens of schools are under-filled, just as many are too crowded. Some schools have been forced to pack 40 students into a classroom, or convert art and music rooms into regular classrooms just to make space, according to the presentation.\\nAcademic programs are not evenly spread across Milwaukee schools, either, according to the presentation.

       "   'summary': 'October is LGBT History Month, and the Milwaukee Public Museum is recognizing the occasion with a new guided tour, \"Beyond Binaries: LGBTQ+ Histories through Time and Place.\"\\nThe tour will start in the Streets of Old Milwaukee, where visitors will learn a bit about the city\\'s LGBTQ history, then it will branch out to the second and third floors of the museum as the guide discusses different ways various cultures understand (or have understood) gender and sexuality.\\nAl Hughes, a member of the museum\\'s education team, took the lead on researching the tour. In a recent interview with the Journal Sentinel, Hughes described what tourists can expect.\\nThe idea of the tour is that we can step outside our own modern Midwestern worldview and learn about different ways that different people and cultures worldwide perceive gender and gender diversity.\\nOne of the main themes is how our language is constructed based on our ideas of sexuality and gender. Like, in the Western world, our language (for example, with male and female pronouns) has a certain boxed-in quality to it. But in other places, the language has a lot more built-in fluidity as far as gender is concerned.\\nLike, when the tour is on the second floor of the museum, we\\'ll be talking about two-spirit individuals across the United States and how many Native tribes, and a lot of different cultures in general, don\\'t have just male and female genders; they also have third genders in their language and understanding.\\nAnd, on the third floor, we\\'ll talk about a culture in Hawaii where the pronoun system doesn\\'t even designate he and she to refer to people; there\\'s just one pronoun so the idea of gender fluidity is engrained in the language.\\nThe construction of language affects how we think about different things, and our perception of how we see ourselves. And when you realize how people label things differently in different languages, you understand how different people\\'s perspectives can be.\\nWe\\'ll talk about a few ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs that portray what we today believe to be a gay relationship between two men. And we\\'ll go over the controversy of how a lot of people in academia from decades ago went through a lot of interesting justifications to try to explain away portrayals of gay relationships, and why the consensus today is that they most likely were in a relationship.\\nWe\\'ll talk about some of the pre-colonial systems in African countries where a lot of times, gender was more tied to social status and life stages. Like, for example, motherhood was considered its own distinct type of gender in a way.\\nOne of the final stops will be in the China exhibit where we\\'ll talk about the Golden Orchid Society in southern China where, if a woman wanted to avoid getting married to a man, she could join this organization of women, and sometimes be allowed to marry another woman. The idea was that it was much better for families to have a married daughter, period. And if that meant being married to another woman, so be it; that was considered better than having an unwed-able daughter.\\nWe\\'ll be looking at some figures from Milwaukee history, like Ralph Kerwineo, who is thought to be the first recorded transgender man in Wisconsin. He started dressing as a man for work, and eventually felt more comfortable in a male world. He ended up getting arrested while living in Milwaukee (in 1914).\\nWe\\'ll also make a stop to talk about Kittie Williams (who operated a brothel that is represented in the Streets of Old Milwaukee). In her tavern in the red light district, she served gay men and many people saw it as a safe space to gather.\\nMilwaukee Public Museum Guide:The Milwaukee Public Museum is moving in 2027. In the meantime, here\\'s what to know if you visit',\n",

Musgrave did not participate in practice this week, meaning his role against the Rams may be limited.\\nThe Packers are also without receiver Romeo Doubs, who was suspended Saturday for conduct detrimental to the team after skipping practice Thursday and Friday. Without Watson and Doubs, and with Musgrave likely limited, Love likely will rely heavily on receivers Jayden Reed and Dontayvion Wicks as well as tight end Tucker Kraft.

       "   'summary': 'WASHINGTON – Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said he \"misspoke\" on longstanding claims that he was in Hong Kong in the spring of 1989 when the Tiananmen Square massacre left hundreds dead.\\nRecently discovered news reports from Nebraska showed the Democratic vice presidential nominee was actually in the United States during that time and left for China that summer, after the massacre.\\nAsked to explain that discrepancy during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate Tuesday night, Walz struggled to succinctly answer.\\n\"I have tried to do the best I can,\" he said. \"I have not been perfect, and I\\'m a knucklehead at times.\"\\nHe said he learned a lot from his time in China, and that it was evidenced in his career in public service.\\n\"Many times I will talk a lot, I will get caught up in the rhetoric,\" he said. \"Being there, the impact it made, the difference it made in my life, I learned a lot about China.\"\\n\"I got there that summer and misspoke,\" he concluded.\\nWalz cited the anecdote during a 2014 Congressional hearing, saying he was in Hong Kong in May 1989. \"And as the events were unfolding, several of us went in. And I still remember the train station in Hong Kong,\" he said at the time. He repeated the claim on a podcast as recently as February.\\nBut local news reports resurfaced by conservative news outlet the Washington Free Beacon indicate he was still in Nebraska at that time.\\nThe Alliance (Neb.) Times-Herald featured a photo of Walz touring a Nebraska National Guard storeroom on May 16, 1989. The photo\\'s caption says Walz \"will take over the job\" of staffing the storeroom from a retiring guardsman and \"will be moving to Alliance,\" Nebraska, CNN reported.\\nAnother newspaper article published by a Nebraska-based outlet in April 1989 reported that Walz planned on traveling to China in early August, a month after the protests ended. Minnesota Public Radio News and APM Reports first reported the possible contradiction.\\nFact Check:What Tim Walz, JD Vance got right (and wrong) in the VP debate\\nWalz may have also been misleading about how often he has traveled to China. During a 2016 interview, the governor said he has visited the country \"about 30 times.\" Additionally, he told the Congressional-Executive Commission on China in 2016 that he went to Hong Kong \"dozens and dozens and dozens of times.\"\\nRepublicans have been critical of Walz\\'s connection to China. House Oversight Chairman James Comer subpoenaed Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Monday for documents related to the governor possibly having ties to the Chinese Communist Party.\\n\"Throughout his career, Governor Walz has stood up to the (Chinese Communist Party), fought for human rights and democracy, and always put American jobs and manufacturing first,\" the Harris campaign said in a statement to Minnesota Public Radio.\\n\\'Republicans are twisting basic facts and desperately lying to distract from the Trump-Vance agenda: praising dictators, and sending American jobs to China.\"',\n",

       "   'summary': 'Editor\\'s Note: If the form isn\\'t loading, please try refreshing the page.\\nAs of 11:30 p.m., more than 90,000 people across the country responded to our USA TODAY Network poll asking who won tonight\\'s vice-presidential debate. About 55% gave the edge to Ohio Sen. JD Vance, who is Donald Trump\\'s running mate on the Republican ticket. About 45% gave the nod to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Kamala Harris\\'s running mate on the Democratic side.\\nHere are some quick takes on tonight\\'s debate:\\n➤Tim Walz. \"JD Vance had a problem when being fact checked, lied about his position on abortion and refused to answer if Trump had lost the election.\" — Jean from Suring, Wisconsin.\\n➤JD Vance. \"Smart. Precise. Humble. Polite.\" — Kim from Aurora, Illinois.\\n➤\"Walz. He demonstrated clarity and stayed on track with policy. He was a gentleman and accorded Vance courtesy and worked diligently to demonstrate that compromise can be made with someone you fundamentally disagree with.\" — Kim from Jacksonville, Florida.\\n➤\"JD Vance was poised, professional, and intelligent. He showed warmth and sounded reasonable. I am a Republican who does not like Trump\\'s personality, and I was thinking of voting third party, but Vance may have talked me into voting for Trump.\" — Bob from Hattiesburg, Mississippi.\\nWhat issues did viewers wish had more debate time? What are their parting thoughts? Here is a sampling of answers:\\n➤\"Project 2025! Actual economic records, not rhetoric. The very very real threat one of the candidates poses to the foundations of our democracy. More fact checking! Please absolutely allow more fact checking when blatant misleading comments are stated as fact.\" — Jason, from Milwaukee, who thought Walz won the debate.\\n➤\"Ukraine, longshoreman strike economic policies. Moderators very uneven in question emphasis and factchecking Trump without allowing Vance rebuttal. But Vance still more than held his own.\" — Mark, from Baldwin, Pennsylvania, who thought Vance won the debate.\\n➤\"Ukraine support and infrastructure. Also lack of details on taxes. I wish Walz had pushed back on the Economy that Biden/Harris inherited an economy in tatters while Trump inherited a good strong economy. For Vance to say Trump saved the Affordable Care Act, that there was a peaceful transfer of power and he never supported a federal abortion ban made a mockery of the truth.\" — James, from Elmhurst, Illinois, who thought Walz won the debate\\nAs Tim Walz and JD Vance face off in their vice presidential debate tonight, we want to hear from you: Who won?\\nWalz, the governor of Minnesota, is the Democratic nominee for vice president. Vance, a U.S. Senator from Ohio, is the Republican nominee. Tonight\\'s debate is set to start about 8 p.m. CT and is scheduled to run for 90 minutes with two commercial breaks. It is being hosted by CBS News in New York and will be moderated by Nora O\\'Donnell, the anchor of the CBS evening news, and Margaret Brennan, the host of Face the Nation.\\nRemember, you can click in the form to see the answers, and keep reading if you want to share more feedback on the debate.

       "   'summary': 'How does UW chancellor and technical college president pay compare? The answer may surprise you\\nUniversity of Wisconsin chancellors are likely to earn bonuses this school year under a new system that could add more than $40,000 to most of their compensation packages.\\nThe move this summer by the UW Board of Regents drew criticism from UW employees at some of the state\\'s 13 public universities, several of which are grappling with deficits, layoffs and campus closures.\\nSome of the state\\'s technical college presidents also earn five-figure bonuses — and have for several years, according to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel analysis. Their pay is also on par with, and in some cases surpasses, regional UW chancellor compensation. But this trend has gone relatively unnoticed.\\nEach of the 16 technical college presidents reports to their own local board, which typically approves compensation increases behind closed doors and without any local media calling attention to it.\\nThe Wisconsin Technical College System has its own board and administrative staff. However, the system office said it does not keep a centralized database with salary information on its 16 presidents.\\nThe Journal Sentinel collected salary information from technical colleges through public records requests to get a sense of compensation among public higher education leaders in Wisconsin in the 2023-24 school year.\\nHere\\'s six takeaways from our analysis:\\nAverage technical college president compensation package outpaces regional UW chancellors\\nUW-Madison and UW-Milwaukee are classified as Research 1 institutions, meaning their missions are not only to educate students with four-year degrees, master\\'s and doctorates, but to produce a high level of research. Remove both universities from the picture, and there are 11 comprehensive UW four-year universities remaining, with an average chancellor compensation package of $318,702.\\nThe state\\'s two-year colleges have a different mission, providing both two-year associate\\'s degrees as well as technical diplomas, adult education classes and other more workforce-focused programs.\\nSeven of the technical college presidents receive more than the highest paid of the UW chancellors outside of UW-Milwaukee and UW-Madison. The average compensation package among the technical college presidents was $327,947. The average would likely be even higher if vehicle and travel allowances were included in the analysis.\\nLooking just at base salary for Wisconsin technical college presidents, the median was $258,646.\\nThat\\'s on par with the $258,706 national median base salary for a president at a public associate-degree granting institution in 2023-24, according to an American Association of University Professors report.\\nFor regional UW chancellors, their median base salary was $287,061. That\\'s well below the national median of $350,000.\\nHousing, annuities boost compensation packages\\nThe list of potential benefits for higher education leaders is long: five-figure retirement packages, relocation bonuses and vehicles.\\nUW chancellors receive a housing allowance in addition to their base salary. Last year\\'s allowance totaled $30,432, or $2,536 each month. (The UW-Madison chancellor is the only chancellor provided a house, so she does not receive an allowance.)\\nMost UW chancellors also receive a leased vehicle for work-related travel. The leaders can drive the vehicle for personal use, too, provided they reimburse the universities for their personal mileage.\\nTechnical college boards have taken a different approach, with most boards providing presidents with a vehicle allowance. The annual allowances ranged from $12,000 to $21,000, though the Journal Sentinel did not include these in the analysis because of uncertainty in how the allowances are paid out.\\nAnnuities are another way in which technical college compensation differs from UW. All but but one of the 16 technical college presidents last year earned an annuity, which is an additional payment the local board pays into a president\\'s annuity fund, often to be used in retirement.\\nThe average annuity among technical college presidents was $53,887. Madison Area Technical College president Jack Daniels earned the largest, a $121,150 payment.\\nUW chancellors must hit goals to earn bonuses. At tech colleges, the process can be more opaque\\nOver the summer, the UW Board of Regents created a new performance-based system awarding chancellors bonuses based on meeting goals that may change from year to year.\\nUW System spokesperson Ethan Schuh said that while regional UW chancellors trail in compensation to the technical colleges for top leadership, they fell even further behind compared to university peers in other states. He said the performance-based incentives were a way to attract and retain leaders while ensuring \"we are best positioned to serve students and taxpayers alike.\"\\nThis year\\'s metric is freshmen retention rates. The bonuses cannot exceed up to 15% of their base salaries, and UW-Madison is not a part of the system.\\nThe Wisconsin Technical College System has a centralized public board, but no policies related to presidential bonuses. Those decisions rest with each college\\'s independent public board, some of which do not have policies related to bonus pay.\\nThe board overseeing Milwaukee Area Technical College, for example, does not have a formal policy related to presidential bonuses, according to board chair Mark Foley.\\nAt Milwaukee Area Technical College, $180,000 in bonuses over the past five years\\nDespite the lack of policy, the MATC board awarded five-figure bonuses to its most recent former president, Vicki Martin, in each of the last five years.\\nIn her 10th and final year as president in 2023-24, Martin was paid a $274,343 base salary. Her total compensation package rose to more than $416,000 when accounting for a $90,000 retirement annuity, $12,000 travel allowance and $40,000 bonus.\\nMartin\\'s pay was \"a punch in the gut\" to Local 212, the union representing MATC faculty and professional staff, according to Lisa Conley, president of Local 212, the union representing MATC faculty and professional staff. One part-time faculty member said during a union meeting the $40,000 bonus could have \"paid for three of me in the classroom.\"\\nMartin retired this summer. Her successor, Anthony Cruz, earns a base salary of $285,000, with a $15,000 travel allowance, and $55,000 in retirement annuity. Moving from Florida for the job, he also received a $20,000 relocation bonus.\\nMATC spokesperson Darryll Fortune said Cruz\\'s compensation was appropriate, noting MATC is the largest of the state\\'s technical colleges and competes nationally against other large, urban two-year institutions for talent.\\nFortune questioned the Journal Sentinel\\'s methodology because the two largest and most complex UW institutions were removed from the average salary calcuation comparison while the two largest technical colleges were included.\\nThe state technical college system declined to comment on the Journal Sentinel\\'s findings.\\nMore: Growing MATC\\'s reach, changing the perception of college are among big goals for MATC\\'s new president, Anthony Cruz\\nHigher pay for fewer students? Depends on how you count enrollment\\nAt first glance, it looks like technical college presidents are getting paid similarly or even more than UW chancellors to oversee fewer students.\\nBut that depends on how enrollment is counted.\\nUW universities tend to rely on the number of full-time equivalent students. Under this method, two students each taking half of a full courseload would be counted as one full-time equivalent student.\\nTechnical colleges prefer headcount enrollment, which counts every student even if they are taking a single class. Most students at the state\\'s two-year schools earn credits part time.\\nLittle research on pay of community and technical college leaders\\nWisconsin\\'s two-year public colleges are among the best-funded of their kind nationally, according to a report by the nonpartisan Wisconsin Policy Forum last year. They are funded with tuition revenue, state taxes and local property taxes.\\nThere\\'s been little, if any, research on community college president contracts and compensation, according to Jim Finkelstein and Judith Wilde of George Mason University.\\nThat\\'s not the case for four-year universities. Together, Finkelstein and Wilde have collected more than 300 contracts from four-year institutions over the past 15 years. Among their research findings:\\nPerformance bonuses have appeared in an increasing number of contracts over the past 20 years, though recently some institutions are moving away from them and increasing base salaries instead.\\nIn nearly all contracts the researchers obtained, there was little definition of what the president needs to do to receive a performance bonus. Arizona was an anomaly, with a legislative committee outlining specific metrics the state\\'s three public university leaders must meet to earn their bonuses. One president lost out on a portion of their bonus because they had increased enrollment by 9.9%, not the mandated 10%.\\nA bonus equivalent to 15% of a leader\\'s base pay — as the UW chancellors can earn this year — is not excessive compared to other institutions.\\n\"It\\'s actually a bit below what we normally see; 20% is probably the most common amount, but we\\'ve seen as high as 50%,\" Finkelstein said.\\nContact Kelly Meyerhofer at kmeyerhofer@gannett.com or 414-223-5168.

As the sun nears the height of its 11-year cycle in 2025, people across the world can expect more frequent and brighter northern-light activity due to increased electromagnetic activity.\\nWhere can I see the northern lights in Wisconsin?\\nAccording to the NOAA, the northern lights could be visible in northern Wisconsin and perhaps as far south as southern Wisconsin and northern Illinois Thursday night and into the weekend.\\nThe northern lights are expected to be visible in multiple northern U.S. states Thursday night, Friday night and Saturday night, according to the Space Weather Prediction Center.\\nSightings are forecasted along the U.S.-Canada border, but also as far south as Oregon to Pennsylvania, according to the center. The best time to view the auroras will be Friday from around midnight into the early hours of Saturday.\\nOutside variables, such as weather and the precise trajectory of the solar eruption, which can change during its 93-million-mile journey to Earth, could affect the reliability of the forecast.\\nTo monitor the aurora forecast, you can use the NOAA aurora forecast tool, which has a 30-minute forecast window. There's also a tool on the Milwaukee Astronomical Society website at milwaukeeastro.org.\\nOn the tool, you'll see the northern lights prediction for 35 minutes ahead. You'll have good odds of seeing the northern lights if the color over Wisconsin is yellow, orange or even red.\\nWhat causes the northern lights?\\nAlso known as aurora borealis, the northern lights are a natural light display in Earth's sky that is famously best seen in high-latitude regions of the northern and southern hemispheres.\\nThe phenomenon is caused when electrically charged particles from space enter Earth's atmosphere and collide with molecules and gasses like oxygen and nitrogen, causing the atmospheric particles to gain energy. To return to their normal state, the particles release that energy in the form of light, according to the University of Alaska at Fairbanks, Geophysical Institute website, which tracks the phenomenon.\\nAs auroras form, Earth's magnetic field redirects the particles toward the poles through a process that produces a stunning display of rays, spirals and flickers that have fascinated humans for millennia. Whether hues of green, red, blue and pink dance about in the sky is due to the altitude in which the collisions occur, as well as the composition and density of the atmosphere at the time.\\nWhen northern lights are active, the best time to see them is between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m.\\nBest places in Wisconsin to see the northern lights\\nHere's a list of places in Wisconsin that could offer some of the best views of the night sky:\\nJournal Sentinel reporter Alex Groth contributed to this report.\",\n",

Polka?\\'\\' Cyr said. \\'He kept joking he was going to make a song about it.\\'\\nThen last year he really did.\\nA writer and occasional musician, Jachym worked all kinds of Wisconsin goodies into the lyrics — deer hunting, ice fishing, tailgates, curds, brats, booyah, frozen custard, Pabst Blue Ribbon — all while making it an ode to his wife. He called it \\'Green Bay Baby.\\'\\nMy Green Bay baby, she don\\'t mind the cold\\nMy Green Bay baby, looks great in green and gold\\nI know she loves her Packers and I know she loves me\\nThat\\'s my Green Bay baby\\nWith the exception of a bubbler mention, Jachym managed to get all the iconic things on his list into the song. Cyr offered only a tweak here or there to make sure it was Wisconsin-proof. For the deer hunting reference, for example, she specifically requested he use the word \\'bags\\' in reference to a 10-point buck.\\n\\'Everybody makes fun of me for how I say bag, because it\\'s very Midwest,\\' said Cyr, who has lived in Connecticut for the last six years. \\'They\\'re like, \\'You\\'re saying beg, like I beg you. No, I\\'m saying bag.\\'\\'\\nOnce the lyrics were done, Jachym handed them over to his wife so she could work her magic. A Pulaski High School graduate who studied at the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay and then transferred to the Berklee College of Music in Boston, she\\'s a professional jazz vocalist, trumpet player and composer. She has toured extensively with five-time Grammy Award-winning jazz bassist and vocalist Esperanza Spalding and released her debut album, \\'First Instinct,\\' in 2019. She\\'s performed on \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" and \"Austin City Limits.\"\\nIn other words, she\\'s no rookie.\\n\\'Immediately the melody just came to me,\\' she said of writing the music for \\'Green Bay Baby.\\' \\'I knew it had to be a polka, because of the state dance. It was very quick.\\'\\nThe next part was a little trickier. How were two people living in Connecticut, neither of whom play polka music, going to record it? They needed a singer with a strong Wisconsin accent. (Spoiler alert: This is the part of the story where being from a place that celebrates Pulaski Polka Days with 32,000 people comes in handy.)\\n\\'Of course I was like, \\'Well, I\\'m from Pulaski, Wisconsin. I know plenty of polka musicians. I went to school with polka musicians,\\'\\' Cyr said.\\nShe immediately thought of The New Generation and contacted vocalist Jeff Maroszek to see if the popular local polka band might be game. They were in; she sent them the music.\\n\\'They\\'re very old-school, so they had to learn it in a new key all by ear, because they don\\'t really read music, which I thought was super impressive,\\' Cyr said.\\nShe came back to Wisconsin last November for the recording session at Rock Garden Studio in Appleton. She convinced her dad, who was born, raised and still lives in Green Bay and has the authentic accent to prove it, to do the dialogue with Maroszek that opens the song and pops up again in the middle. The New Generation musicians brought their kids to the studio. That\\'s them lending their voices on the \\'Go Pack Go\\' parts.\\nCyr asked Christina Skalecki, who she remembered as being good at art in high school, to draw the \\'Green Bay Baby\\' cover art.\\nMore: Sam Brooker\\'s heartfelt anthem to his hometown is filled with Packers pride and a hook big enough to fill Lambeau\\nMore: Packers fan\\'s 1972 green and gold Cadillac, a Lambeau Field tailgating fixture since 1990, destroyed by fire\\nAll of those little touches were especially important to Cyr\\'s vision for making the project \\'super homegrown.\\' When it came time to make the video, she wanted to feature real Green Bay folks and people she knew, so she put out a call on social media for friends and family to send photos and clips of them doing the Wisconsin things mentioned in the song.\\nShe also spent three days driving around Green Bay last year while in town for a Packers game to get additional footage of local landmarks and Packers fans. The actual babies in the video in infant Packers gear are her son, daughter and niece.\\nEspecially sentimental to her is footage that Jachym was able to extract from an old home movie her grandparents made in 1987. The scenes of the Tower Drive Bridge (now the Leo Frigo Memorial Bridge) and Bay Beach Amusement Park were taken from that, as was the closing footage of her grandfather opening his car door as the camera zooms in on a pre-renovation Lambeau Field in the background.\\n\\'Every time I watch it, I almost start crying, because it\\'s my grandfather who passed and he\\'s opening the door to the stadium,\\' Cyr said.\\n\\'Green Bay Baby\\' made its debut in July when The New Generation performed it at Pulaski Polka Days. Cyr has been trying to spread the word since that it\\'s available on Spotify and other streaming platforms.\\nWhen she took her 6-year-old son, Dean, to his first Packers game for the home opener against the Indianapolis Colts in September, she spent time passing out QR codes for the polka to tailgaters. She has made sure all of her musician friends who play in tailgate bands have the music.\\nPackers fans will be able to hear The New Generation play it live (numerous times) during a pregame party from 9 a.m. to noon Oct. 13 at The Bar on Holmgren Way ahead of the game against the Arizona Cardinals.\\nIt has been a fun project for the couple who lives in New England Patriots territory and has three Packers flags and one of those wooden Packers players on a swing hanging in their yard.\\n\\'I don\\'t know where this is going to go. Maybe it\\'ll be played at all the bars around the stadium. Maybe everyone is going to play it at their tailgate. I would love that. Maybe the Packers will play it. I don\\'t know,\\' Cyr said.\\n\\'But you know what, everybody around my hometown and Green Bay, if they hear it, they\\'re going to love it and they\\'re going to enjoy it. And that\\'s why we did it.\\'',\n",

       "   'excerpt': 'The poll release comes in the middle of a busy campaign week in Wisconsin, with both Harris and Trump planning rallies in the next four days.',\n",
       "   'summary': 'Vice President Kamala Harris maintains a four-point lead over President Donald Trump in Wisconsin, according to the latest Marquette University Law School poll released Wednesday.\\nAmong both registered and likely voters, it was 52% for Harris and 48% for Trump. That shows no change from the last poll, released in mid-September, which had the same numbers for both registered and likely voters.\\n\"It was a little bit tighter than that in July, after Harris first got in the race, where Trump led by 1% with registered (voters) but Harris led by 1% with likely voters,\" poll director Charles Franklin said. \"But this four-point margin ... holds up again this time.\"\\nThe poll surveyed 882 registered voters, 798 of which are considered likely to vote, between Sept. 18 and 26. Respondents are considered likely voters based on their voting record since 2016. The margin of error for both likely and registered voters was plus or minus 4.4 percentage points.\\nThe poll release comes in the middle of a busy week for both campaigns in Wisconsin. Trump held two events in Milwaukee and Dane County yesterday, while second gentleman Doug Emhoff campaigned in Milwaukee at the same time. Harris is set to hold a rally in the Fox Valley Thursday, and Trump will return Sunday for a rally in Juneau.\\nFranklin said one more Marquette poll of Wisconsin voters will be released on Oct. 30, less than a week before Election Day on Nov. 5. Other polls in Wisconsin have found a tighter race with about a one or two point margin, he noted.\\n\"Remember — not that I really want to remind you — but we were off by four points last time in 2020. We were off by over six in 2016,\" Franklin said. \"So fair warning, these results could change. We could be wrong, on the other hand, we could be right.\"\\nWhen factoring in third-party candidates like Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., Jill Stein and Cornel West, Harris still has a four-point lead over Trump, 48% to 44% among registered voters.\\nKennedy sued to remove his name from the ballot after dropping out of the race, a process he repeated in other battleground states over concerns that he would pull votes away from Trump. The state Supreme Court kept him on the ballot.\\nMail-in absentee voting is underway in Wisconsin with Kennedy\\'s name on the ballot. In the last Marquette poll, only 14% of voters were not aware that Kennedy had exited the race.\\nSupport for Kennedy among Wisconsin voters has declined significantly over the past months, down to 3% in the new poll. Support for other third-party candidates has also dropped, now polling one percent or less. Earlier in the year, third-party candidates together were polling at about 24%.\\n\"Put that together, it\\'s a total of 6% voting third-party right now. The high this century is 5.5% of the actual vote in 2016,\" Franklin said. \"So right now, the independent vote is just a smidgen higher than that actual vote was then.\"\\nFranklin has said that about a third of Kennedy voters would go to Harris, while two-thirds would vote for Trump. Some voters may still vote for Kennedy as a protest vote.\\nMore:How could keeping RFK Jr\\'s name on the Wisconsin ballot impact on 2024 presidential results?\\nWhen President Joe Biden was still in the presidential race, Republicans had a large advantage in voter enthusiasm. In the first poll to include Harris as the candidate, she closed the enthusiasm gap, but Trump still had a slight edge. In the September poll, she pulled ahead: Respondents \"very\" enthusiastic to vote broke for Harris 53% and for Trump 47%.\\nIn the new poll, Harris keeps an edge over Trump in voter enthusiasm, but Republicans have inched up in enthusiasm while Democrats had a slight dip. Among Democrats, 71% said they are \"very\" enthusiastic to vote, down one point from September, and 67% of Republicans said the same, up four points from the last poll.\\n\"We\\'re really not seeing huge differences with enthusiasm, maybe slightly more of a Democratic advantage with the enthused,\" Franklin said. \"But it\\'s not nearly the chasm that we saw with Biden, or the early, sharp differences we saw with Harris as the candidate.\"',\n",

       "   'summary': 'MADISON — Republican former President Donald Trump will return to Wisconsin on Sunday for a rally at the Dodge County Airport in Juneau — a fourth campaign event in the battleground state in nine days, his campaign announced Wednesday.\\nThe rally follows events on Tuesday in Dane and Milwaukee counties — the state\\'s two Democratic strongholds. Trump led in Dodge County by about 15,000 votes, or 31 percentage points, in 2020 when he lost the state to Demcoratic President Joe Biden by about 21,000 votes.\\nHe campaigned in Prairie du Chien in southwestern Wisconsin on Saturday. His Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, has a Thursday campaign stop in the Fox Cities region. Further details have not been announced. Harris held a rally in Madison on Sept. 20.\\nLike his Tuesday visit to Waunakee, Trump\\'s remarks in Juneau are being framed by the campaign as a critique of the current Democratic administration\\'s economic policy.\\n\"This November, Wisconsin voters will send a clear message at the ballot box when they reject the dangerous Democrat, Kamala Harris. Wisconsin voters know that only President Trump can Make America Affordable Again,\" the campaign said in a news release.\\nDuring his remarks at the metal fabrication facility Dane Manufacturing, the former president spoke for more than 30 minutes before touching on economic issues — aside from a brief tangent during which he said he wouldn\\'t trust Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris or President Joe Biden \"to run a lemonade stand.\"\\nA Marquette University Law School poll released last month showed that the economy was the top issue for Wisconsin voters, with 41% ranking it as their first priority. The same poll found that to be true among 42% of independent voters.\\nIn Waunakee, Trump pledged to cut taxes on American manufacturers to 15%, \"but only if you make the product here.\" Otherwise, he said, \"we\\'re going to use the power of the tariff.\" He also pledged, if elected, to bring energy prices in the U.S. down by 50% within a year of taking office, declaring the country has \"liquid gold\" by way of \"more oil and gas under our feet than anybody else.\"\\nHe later took questions from reporters for about 45 minutes in Milwaukee after giving remarks that were similar to the points he made in Waunakee.\\nWhile speaking at Discovery World in Milwaukee, Trump hinted his team was looking at holding a rally at Fiserv Forum, which hosted the Republican National Convention in July. Harris also held a rally at the home of the Milwaukee Bucks during the Democratic National Convention.\\n\"The building was beautiful,\" Trump said. \"I love Milwaukee. We had such a great convention here. They treated us so well. I also like the result. If I didn\\'t get the right result, I probably wouldn\\'t like Milwaukee. I got a great result.\"\\nTrump added he\\'ll announce a rally in Green Bay soon, potentially the day before a Green Bay Packers game. He also hinted at a third event that would be similar to the press conference format of the Tuesday night event in Milwaukee, which was ultimately closed to the public.\\nHope Karnopp of the Journal Sentinel contributed.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'Tuesday night\\'s vice-presidential debate featured a brief moment of shared empathy between the candidates when Gov. Tim Walz recounted a time when his teenage son witnessed a shooting.\\nWhile answering a question about gun violence, Walz, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, said his 17-year-old son witnessed a shooting at a community center while he was there playing volleyball.\\n\\'Those things don\\'t leave you,\" Walz said Tuesday on the debate stage.\\nThe admission left Walz\\'s Republican opponent JD Vance shaking his head in sadness, muttering, \"that\\'s awful.\"\\nVice-presidential debate: Where do Vance, Walz stand on gun control? Differing visions emerge at VP debate.\\nThe personal moment came while Walz and Vance were being questioned about gun violence, particularly school shootings.\\nThe Harris campaign told both the Washington Post and New York Times that Walz was referring to a shooting that happened in January 2023 at the Jimmy Lee Recreation Center in Saint Paul.\\nUSA TODAY has reached out to the Harris campaign and a representative for Walz for more information.\\nAccording to Minnesota Public Radio, which covered the attack, a 26-year-old employee at the center shot a teenager during a fight. The center is across the street from Central High School in St. Paul, where Gus Walz is a student.\\nThough the 16-year-old victim survived, he had to have a portion of his skull removed and still suffers from seizures, MPR reported.\\nAfter sharing about his son, Walz continued, \\'as a member of Congress, I sat in my office surrounded by dozens of the Sandy Hook parents, and they were looking at my 7-year-old\\'s picture on the wall. Their 7-year-olds were dead, and they were asking us to do something.\\'\\nWalz\\'s disclosure appeared to elicit sympathy from Sen. Vance (R-Ohio,) who called gun violence a \\'terrible epidemic\\' during the debate.\\n\\'Tim, first of all, I didn\\'t know that your 17-year-old witnessed a shooting, and I\\'m sorry about that,\\' Vance said after Walz was done speaking.\\n\\'Christ have mercy,\" he continued, \"it is awful.\\'\\n\\'I appreciate it,\\' Walz responded.\\nWhile the candidates on both tickets have said they are gun owners, Vance and Walz largely disagree on how best to curb the epidemic of gun violence in the United States – the leading cause of death among children and teens.\\nVance, who opposes most gun control legislation, focused on improving security around the schools and blamed gun violence on immigration issues at the border.\\n\"I unfortunately think that we have to increase security in our schools,\" Vance said. \"We have to make the doors lock better. We have to make the doors stronger. We\\'ve got to make the windows stronger, and of course, we\\'ve got to increase school resource officers.\"\\nWalz, meanwhile, focused on gun control legislation and touted his record in Minnesota passing enhanced background checks while selling firearms.\\n\"We understand that the Second Amendment is there, but our first responsibility is to our kids to figure this out,\" he said.\\nAmid the policy differences, Walz did take a moment to note that he and Vance, both fathers, were in agreement that shootings were \\'abhorrent.\\'\\n\\'I do think that this is a good start to the conversation,\\' Walz said.\\nContributing: Kinsey Crowley, USA TODAY',\n",

       "   'excerpt': 'From Giannis and Dame to playing the young guys: Five pressing questions for the Bucks as they enter the 2024-25 season.',\n",
       "   'summary': \"The Milwaukee Bucks will open the 2024-25 NBA season as a legitimate championship contender for the seventh straight season, a run that does include the 2021 title. But, it has been fraught with disappointment as well, including back-to-back first-round exits the last two years.\\nWith Doc Rivers holding his first training camp as Bucks head coach and all-star point guard Damian Lillard having an entire season (and offseason) under his belt, there is belief this team is ready to make its deepest playoff run since that championship summer.\\nHere are some of the pressing questions the team must answer if it intends to unseat the defending champion Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference:\\nOne could argue getting the most out of a Hall of Fame big man and Hall of Fame point guard was the sole reason the Bucks turned to Rivers, one of the most successful coaches in NBA history. Adrian Griffin was fired after 43 games and Rivers immediately went to work on getting the two stars more comfortable with one another.\\nAnd, over the final part of the season, the Bucks saw flashes of the potential. But lack of practice time and injury limited what could be done. Now, as the two players had a season of play together, a summer to communicate and a full camp under Rivers, the expectation is the pair will hit the ground running.\\nNow, it's not all on Rivers. Antetokounmpo will have to commit more to screening fully, making a move off a bounce pass (and perhaps higher up in the halfcourt) and improve his skills in a short roll. Lillard will need to help get Antetokounmpo closer to his preferred spots and find a rhythm with lob passes. But Rivers can manipulate the minutes and lineups to best suit the pair and get them clicking.\\nEvery summer the Bucks have been in position to compete largely because its 'Core Four' of Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton, Brook Lopez and point guards Jrue Holiday and Lillard were in place. Bobby Portis has emerged as a regular Sixth Man of the Year candidate and Pat Connaughton has remained a solid backup. But beyond that, injuries to some of those stars the last three seasons have exposed flaws in roster construction – particularly the reliance on aging veterans in free agency.\\nOf the dozen veterans aged 31 and older signed since 2021, only two (Wesley Matthews, Joe Ingles) received another full-year NBA contract after playing for the Bucks to date. And 'younger' veterans the team signed like Rodney Hood, Semi Ojeleye and DeAndre' Bembry never played in the league after signing with the Bucks.\\nThe best free agent acquisitions since 2021 have been Jevon Carter and Malik Beasley, who turned in career seasons and signed elsewhere.\\nOn paper, the signings of starting shooting guard Gary Trent Jr., defensive-minded guard Delon Wright and versatile forward Taurean Prince is Horst's best offseason since signing Portis, Bryn Forbes, Torrey Craig and D.J. Augustin in 2020.\\nOf course, time will tell how the new trio fits into Rivers' rotations, but in order for the Bucks to get back to a conference finals they need to play well.\\nThis is a yes or no question that can only be answered when the season ends, but unfortunately it the most important question facing this team.\\nSince winning the title (a run which saw the team lose starting shooting guard Donte DiVincenzo in the playoffs and Antetokounmpo for two games of the Eastern Conference finals), the team's stars have been beset by injury:\\n2021-22: Brook Lopez missed 69 regular-season games after back surgery. Though he returned for the playoffs, it was clear the rust wasn't all the way off (21% from behind three-point line, 49% shooting). Middleton slipped on a wet spot in the first round and sprained a knee, knocking him out of the second-round series vs. Boston.\\n2022-23: Antetokounmpo was undercut by Miami's Kevin Love and injured his back, forcing him to miss nearly all of Game 1, all of Games 2 and 3, and was clearly limited in Games 4 and 5. Middleton played all five games, but was hobbled enough that he needed knee surgery after the season. Wesley Matthews also missed three games with a calf injury.\\n2023-24: Antetokounmpo missed all six games vs. Indiana with a calf strain, Lillard missed two games and was hampered in Game 6 with a strained Achilles. And while Middleton had a great series, he needed double ankle surgeries following the playoffs after stepping on opponent's feet.\\nWhile some of those injuries were freakish, some were soft tissue or 'wear-and-tear' related. Can those be prevented? It's hard to say. Lillard insisted to the Journal Sentinel his physical issues stemmed from a summer where he didn't train while waiting for a trade, and Antetokounmpo said he'd re-evaluate his offseason regimen. Middleton rehabbed again from surgeries.\\nIt would make sense that Rivers and the Bucks training staff try to place some governors on the minutes of the 'Core Four,' but at the end of last season Antetokounmpo was skeptical that sitting out a random game in the winter could keep him healthy in the spring. How the team best manages the in-season bumps and bruises and workload will be something to watch.\\nThe Celtics deserve this respect after putting together one of the more dominant wire-to-wire seasons in NBA history. This isn't to discount the other playoff teams, but let's stick with the champs.\\nThe short answer is, 'yes.'\\nThe Bucks matchup very well with Boston, even though it's fair (and correct) to note the Celtics' star duo of Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum are younger than the Bucks' stars.\\nFirst, and most simply, the Celtics have no answer for Antetokounmpo. In fact, the last time we saw Antetokounmpo healthy in a playoff he turned in one of the greatest postseason performances of all time in 2022 – and that was when Boston had Marcus Smart, Grant Williams and Robert Williams to go with Al Horford in slowing him down. Provided Antetokounmpo is at full capacity, the Celtics will have nothing for him.\\nMilwaukee must figure out how to decrease the effectiveness of Tatum and Brown without a premier individual wing defender, but on paper it feels like the additions of Trent Jr., Wright and Prince can provide a better defense to those two Celtics stars.\\nOn a broader level the math says the Celtics will not repeat as there has not been a repeat champion since 2017-18. Drilling down into Boston specifically, Tatum, Holiday and Derrick White all joined Team USA for an Olympic run after the season. Kristaps Porziņģis had foot surgery in late June and will miss a significant start to the year. Al Horford is 38 years old. The Celtics will likely be very good again, but they also have an uphill climb to a repeat chance – not including having to hurdle the Bucks.\\nThis is a favorite topic of Bucks fans – and honestly, fans in Rivers' previous stops as a head coach. But let's stick to this team for this year. AJ Green became a rotation player under Rivers, playing about 15 minutes per game at the end of the season. Andre Jackson Jr. played less under Rivers than he did under Griffin, but the guard has some defensive and playmaking ability (and athleticism) the team could use in spots.\\nMarJon Beauchamp is entering his third year so one might think he's in position to earn more significant time. Chris Livingston told the Journal Sentinel he hopes to earn a few more minutes this season in his second year but understands that on a veteran team those chances will be limited. Rookies AJ Johnson and Tyler Smith are clearly developmental players at this juncture.\\nSimply, this is a veteran team. The top nine players are set to start the season. Three of them (Trent Jr., Wright, Prince) are new and need time and reps to work in with the six returning core players. In the playoffs, the rotation will be nine at most, perhaps eight.\\nSo frankly, there isn't room for the 'young guys' in that way.\\nThat said, over 82 regular-season games, injuries and minute management will open the door for more time for Green, Jackson Jr. and perhaps Beauchamp and Livingston to round out the 48 minutes of action.\",\n",

       "   'summary': 'Green Bay lost the game, traffic in São Paulo was awful, and overall, Packers fans had a great time in Brazil. Not unlike the game in London in 2022, which could make the same claims.\\n\"We had a great time in Brazil. It was fun seeing a totally different culture than ours,\" said Linda Anderson of Sun Prairie. \"The game experience was lots of fun. The Brazilian fans were very excited to have an NFL game.\"\\nThe turnout was not as great as for London, which tour company president Dennis Garrity of Event USA in Ashwaubenon attributed to negative publicity beforehand. Event USA\\'s group included more than 300 people, compared with 800 for London, but fans who did travel to Brazil said they enjoyed the experience.\\n\"The fans and the togetherness; everybody was so hospitable,\" said Justin Sterna. \"It was nice to take in their culture, before, after and during the game.\"\\nSterna hails from Wisconsin, calls Colorado home at the moment, but travels so much it\\'s hard to pin him to a place. He has, for example, attended 118 consecutive Packers games, visited 28 of the NFL\\'s 30 stadiums, and will hit No. 29 this week in Los Angeles. He went to London in 2022 and saw São Paulo as just another stop, albeit a distant one.\\nMike Niedfeldt of Stoughton flew to Rio de Janeiro first, and he and friend Stacey Juno of Monroe found themselves in the midst of other Packers fans, including four groups on his plane. He used a Google translate app on his phone to communicate with Brazilians, who speak Portuguese. They spent quite a bit of time at the beach, which Rio has and São Paulo does not.\\n\"An interesting thing about the beach in Rio is, once you are there and settled in your place, you will be able to eat just about anything, brought right up to you,\" he said. \"They will bring you sweet corn, seafood, grilled meat, a variety of alcohol drinks, along with swimsuits, T-shirts and more.\"\\nAnderson said they liked Rio better than São Paulo. They stayed at a resort on the beach and visited other sites in Rio, including the Christ the Redeemer statue, which is on a mountain 2,000-plus feet above the city and Tijuca National Park.\\n\"The absolute worst part of the trip was the terrible traffic in São Paulo. It took over two hours to get the stadium that was only about 12 miles away,\" Anderson said.\\nNiedfeldt agreed. They found themselves going less far afield in São Paulo because of the location of their hotel and traffic issues.\\n\"Traffic was insane, with all the people, and half the cars were either taxis or Uber. Motorcycles were zipping in and out of traffic most anywhere. It would have been a nightmare to attempt to drive. We found Rio de Janeiro to be a much nicer city than São Paulo,\" he said.\\nThe Andersons were part of Event USA\\'s tour group, so didn\\'t have to sweat the trip\\'s details, but Sterna, who in the course of his consecutive-games streak, turned testing fate into an art form.\\n\"You just let it roll off your back,\" he said. \"Since I\\'ve done it so long, it\\'s just conditioning. It\\'s a process for sure,\" he said.\\nHe and friend Brad Belmer, who works for an airline, arrived in São Paulo the morning of the game, found an $80 hotel room about a 15-minute walk from the stadium, and then set about getting tickets. \"At one point (in the weeks before the game) tickets were $800. I said, \\'that\\'s a little much,\\'\" Sterna said. \"We waited and we paid about $300 each.\"\\nThey had time to explore both before and after the game, and along the way met a pair of Virginians who\\'d live in Brazil for 20 years. The new friends offered suggestions of where to go and what to do, including visiting a site outside of São Paulo with parks, good food and cheap beer.\\n\"The prices, oh my gosh! The beer was $4. Even the food was super cheap,\" Sterna said.\\nEveryone remarked on the favorable currency exchange rate in Brazil. A train ride was 90 cents, taxis and Ubers a couple of dollars, hotel rooms for as little as $80 and food a quarter or less than it would cost in the United States.\\nIn the months before the game, rumors abounded about the danger of gangs, about how fans could not safely wear green in Neo QuÍmica Arena because it was the color worn by the local soccer club\\'s arch rivals and the prevalence of tropical diseases. In the final telling, none of that proved to be an issue.\\nIn fact, when Niedfeldt and Juno were walking around, a Brazilian named Roland noticed Juno\\'s Packers hat and struck up a conversation. He had lived in the United States briefly and his children still do, and so they made a new friend.\\nNiedfeldt and Juno took the light rail train from their hotel to the stadium. It took about 20 minutes, while friends who were about a 40-minute drive from their hotel (without traffic) took two hours to get to the stadium by bus, about the same time it took the Packers from their hotel.\\nThey came to a tailgate area between the train station and the stadium, spent some time there, then walked the additional 20 minutes to the arena.\\n\"They have a pretty good transit system. It was only 90 cents U.S.,\" Sterna said. \"It was kind of nice taking the train to the stadium stop. In my mind, you got the authentic experience.\"\\nLike Niedfeldt, Sterna stopped by the Jordy Nelson-hosted tailgate party on the way to the game and he ran into friends from the state he did not know were at the game.\\n\"It amazed me how many people were from Wisconsin, and even Green Bay,\" he said.\\nIt was odd to have the game start at 9:15 p.m. São Paulo time, but the stadium got high marks.\\n\"Tottenham (in London) definitely felt like an NFL stadium to me. São Paulo, I had the same feels, but how it\\'s designed, you could tell it\\'s more of a soccer stadium,\" Sterna said of Neo Química Arena. \"I\\'d love to see a soccer game there.\"\\nHe said security at the game was plentiful, with a large contingent of police.\"They did a great job. There was only really one way into the stadium. From an executional standpoint, they did well. I would give it a nine,\" Sterna said.\\nGarrity said his group had no issues with security. \"Everything went impeccably well,\" he said.\\nSterna returned to the United States the same way he got to Brazil.\\n\"I\\'m very fly-by-the-seat-of-my-pants,\" he said. \"Even getting back, we could have been stuck for days. Brad and I got the last two seats to Chicago.\"\\nIt took as much time going to and returning from São Paulo as they spent on the ground in Brazil, about 36 hours.\\nHe was not burdened with souvenirs. \"I\\'d rather collect memories than objects\" he said.\\nHe\\'s also looking forward to the next international game. The Packers were the last NFL team to play a regular-season international game when they went to London to play the New York Giants in 2022. The addition of a 17th game to the NFL schedule in 2022 guarantees each team will play every four years and most more often than that.\\n\"I feel like now that we\\'ve had two international games, I\\'m kind of excited about where that next game is going to be,\" Sterna said.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'There has been a Sasquatch sighting on Manistique Avenue in South Milwaukee.\\nThis sighting was not in the woods but in the wood ― specifically carved into a large log.\\nJoel Asplin, a South Milwaukee resident, is a chainsaw carver and he\\'s been tasked with recreating South Milwaukee Sam, the city\\'s mascot. He is creating the carving in front of his home.\\n\\'I would like people to come by and see the progress,\\' he said.\\nAsplin founded Chisel Point Enterprises in December 2019 soon after he picked up a chainsaw and took it to a dead tree on his property.\\n\\'I don\\'t know what gave me that idea, but my wife and I thought it\\'d be fun,\\' he said. \\'I liked it so much I thought this is a business endeavor I should do.\\'\\nSam should be completed sometime in October, Asplin said. He\\'s also working on some other projects, including carving a log for a neighbor who just cut down a tree as well as working with a client in Nebraska where he used to live and attend church.\\nFaith is a big part of Asplin\\'s life and comes through in his work. His website motto is: \\'God carves me, and I carve logs.\\'\\nHis business name, Chisel Point Enterprises, is based on the concept of how God \\'chisels us, shapes us and forms us into better people, people who are connected with him, people that have victory over sin (and) have power they can access.\\' The \"Enterprises\" portion is because Asplin hopes to expand into other artistic enterprises including T-shirt design, paintings and prints.\\nAsplin said his goal is to have the beauty of God shine through him and his work.\\n\\'When God carves us and works on us, we become stronger and better; we become more beautiful,\\' he said.\\nAsplin said he spoke with Mayor Jim Shelenske in 2023 about possibly doing a carving event during a city function. He said he\\'d be willing to do the event for free as long as he could sell his work.\\nIt was earlier this year that Asplin got a call from Shelenske asking if he\\'d want to carve South Milwaukee Sam, the city\\'s new mascot. Asplin said he\\'d donate a portion of the price and the city agreed to pay the remainder through part of a Bucyrus Foundation grant.\\n\\'I do like how Sam is promoting businesses in South Milwaukee. I think that\\'s important,\\' Asplin said, adding Sam posed for pictures which were used in designing the carving.\\nCity documents indicate the carving will be about 6 feet tall and over 28 inches in diameter. Asplin estimated the project would take him 36 hours to complete, according to his Aug. 6 project quote submitted to the city.\\nThe carving itself cost $5,400, but Asplin is donating $4,400 of the project cost to the city. In total, with tax, the complete cost to the city to be paid through grant money came to $1,318.60.\\nCity Administrator Patrick Brever said the Common Council unanimously approved the project. He said the carving will be placed under the pavilion at Bucyrus Commons ― near the bronze Reggie \"Da Crusher\" Lisowski statue.\\nAsplin has carved many things, including crosses, a bear, a golfer, a chair with footstool and a soaring eagle, to name a few.\\nOne of his favorite creations is a snail with a few flowers and mushrooms for a woman in West Allis. He made them out of three maple tree stumps on her property.\\n\\'She just loved it,\\' Asplin said, and sent him a photo and text message in appreciation: \\'Hi Joel! I\\'m enjoying your work of art every day. Wanted to show you the beautiful fungus that grew on it last fall. Can\\'t wait to see what nature does this fall! I heard you did a sculpture for my neighbor. I hope you walked down here to see your work while you were in the neighborhood. Hope you have a great school year!\\'\\nAsplin works as a high school history teacher for Cross Trainers Academy through the Milwaukee Rescue Mission. He said he likes teaching and has no plans to leave the profession to carve full-time.\\n\\'I really appreciate where God has me right now, it\\'s a good place,\\' he said. \\'I feel like I can make an impact with helping young adults in an underprivileged area to learn more about themselves and about God and how they can be upstanding members of the community.\\'\\nHe hopes his business might also inspire some of his students to be entrepreneurs.\\nHe said it was an art history class he was not enjoying that led him to switch to more general history and become a teacher.\\n\\'I don\\'t want to have to follow all these other artists, learn about all these techniques, I just wanted to draw and paint,\\' Asplin said.\\nThe history aspect of art was boring to him, which he acknowledges is an irony considering his current line of work. He said his dad often mentioned history when talking about modern issues and that\\'s where his personal interest in history came from.\\nHis dad also often used chainsaws which Asplin said always fascinated him.\\n\\'I liked them,\\' he said, saying he never owned one until he started his carving work five years ago.\\nNow he\\'s liking the divide between his history teaching job and his passion for art.\\nPart of what didn\\'t interest him in art history is he likes to do things his own way. He taught himself some techniques and adapted others from YouTube tutorials to create his own style.\\n\"I don\\'t want to copy someone else\\'s artwork,\\' he said. \\'I\\'ve always been someone who wants to do something a little different than the normal.\\'\\nHe gets logs from many sources, including Facebook Marketplace and Ross Landcare in Caledonia. He said the owner there recently cleared some land of trees for expansion.\\nFor those wanting to try their hand at chainsaw carving, Asplin said simply to \\'start safely.\\' He also said it\\'s important to \\'have a philosophy of art and why you\\'re creating art.\\'\\nAsplin started with a Stihl 170, which he said is lightweight but is made by a quality company.\\nHe is also willing to teach people chainsaw carving with an option to sign up on his website, www.chiselpoint.us. Those interested in his work can also contact him at jasplin@chiselpoint.us.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'For Ice Age Trail lovers, it\\'s become a tradition to get out and make tracks on Wisconsin\\'s National Scenic Trail in October.\\nIt\\'s the Mammoth Hike Challenge, and it\\'s a free get-out-there motivational program that started in 2020 at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic to promote tourism and encourage people to get out and be active.\\nThe annual event is organized by the Ice Age Trail Alliance, a nonprofit organization with a mission to conserve, create, maintain and promote the Ice Age Trail.\\nManaged by a partnership between the National Park Service, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and the Ice Age Trail Alliance, the trail is a 1,200-mile long footpath that runs from the west at Interstate State Park in St. Croix Falls to Potowatomi State Park in Sturgeon Bay. It\\'s a twisty route that bisects the state roughly along where the the last glacier terminated more than 12,000 years ago.\\nConceived in the 1950s, the trail is not complete. About 700 miles of route are on a single-track path and the rest is along roads that connect trail segments.\\nIt\\'s simple. People can earn a patch by hiking (or running, backpacking or otherwise travel by foot) 44 miles, and visiting three Ice Age Trail Communities along the way.\\nIf 44 miles is too daunting a distance, participants can replacing hiking miles with \"bonus miles.\" Bonus miles are non-hiking activities that bolster Alliance efforts. Those activities include purchasing Alliance memberships, attending a special challenge event, or hiking a segment with a distinct glacial feature.\\nOnce you\\'ve finished hiking and visiting nearby communities, participants need to fill out an online form. The challenge is done on the honor system.\\nPeople can sign up and fill out the completion from links at the Ice Age Alliance\\'s website: iceagetrail.org.\\nThe challenge requires participants to visit three Trail Communities. Trail Communities have been identified as towns that supports the Ice Age Trail and its users. The Alliance encourages people to support Trail Community businesses by taking a shopping break, eating at a restaurant or grabbing a drink. Right now there are 24 Trail Communties.\\nThe Ice Age Alliance offers a variety of maps, including ones that highlight peak fall colors, alert hikers to hunting areas and identify geocaches. The group\\'s website includes link to buy and download the FarOut mobile app, which provides detailed information about segments, parking and waypoints along the route. And it has ideas for games and activities designed to entertain children on Ice Age Trail hikes.',\n",

Upon reaching third base, Winker shouted in exuberance toward his own dugout. Then, after turning back toward the field, Winker locked eyes with a member of the Brewers, seemingly Adames, and began to shout at him.\\nAdames had some words of his own to offer back.\\n\"I don\\'t know what was going through his head, but he just started saying some stuff and I just said something back,\" Adames said. \"I think that\\'s the kind of player he is. It is what it is.\\n\"Surprising, that was surprising that he would say some stuff. Like I said, I guess that\\'s part of his personality. It was just a little bit of a surprise to me, but we won\\'t back off.\"\\nPopular MLB content creator Jomboy broke down what he believes the players were saying, with a warning in advance for some foul language:\\n\"If you think I\\'m able to run and talk, you don\\'t know my athletic abilities,\" Winker told Mets reporters after the game. \"Can\\'t do that.\"\\nWhat was said?\\n\"Nothing,\" Winker responded. \"I don\\'t really want to speak on it. I just want to focus on the game tomorrow.\"\\nWinker\\'s time with the Brewers was a bit tumultuous. Upon being traded to Milwaukee from Seattle, there were concerns about his clubhouse presence from his time with the Mariners, but those largely subsided while with the Brewers. But Winker was unable to produce despite being given ample opportunities and then after a lengthy stay on the injured list was placed on the postseason roster for the wild-card series. He pinch-hit twice, once in each of the Brewers\\' losses, and got out both times. He was also booed by the crowd on both occasions.',\n",

Things were dire enough at that point that Milwaukee\\'s bullpen quickly became active.\\nIt was a sequence that was somewhat reminiscent of the way Peralta faltered at the end of the fourth and start of the fifth in his Game 2 start against the Arizona Diamondbacks in last year\\'s wild-card series.\\nPeralta did regain control by finishing up the second and ultimately got through four innings before making way for Joel Payamps.\\nWinker, whose one-year tenure in Milwaukee in 2023 did not go well, was booed lustily by Brewers fans as he made his way to the plate for his first at-bat in the second.\\nHe battled Peralta for eight pitches, ultimately sending a changeup down but out over the plate into the corner in right to score a pair and tie the game.\\nA big moment for Winker, no doubt, and he celebrated it lustily by yelling and gesturing toward the New York dugout. Apparently either something Winker said, or just the optics of Winker\\'s gesticulations, rubbed Willy Adames the wrong way and the Milwaukee shortstop made his feelings known.\\nThe moment ended there, but it was an interesting look at two former teammates now going at it in the heat of battle.\\nYou had a feeling it wouldn\\'t take long for the Brewers\\' prized rookie to make his presence felt.\\nHe singled in his first at-bat in the first inning and scored a run, and then singled again with two on in the fourth to draw the Brewers even at 3-3. In doing so, he became the youngest player at 20 years, 204 days to record multiple hits in his postseason debut.\\nChourio then made what appeared to be a home-run-saving catch when he leaped up and reeled in a drive to the wall in left by Starling Marte to open the fifth.\\nThe play prompted Payamps to pound his fist on his chest, and drew a huge ovation from the crowd.\\nBut one batter later the ball again found Chourio and this time he wasn\\'t so fortunate, as he misread Tyrone Taylor\\'s liner. It landed over his head for a double, kick-starting what would be a game-turning, five-run rally.\\nAaron Ashby deserves all the credit in the world for coming all the way back from the left shoulder surgery he underwent early in 2023 and making the postseason roster.\\nBut Tuesday will be a day he\\'ll want to quickly erase from the memory banks, as he faced five batters in the decisive fifth behind Payamps and didn\\'t retire one.\\nAshby entered with runners on first and second and two outs and the score tied at 4-4 and was greeted by an opposite-field single by Brandon Nimmo that loaded the bases.\\nMark Vientos, up next, singled to right to drive in a pair. The Brewers elected to put the dangerous Pete Alonso on to again load the bases, and JD Martinez came off the bench to bounce a two-run single to right.\\nMarte, the man who opened the inning at the plate, followed by walking and that was it for Ashby as Nick Mears finished up the inning.\\nThe misplay by Chourio opened the door to the big inning.\\nBut if Payamps does one basic thing that\\'s drilled into pitchers\\' heads from the opening day of spring training – cover first base – the Mets might not have dented the scoreboard at all.\\nTaylor was on second and Francisco Lindor on first when José Iglesias hit a sharp grounder to first that Rhys Hoskins left his feet to smother.\\nBut Payamps didn\\'t immediately break for first, with his slight hesitation making all the difference as Iglesias slid head-first into the base safely, with Taylor never slowing down as he scored from second.\\nConsidering how the Brewers\\' defense this year has been such a strength, it was jarring to see a couple of miscues turn the tide so quickly.',\n",

       "   'excerpt': 'Thomas Maulson said animosity toward tribal members in the area is significant, and many avoid using tribal license plates out of fear.',\n",
       "   'summary': 'RHINELANDER - An Oneida County man with a well-known family name in the Northwoods claims he was targeted by a sheriff\\'s deputy because he is Indigenous, following an incident in a Walmart parking lot that left him with a head injury.\\nHe also contends the incident reflects broader hostility toward tribal members in the area.\\nA Sheriff\\'s Department captain said the treatment of Thomas Maulson was well within bounds, and that being a member of the Lac du Flambeau tribe was irrelevant. He said he was disappointed that Maulson raised the issue of targeting and being Indigenous, and said he feared it would foster unnecessary divisiveness.\\nMaulson, 43, of Woodruff, said he was the subject of a road rage incident March 30 in which a driver followed him into a Rhinelander parking lot and challenged him to a fight. The two briefly tussled, but soon made up and the other driver drove away.\\nHowever, an Oneida County sheriff\\'s deputy pulled up, approached the vehicle and asked Maulson for his driver\\'s license and registration. Maulson asked, \\'For what?\\' according to the police report. Oneida County Sheriff\\'s Deputy Will Taege then asked Maulson why he was breathing heavily, according to the report, and Maulson replied, \\'Does it matter?\\'\\nAt that point, Taege said in his report, he realized Maulson was a \\'no\\' person and was not complying, so the deputy pulled Maulson out of his car to arrest him. Maulson repeatedly asked, \"What did I do?\" Taege\\'s dashcam video shows Taege handling Maulson, who is handcuffed, and Maulson falling to the pavement, hitting his head.\\nMaulson\\'s attorney, Maggie Hogan, said Taege did not give Maulson enough time to comply. Maulson and Hogan also argue Taege tripped Maulson while pushing him hard, causing the fall. Moments later, another officer arrived and helped lift Maulson from the ground. In the dashcam video, blood is seen streaming across Maulson\\'s face.\\nCaptain Tyler Young of the Oneida County Sheriff\\'s Department reviewed the incident and said Taege acted appropriately. Young said Taege also had the options of a taser, pepper spray or focused strikes, which he did not use.\\nHe said Taege observed that Maulson was agitated, and Taege was trying to get the situation under control. As for the fall, the sheriff\\'s office contends Maulson\\'s legs were crossed and he tripped himself.\\nMaulson said nothing was ever out of control.\\nHe contends he was targeted by Taege because he is a member of the Lac du Flambeau Ojibwe Nation. He said many residents in the area hold animosity toward the tribe, dating back to the so-called Walleye Wars in the 1980s and early \\'90s, and continuing to this day because of an ongoing dispute over access to non-tribal homes located on the Lac du Flambeau reservation.\\nNotably, the police dispatcher told Taege before the altercation and arrest that he should be looking for Maulson from Flambeau, according to a motion filed by Maulson\\'s attorney. But Taege later said he didn\\'t know Maulson was a tribal member.\\nMaulson shares a name with his uncle, a well-known former tribal president and leader of the tribe during the Walleye Wars. Books have been written about his uncle, and about his actions leading up to a federal court decision that the state wrongfully prohibited Ojibwe members from harvesting fish in the Northwoods outside of the state-designated fishing season. The judge said those rights were guaranteed by treaty.\\nMany non-tribal people in the area protested the decision.\\nYoung acknowledged some isolated incidents of harassment against tribal members harvesting walleye do still occur. But, he said, Taege is too young to remember the controversy. Further, he said the road access issue affects only a small number of people and is essentially a private matter. Maulson\\'s \"actions are what caused him to be on the ground,\\' Young said.\\nMaulson also said he and other tribal members choose not to have or display tribal license plates for fear of being targeted by police outside the reservations. Maulson uses Wisconsin plates.\\nYoung said plates are not a big deal. \\'I feel bad that somebody feels scared to have tribal plates,\\' he said.\\nMaulson was charged with misdemeanor disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. The other driver was caught by Rhinelander police and charged with disorderly conduct.\\nMaulson\\'s wife, Rachel Maulson, said their children, ages 6 and 2 at the time, were traumatized by the incident. She said the older one still has a visceral reaction when he sees police. \\'He was taught to respect authority, so he\\'s confused why they would hurt his loved one,\\' Rachel Maulson said. \\'When a cop drives by he\\'s nervous.\\'\\nMaulson received 13 stitches above his right eye, and said he still has medical issues affecting his vision and orientation.\\nMaulsen said he plans to sue the sheriff\\'s office and the deputy, but his attorney told him to hold off until this case is settled. Hogan said a trial is scheduled for early January.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'On the heels of the controversial Netflix true-crime drama about Erik and Lyle Menendez, Los Angeles prosecutors announced they are reviewing new evidence of alleged sexual abuse brought forth by the brothers\\' attorneys.\\nLos Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón spoke about the ongoing review concerning the 1989 double homicide during a news conference on Thursday.\\n\"I know this is an area of tremendous interest nationally, especially since the Netflix documentary came out,\" Gascón said about the case. \"We\\'re getting a lot of calls.\"\\nThe Menendez brothers\\' attorneys have filed petitions for authorities to not only review new evidence but also consider resentencing them for their crimes based on their level of rehabilitation and overall conduct inside of prison, according to Gascón.\\nProsecutors are standing by the 1996 conviction and outcome of the original trials as Gascón said the brothers were \"clearly the murderers\" of their parents, Jose and Kitty Menendez. What prosecutors are reviewing and determining based on the new evidence is whether or not the findings would have led to the jury coming to a \"different conclusion,\" according to the DA.\\n\"I don\\'t think there is any question in this case that the young men, one was 19 and the other was 21 at the time, murdered their parents,\" Gascón said.\\nCliff Gardner, the brothers\\' attorney, told USA TODAY in an email on Friday that the 35 years his clients served in custody \"is enough.\"\\n\"I believe that anyone who fairly considers the extraordinary evidence excluded from the first trial and the new evidence presented in the habeas petition will conclude beyond any question that the brothers were sexually abused,\" Gardner wrote. \"And with today\\'s understanding of the impact of sexual abuse on children − boys or girls − I believe this evidence shows that manslaughter, not murder, was the appropriate sentence.\"\\nThe new evidence Gascón and his office will review includes a photocopied letter that one of the brothers allegedly sent to another family member about him being the victim of molestation.\\nProsecutors were also given evidence by one of the brothers\\' attorneys alleging that he had been molested by his father, according to Gascón, who added that none of the claims brought forth by the defense have been confirmed. The DA did not specify which brother claimed they were molested.\\n\"We are not, at this point, ready to say that we either believe or do not believe that information,\" the DA said. \"But we\\'re here to tell you because we have a moral and ethical obligation to review what is being presented to us and make a determination.\"\\nIf the brothers are resentenced, then Erik Menendez, 53, and Lyle Menendez, 56, could \"walk out\" of prison after already serving 35 years for their parents\\' murders, Gascón said. The other possibilities include the brothers receiving a lesser sentence and even a new trial, the DA added.\\nBoth brothers were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in 1996.\\nA hearing regarding the new evidence is set for Nov. 29, according to Gascón.\\nLos Angeles prosecutors decided to review the new evidence to recognize further that \"both men and woman can be victims of sexual assault,\" Gascón said.\\n\"Most of the victims are usually young women, but there are men also that are victimized,\" according to the DA.\\nGascón also mentioned the 100-plus allegations made against hip-hop mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, which include accusations of sexual assault against young boys and men.\\n\"We have seen over and over again when both young boys and young girls are molested,\" the DA said.\\nA Change.org petition titled \"Appeal for Menendez Brothers\" has over 365,000 signatures and aims to get a new trial, a reduced sentence, or another equitable remedy for Erik and Lyle Menendez.\\n\"The Menendez trial is a very famous and controversial case but unfortunately also very understanding and important in the perspective of someone whose been sexually abused as a child their self,\" the petition\\'s organizer, Micailla Beachman, wrote on the Change.org page.\\n\"The original trial contained information, evidence and testimonies that caused a mistrial, of which i firmly believe was and is the truth. The second trial removed that defense evidence in ignorance of child sexual abuse statistics & lack of humaneness making all given information useless in the final prosecution.\"\\nThe petition\\'s goal is 500,000 signatures, according to the Change.org page.\\n\"Even if (you\\'re) unfamiliar with their case, do the research if it interests you & if not at least understand everyone deserves a second shot at life, in their situation this would be their first real shot at life in freedom, not only from prison but from their inner fears, their past burdens and present regrets, \"Beachman wrote. \"A change in justice was made for a reason, why not retry the case with the new bill?\\nIn addition to Beachman and the thousands who have signed the petition, Kim Kardashian also called for the brothers\\' release in a personal essay shared exclusively with NBC News.\\n\"We are all products of our experiences. They shape who we were, who we are, and who we will be. Physiologically and psychologically, time changes us, and I doubt anyone would claim to be the same person they were at 18,\" the Skims founder and billionaire beauty mogul wrote. \"Twenty-four family members, including their parents\\' siblings, have released statements fully supporting Lyle and Erik.\"\\nKardashian had recently visited the prison where the Menendez brothers were housed, along with Ryan Murphy\\'s \"Monsters\" star Cooper Koch, who plays Erik in the second season of the Netflix miniseries, Variety reported on Sept. 21.\\n\"Can anyone honestly deny that the justice system would have treated the Menendez sisters more leniently,\" Kardashian said, noting that at the time \"there were virtually no systems in place to support survivors, and public awareness of the trauma of male sexual abuse was minimal, often clouded by preconceived judgments and homophobia.\"',\n",

       "   'summary': 'WASHINGTON – Vice President Kamala Harris during a visit to North Carolina on Saturday met with local officials to receive an update on Hurricane Helene recovery efforts, spoke with several families impacted by the catastrophic storm and helped at a donation center.\\nHarris provided updates on a major disaster declaration that unlocked more funds for affected individuals in the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and 27 counties throughout the state during a briefing with officials, including Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer and Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles.\\nFollowing the briefing, Harris met privately with families impacted by the storm. Helene, a Category 4 hurricane when it made landfall along Florida\\'s Big Bend region on Sept. 26, has killed more than 200 people and left thousands without power or drinkable water.\\nOne family that Harris met with was forced to temporarily relocate from western North Carolina to Charlotte with their six-month-old until they can safely return home, according to the White House. Harris also met with an individual who assisted in lifesaving recovery efforts during flooding in western North Carolina.\\nHarris also met with volunteers at a donation center who explained their efforts to get supplies to communities in the state heavily affected by Helene, including Asheville and Morganton. The vice president also joined a production line where she dropped deodorant and a bar of soap into a plastic, resealable bag.\\n\\'You are the heroes among us,\\' Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, told the volunteers at the donation center. \\'Because I do believe in moments of crisis heroes are revealed who just step up to help people in need and to show that kind of strength that people need to feel in each other.\\'\\nOne volunteer, Angelica Wind, was from Asheville, and brought her daughter and a friend to the donation center to \\'try to get a couple of days of normalcy.\\' Harris asked about Wind\\'s family, to which she said her family just got power back.\\nWind highlighted how a lot of people in her community are still missing, and people are still grieving and hurting.\\n\\'But there\\'s also a lot of resilience,\\' Wind said. \\'There\\'s a lot of resilience. The community\\'s coming together.\\'\\nBefore visiting the donation center, Harris greeted National Guard members while at Charlotte Air National Guard Base who were loading military aircrafts with pallets of emergency aid to be flown to communities throughout western North Carolina.\\n\\'For the folks who are local, I also know what this means for each of you as a leader, to be a leader at a time that your own homes, your families, your friends, people you know, your community, has been directly hit,\\' Harris said during remarks ahead of a briefing at the North Carolina Air National Guard, which is on the grounds of the airport.\\nHarris\\' visit comes exactly one month ahead of the 2024 presidential election, in which she is locked in a tight race against Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. North Carolina is viewed as a pivotal swing state, and the speed and effectiveness of Biden administration\\'s response efforts could have ramifications on the race.\\nTrump has also visited disaster-struck regions in Georgia, Florida and North Carolina over the last few days.\\nCatch up with the USA TODAY Network\\'s latest updates.\\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, headlined a fundraising event on Saturday for the Harris campaign in Cincinnati, Ohio.\\nThe governor spent at least an hour at the event, which was being held at the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center. Following his stop in Cincinnati, Walz left for Cleveland where he was set to headline another fundraising event.\\n– Rebecca Morin and Sharon Coolidge, USA TODAY Network\\nAs clean-up from Tropical Storm Helene continues across the Southeast, the National Hurricane Center has issued advisories for at least three storm systems. One of those could make landfall on the West Coast of Florida in the next few days.\\nThe National Hurricane Center on Saturday said Tropical Storm Milton is expected to develop into a \"near major hurricane,\" with the risk of life-threatening impacts. The forecast shows the storm approaching the Gulf coast of Florida with winds of 110 mph ahead of a possible mid-week landfall near Tampa.\\nForecasters are also tracking two other storm systems: Hurricane Kirk, a Category 3 storm over open ocean in the Atlantic and Hurricane Leslie, a Category 1 storm following behind Kirk. Neither were expected to make landfall as of Saturday.\\n– Karissa Waddick\\nAs communities across North Carolina continue to recover from Hurricane Helene, FEMA has offered support and staff to the state. Here is a breakdown of what it looks like, according to the White House:\\n– Rebecca Morin\\nNorth Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper thanked FEMA for its \\'massive unprecedented response\\' in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.\\n\\'FEMA has been on the ground with us from the very beginning of this,\\' Cooper told reporters on Saturday before his briefing with Harris.\\nDuring his remarks, Cooper said 68 people died from the storm, which is the official state count. However, local authorities said they believe there are more than 100 who have died from the storm across North Carolina.\\nAs of Saturday, the USA TODAY Network analysis of Helene deaths increased to 228 across the states impacted by the storm.\\n– Rebecca Morin\\nFEMA has deployed more than 1,500 workers to impacted areas in the southeast, officials said. The agency has shipped more than 11.5 million million meals, more than 12.6 million liters of water, 150 generators and more than 400,000 tarps to regions affected by Helene. FEMA has so far approved more than $45 million in up-front emergency aid to victims.\\n– Karissa Waddick\\nPresident Joe Biden urged members of Congress to replenish critical disaster relief programs that have run out of money, or that soon could run out.\\nIn a Friday night letter to congressional leaders, Biden warned that the Small Business Administration\\'s disaster loan program is set to run out of funds in a matter of weeks. He also said the Federal Emergency Management Agency\\'s disaster relief funds could face a shortfall by the end of the year. Biden called on Congress to restore funding and provide FEMA with additional resources.\\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson has suggested Congress can wait until after the election to pass Hurricane relief measures.\\n– Karissa Waddick\\nAs search and rescue teams continue to examine stream beds and debris piles across North Carolina, Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee, the toll of lives lost in Helene\\'s horrific flooding mounts daily. At least 214 people have died as a result of the storm. Hundreds are still missing and officials expect the number to rise.\\nBut already Helene is the fourth deadliest landfalling hurricane in the mainland U.S. since 1950. It ranks behind Hurricane\\'s Katrina (2005), Audrey (1957 and Camille (1969).\\n– Dinah Voyles Pulver\\nDonald Trump is holding a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania on Saturday. The former president returns to the venue where he first survived an assassination attempt in July.\\nTrump held a campaign rally in Fayetteville, North Carolina on Friday evening.\\n– Karissa Waddick\\nDisaster politics are a staple of presidential elections, and this year is no different. With just a month to go until the election, Donald Trump has sought to make Biden and Harris\\' Hurricane Helene a focus of the campaign.\\n\\'There\\'s nobody that\\'s handled a hurricane or storm worse than what they\\'re doing right now,\\' Trump said to supporters Thursday night in Saginaw, Michigan.\\nTrump\\'s indictment has included falsehoods - he claimed that federal disaster money went to migrants and that Georgia GOP Gov. Brian Kemp had trouble reaching Biden, but neither were the case - and the 2024 Republican nominee for the White House has been accused of playing politics with disaster relief during his presidency.\\n– David Jackson\\nKamala Harris pledged \"long lasting\" federal support to get residents and neighborhoods battered by flooding from Helene \"back up and running\" during a visit to Augusta, Georgia earlier this week.\\n\"We\\'re here for the long haul,\" Harris said.\\nThe Biden administration has so far approved requests from Georgia, Florida and North Carolina for the federal government to fully cover the state and local costs of debris removal, search and rescue efforts, mass-feeding and other hurricane-related emergency response activities.\\n– Joey Garrison',\n",

       "   'summary': \"Election Day is just one month away.\\nVoters here in Wisconsin will have a real opportunity to make their voices heard in November. New legislative maps are finally in place, ending the long reign of gerrymandered districts that gave Republicans their disproportionate hold on power for more than a decade.\\nThe GOP's concentrated power led to policies that hurt working families and undermined abortion rights in our state. It also fueled the illegal — and frankly, embarrassing — efforts by Republicans to overturn the 2020 presidential election and to restrict our voting rights.\\nUnfortunately, those efforts continue today. Donald Trump continues to lie about the integrity of our elections and has threatened to make voting harder, and even to jail his opponents, if he wins.\\nHundreds of clerks here in Wisconsin — Republicans and Democrats — have been working tirelessly to ensure that when you cast your ballot this year, it will count. These election workers are your neighbors and friends, who want nothing more than to carry out a fair and secure election.\\nWhen you go to cast your ballot this year, you'll have the opportunity to do so early in-person, by absentee ballot, or at your polling location on Election Day. And, thanks to a recent Wisconsin Supreme Court decision, callous efforts to prohibit the use of secure ballot drop boxes across Wisconsin have been stopped. Drop boxes help folks who have trouble getting to the polls, like those who are disabled or elderly, have a convenient option to cast their ballot. Unfortunately, some communities in Wisconsin are choosing to forgo their use this election, so make sure to plan ahead.\\nThankfully, over the last few years, our governor has been able to stop right-wing bills and efforts to restrict voting rights from becoming law. But bad actors who want to subvert our elections have not stopped there.\\nThey've used the fires of doubt that they themselves lit to justify these efforts — and they're likely to try it again if they win in November. Republicans continue to raise questions about the legitimacy of our elections by spreading falsehoods about noncitizens voting, even though such voting is already illegal in Wisconsin.\\nJudging from the past, there's no telling what radical-right majorities in the legislature might try if Wisconsin voters don't give them the outcome they want. Republican lawmakers could challenge the legitimate vote count in court, try to derail the certification process, or even try to throw out votes.\\nWhen in doubt, get your information from trusted sources like your local election official. We may not know the results on election night, as it sometimes takes several days to count every ballot. This is part of the normal counting process.\\nAre we 'Ready For It?'Taylor Swift endorsement causes voter registration surge.\\nAbove all the noise this election cycle, remember this: you can make a difference by voting in resounding numbers for the kind of leaders you want to represent you. Here's how: Make sure your voter registration is up to date, and if you haven't registered already, do so now at MyVote.WI.gov. Find out the rules for how, where and when to vote, and have a plan to vote. If you vote absentee, make sure to include a witness signature on your ballot to ensure your vote is counted, and get it in the mail so it arrives before Election Day.\\nWhen we work together and participate in our democracy, we can build a better state and a stronger country.\\nBe informed, be patient on Election Day, and above all, vote.\",\n",

       "   'summary': 'If Bart and Cherry Starr were having people over to watch a Green Bay Packers game, you could count on cucumber cream cheese dip being part of the spread.\\nIt was a simple recipe that Cherry whipped up and served with chips or crackers.\\n\\'It definitely reminds me of them,\\' said eldest grandaughter, Shannon Starr, who has warm memories of game-day gatherings with her grandparents at their home in Birmingham, Alabama. \\'It was a staple in their house.\\'\\nIt\\'s one of the 32 recipes from NFL families featured in \\'Cooking with the Starrs,\\' a new hardcover cookbook published by the Starr Children\\'s Fund in her memory.\\nBefore her death in February at age 89, Cherry had come up with the idea for the cookbook as a new initiative to benefit childhood cancer research, a cause that was dear to her and Bart, the late legendary Packers quarterback to whom she was married for 65 years.\\nAll proceeds from the book, which came out Tuesday, benefit the Bart & Cherry Starr Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Fellowship Fund at Children\\'s of Alabama for bone marrow treatment.\\nThe 44-page cookbook offers all kinds of options for a tailgate or watch party, including something called a \"brat hot tub\" and a couple of Cherry\\'s favorite dips, but there are also Christmas cookies, bison meat sauce with pasta, chicken chili, soups, carrot cake banana bread with white chocolate chips and Shannon\\'s own peanut butter cookies.\\nThe list of contributors includes several with Packers connections. BreAnne LaFleur, wife of head coach Matt LaFleur, shared a chicken salad recipe, and running back AJ Dillon\\'s wife, Gabrielle, offered up her baked potato soup recipe. John Lombardi, the grandson of coach Vince Lombardi, contributed as well.\\nAmong the recipes representing other NFL families is southern fried catfish from Tamela Davis, wife of New Orleans Saints linebacker Demario Davis, and chicken piccata from Gabriella Watt, wife of Pittsburgh Steelers fullback Derek Watt.\\nBecause no cookbook would be complete without Mama Kelce (aka Donna Kelce), the well-known, cookie-baking mother of Travis Kelce (Kansas City Chiefs) and Jason Kelce (formerly of the Philadelphia Eagles), she has a recipe for baked sweet and spicy chicken breasts in there, too. Her sons gave the project a shout-out on their \"New Heights\" podcast on Wednesday, teasing that their mom never once made that dish for them.\\nThe cookbook also includes family photos.\\nCherry was beloved by Packers fans and known as a mother figure to many, so it\\'s no surprise that food from her kitchen was just another way she nurtured and nourished relationships, especially when she was at Lambeau Field.\\nShe made former Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers brownies on more than a few occasions.\\n\\'She adored Aaron, and he was so sweet to her and my grandfather as well,\" Shannon said. \"He really was kind to them and went out of his way to make time for them.\\'\\nPackers president and CEO Mark Murphy is a big fan of Cherry\\'s pimento cheese dip. She never forgot that.\\n\\'It was always great to see Cherry and Bart when they came to Green Bay. What really made it special though, was that Cherry always brought pimento dip. For a native western New Yorker, this southern specialty was delicious,\\' Murphy said in an emailed comment to the Green Bay Press-Gazette.\\nWithin the Starr family, Cherry was known for a \\'really, really delicious\\' sweet potato casserole she made every Thanksgiving, Shannon said. For years, she made a lemon icebox pie for Bart Starr Jr.\\'s birthday that was one of his favorites. Both recipes are in the cookbook.\\nPackers Sundays were always a big day at the Starr house.\\n\\'We\\'d show up maybe about 30 minutes before the game would start and we would hang out for a few hours and eat and nibble throughout the game. Not talk too much because the football is serious,\\' Shannon said, laughing. \\'So you\\'ve got to focus on what is happening in front of you, but definitely wonderful memories. Bart and Cherry were always fantastic hosts.\\'\\nMore:From Connecticut to Green Bay with love: Couple\\'s new Packers polka has Pulaski roots, Wisconsin lyrics and a big heart\\nMore:Packers fan\\'s 1972 green and gold Cadillac, a Lambeau Field tailgating fixture since 1990, destroyed by fire\\nThe couple raised $16 million to fight cancer in their lifetimes, Shannon said. The cookbook project is another way to continue their legacy of giving back through the Starr Children\\'s Fund.\\nCherry was already in her 80s when it was founded in 2017 to raise money to support pediatric cancer research and treatments. It was a time in her life when her plate was already full as she cared for Bart after two strokes, a heart attack and a series of seizures in 2014.\\nBut Cherry had a way of getting things done.\\n\\'She was a powerhouse, pint-sized little lady,\\' Shannon said. \\'Cherry really dedicated a lot of her time raising awareness for cancer research, so I\\'m going to keep that going for her as long as I can.\\'\\nShe\\'s certain her grandmother would be so proud a project that started with her vision has been completed. Cherry would be telling everyone about the cookbook, she said.\\n\\'I\\'m thrilled that people have already taken such an interest in our project and they continue to care about the causes that were near and dear to Bart and Cherry,\" Shannon said. \"They left a really positive imprint I think on so many places, but most noticeably in Wisconsin and, of course, my home state of Alabama.\\'\\n\\'Cooking with the Starrs\\' sells for $30 and is available at starrchildrensfund.org, the Packers Pro Shop and at the new Bart and Cherry Starr Museum at Rawhide Youth Services near New London.',\n",

I would be better off dying instead of leaving my family generational debt,\" she says. \"There\\'s times when it\\'s in the back of my head that it would have been easier had I died. Then you don\\'t have to worry about the reoccurrence of another tumor, more bills every time you go for another checkup. All of it just keeps adding up and adding up.\"\\nHinchley was first diagnosed with a brain tumor \"the size of a grapefruit\" in 2006. In 2013, it had returned, along with a breast cancer diagnosis.\\nShe credits the Affordable Care Act, the 2010 health care law also referred to as Obamacare, with saving her life and her business by providing her affordable coverage.\\nIn 2017, congressional Republicans under Republican former President Donald Trump\\'s administration failed to overhaul the ACA. Trump has continued to criticize the law while campaigning for the 2024 election.\\n\\'We\\'re going to fight for much better health care than Obamacare. Obamacare is a catastrophe,\\' he said in a Jan. 6 campaign speech in Iowa.\\nMore:Donald Trump plans Sunday return to Wisconsin, a fourth event in nine days\\nThe former president\\'s messaging around Obamacare has since waned, though. He said during last month\\'s debate against Harris that he\\'d only replace the Affordable Care Act if he sees a better and less expensive option. He could not offer the details of his plan and said he\\'d have more to add in the near future.\\nThe Harris campaign has seized on those remarks, launching an ad this week quoting his statement that he has \"concepts of a plan.\"\\n\"Farmers and people in the rural communities depend on affordable health care. Trump doesn\\'t care if he takes away health care from us. He doesn\\'t care what the consequences would be for me and my family,\" Hinchley says in a radio spot, adding that Harris has pledged to protect and expand the ACA. \"She fought for us to get health care, and she\\'s fighting for us to keep it.\"\\nThe ad is part of a $370 million fall paid media campaign from Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\\nIt will air nationally during programming including the YellaWood 500 NASCAR Cup Series race, the American Music Awards and the 60 Minutes election special, as well as on local broadcast and cable in battleground markets, according to the campaign.\"Winning rural voters means showing up and talking to them about the issues that matter most to their families,\" said Harris-Walz director of rural outreach Matt Hildreth in a statement. \"We\\'re leveraging our historic war chest and infrastructure across battleground states to relentlessly pursue persuadable voters in rural areas and red counties and cut into Trump\\'s margins. In an election that will be decided by a handful of votes in just a few key states, we\\'re leaving no stone unturned.\"\\nA Marquette University Law School poll released last month showed that 5% of registered Wisconsin voters listed health care as their most important issue — but 49% of voters saw Harris as better on the issue compared to 36% who preferred Trump. A new poll is set to be released Wednesday.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'RHINELANDER - An Oneida County man with a well-known family name in the Northwoods claims he was targeted by a sheriff\\'s deputy because he is Indigenous, following an incident in a Walmart parking lot that left him with a head injury.\\nHe also contends the incident reflects broader hostility toward tribal members in the area.\\nA sheriff\\'s department captain said the treatment of Thomas Maulson was well within bounds, and that being a member of the Lac du Flambeau tribe was irrelevant. He said he was disappointed that Maulson raised the issue of targeting and being Indigenous, and said he feared it would foster unnecessary divisiveness.\\nMaulson, 43, of Woodruff, said he was the subject of a road rage incident March 30 in which a driver followed him into a Rhinelander parking lot and challenged him to a fight. The two briefly tussled, but soon made up and the other driver drove away.\\nHowever, an Oneida County sheriff\\'s deputy pulled up, approached the vehicle and asked Maulson for his driver\\'s license and registration. Maulson asked, \\'For what?\\' according to the police report. Taege then asked Maulson why he was breathing heavy, according to the report, and Maulson replied, \\'Does it matter?\\'\\nAt that point, Taege said in his report, he realized Maulson was a \\'no\\' person and was not complying, so the deputy pulled Maulson out of his car to arrest him. Maulson repeatedly asked, \"What did I do?\" Taege\\'s dashcam video shows Taege handling Maulson, who is handcuffed, and Maulson falling to the pavement, hitting his head.\\nMaulson\\'s attorney, Maggie Hogan, said Taege did not give Maulson enough time to comply. Maulson and Hogan also argue Taege tripped Maulson while pushing him hard, causing the fall. Moments later, another officer arrived and helped lift Maulson from the ground. In the dashcam video, blood is seen streaming across Maulson\\'s face.\\nCaptain Tyler Young of the Oneida County Sheriff\\'s Department reviewed the incident and said Taege acted appropriately. Young said Taege also had the options of a taser, pepper spray or focused strikes, which he did not use.\\nHe said Taege observed that Maulson was agitated, and Taege was trying to get the situation under control. As for the fall, the sheriff\\'s office contends Maulson\\'s legs were crossed and he tripped himself.\\nMaulson said nothing was ever out of control.\\nHe contends he was targeted by Taege because he is a member of the Lac du Flambeau Ojibwe Nation. He said many residents in the area hold animosity toward the tribe, dating back to the so-called Walleye Wars in the 1980s and early \\'90s, and continuing to this day because of an ongoing dispute over access to non-tribal homes located on the Lac du Flambeau reservation.\\nNotably, the police dispatcher told Taege before the altercation and arrest that he should be looking for Maulson from Flambeau, according to a motion filed by Maulson\\'s attorney. But Taege later said he didn\\'t know Maulson was a tribal member.\\nMaulson shares a name with his uncle, a well-known former tribal president and leader of the tribe during the Walleye Wars. Books have been written about his uncle, and about his actions leading up to a federal court decision that the state wrongfully prohibited Ojibwe members from harvesting fish in the Northwoods outside of the state-designated fishing season. The judge said those rights were guaranteed by treaty.\\nMany non-tribal people in the area protested the decision.\\nYoung acknowledged some isolated incidents of harassment against tribal members harvesting walleye do still occur. But, he said, Taege is too young to remember the controversy. Further, he said the road access issue only affects a small number of people and is essentially a private matter. Maulson\\'s \"actions are what caused him to be on the ground,\\' Young said.\\nMaulson also said he and other tribal members choose not to have or display tribal license plates for fear of being targeted by police outside the reservations. Maulson uses Wisconsin plates.\\nYoung said plates are not a big deal. \\'I feel bad that somebody feels scared to have tribal plates,\\' he said.\\nMaulson was charged with misdemeanor disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. The other driver was caught by Rhinelander police and charged with disorderly conduct.\\nMaulson\\'s wife, Rachel Maulson, said their children, ages 6 and 2 at the time, were traumatized by the incident. She said the older one still has a visceral reaction when he sees police. \\'He was taught to respect authority, so he\\'s confused why they would hurt his loved one,\\' Rachel Maulson said. \\'When a cop drives by he\\'s nervous.\\'\\nMaulson received 13 stitches above his right eye, and said he still has medical issues affecting his vision and orientation.\\nMaulsen said he plans to sue the sheriff\\'s office and the deputy, but his attorney told him to hold off until this case is settled. Hogan said a trial is scheduled for early January.',\n",

WalletHub used 45 data points to determine each city's overall livability score, ranging from homeownership rates and job growth to average commute times and density of restaurants.\\nOnly cities with a population between 25,000 and 100,000 people were eligible for the ranking.\\nHere are the two best small Wisconsin cities to live in, as well as some other places in the state that ranked high in the nationwide analysis.\\nBrookfield, a Milwaukee-area suburb of about 41,000 people, is the second-best small city to live in nationwide, according to WalletHub.\\nThe city ranked particularly high for its economic stability. Brookfield's 3% unemployment rate is one of the lowest in the country, and city residents have the 96th-highest homeownership rate in the country. Only 3% of Brookfield residents live in poverty, which was among the lowest percentages of the thousand-plus cities evaluated for the study.\\nBrookfield's strong economy might also be a contributor to its positive health outcomes. Over 98% of its residents have health insurance, and the city logged among the lowest percentages of people in fair or poor health in the study.\\nWalletHub also found a higher percentage of adults in Brookfield have time for leisure outside of work than most U.S. cities. And the city also ranked high for public safety, with pedestrian fatality rates in the city coming in at 19th-lowest in the country.\\nMore:Photos of Wirth Park inclusive playground grand opening\\nJust a few spots behind Brookfield, east-central Wisconsin city Appleton came in at fifth place in the ranking.\\nAppleton placed highest for its quality of life, ranking 64th out of more than 1,300 cities. It also placed among the top 200 cities for its affordability, safety, and education and health.\\nWith plenty of outdoor recreation and a low cost of living, Appleton has earned several accolades recently as an under-appreciated, affordable gem in Wisconsin. With a median home value of about $200,000, the city enjoys home prices well below the statewide average and boasts a thriving arts and culture scene.\\nAlongside Wisconsin, Indiana landed two cities in the top five.

(all times in HST, via Time and Date):\\nAccording to NASA, eye protection is necessary when looking at a partial or annular eclipse.

       "   'summary': '\"Chour-io! Chour-io!\"\\nThe cheers from the left-field stands at American Family Field regaled Milwaukee\\'s budding superstar, the 20/20 20-year-old who just made back-to-back major contributions to a potential playoff victory.\\nThere was still one hiccup to come for Chourio, however, followed by an avalanche of bad news when the New York Mets went on to score five runs in the inning and stage an 8-4 win over the Brewers in the opening game of a best-of-three National League wild card series.\\nIn the bottom of the fourth, Chourio\\'s RBI single – initially ruled a hustle double before an error was retroactively assessed to center fielder Tyrone Taylor – had just tied the game, part of a rally that gave the Brewers a 4-3 lead. It was already Chourio\\'s second playoff hit after a single in the first.\\nOne batter into the top of the fifth, Chourio\\'s leaping catch at the wall may have taken away a Starling Marte home run and momentarily preserved a tenuous 4-3 lead that Milwaukee had procured later in the fourth. Each scoreboard replay brought a new round of cheers, not to mention the Chourio-specific chants from the stands.\\nThen came Taylor\\'s fly to left, more of a line drive than Marte\\'s. Chourio awkwardly raced back, reached up, and lost the ball off his glove for a double. The inning spiraled thereafter.\\n\"That one kind of got up there in the windows and I didn\\'t get to see it too well off the jump,\" Chourio said, referring to the windows above the grandstand on both base lines.\\nIt wouldn\\'t be the only blemish in the inning. Joel Payamps was late covering first on what could have been the final out. The Mets strung together four bounding singles. One of them was a tough play for Willy Adames that he might make on another day. The end result: A five-run rally, all after two outs, that turned the tide in Milwaukee\\'s 8-4 loss in Game 1 of the wild card series.\\n\"We just have to keep going today,\" Chourio said. \"Some of the opportune hits didn\\'t come about, but tomorrow\\'s a new day and we have to come out ready to go.\"\\n\"It\\'s a tough left field out there this time of day,\" Brewers manager Pat Murphy said of a game that began at 4:30 p.m., making it dusk around the fateful fifth. \"So that second ball, although should have been caught, give the kid credit. It\\'s a tough line drive in that sun. That\\'s the one spot of the field that\\'s tough. He doesn\\'t catch that ball, and now we\\'ve got to get four outs. Payamps gets the next out, then he doesn\\'t cover first, and then two infield hits ...\"\\nThe fifth inning is the story, but if the Brewers are going to win two straight games and sneak away with the series, it\\'s going to take still more output from Chourio, who\\'s been one of the team\\'s brightest spots in the second half.\\n\"I was very excited,\" Chourio said of his first playoff game. \"I was just very grateful to have that opportunity to be in that position, be in that moment, and I was very happy to get that opportunity.\"\\n\"Jackson was fantastic, man,\" Murphy said. \"He\\'s 20 years old. Twenty years old. To play the defense he played in that setting, some of his good at-bats, he\\'s swinging, and he\\'s a special player. I\\'m really happy for him.\\n\"I get happy when a player knows he belongs, you know what I mean? \\'Hey, I belong. And I like the big moments. And I like being in this situation, and I expect a lot out of myself.\\' That translates to a really, really good all-star type player.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'WASHINGTON – A dozen bipartisan senators representing the states that have been devastated by Hurricane Helene on Tuesday requested Congress approve additional resources to help clean up in the wake of the disaster. They\\'re also joining President Joe Biden in urging lawmakers to consider an emergency session before Election Day to get their work done.\\nIn a letter to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the Democratic and Republican senators from North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Tennessee and Virginia wrote that the damage wrought by the hurricane will be at least in the tens of billions of dollars.\\n\"Although the true level of devastation is still unfolding, it is clear that Congress must act to meetthe unmet needs in our states and address the scope and scale of destruction experienced by ourconstituents,\" the senators wrote. \"This may even require Congress to come back in October to ensure we have enough time to enact legislation before the end of this calendar year.\"\\nAt least 144 people have been killed by the storm, including 64 in North Carolina, 36 in South Carolina, 25 in Georgia, 11 in Florida, six in Tennessee and two in Virginia, according to a USA TODAY analysis. Hundreds of others remain missing amid power outages, destroyed roadways, flooding and crushed buildings.\\nCongress is scheduled to be out of session until at least Nov. 12. But lawmakers from affected states in both chambers have been urging their colleagues to come back to Washington to approve additional funds to help address the fall out.\\nBiden approved disaster declarations for Florida and North Carolina on Sunday. On Monday, he said he is likely to ask Congress for additional funding for the affected states, calling it a \"historic storm,\" and that he may call lawmakers back to Washington to approve it.\\nBut House Speaker Mike Johnson appeared to throw cold water on that idea Tuesday during remarks to the New York Stock Exchange.\\n\\'Congress has previously provided the funds it [FEMA] needs to respond, so we will make sure that those resources are appropriately allocated,\\' Johnson said, referencing the government funding extension passed last week, funding the government through Dec. 20.\\nThat package includes $20 billion of funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and a mechanism for the agency to spend it quickly. However that is an extension of current funding levels, rather than additional funding for disaster relief programs.',\n",

I hated it. I\\'d get other people, I shouldn\\'t say this, but I\\'d get other people in. I wouldn\\'t pay.\\'\\nProgress for many workers\\' rights issues was stagnant leading into 2016, and Trump tapped into that frustration, Celine McNicholas, policy director at nonpartisan research organization Economic Policy Institute Action, previously told USA TODAY.\\n\"He was maybe the first Republican in a long time to kind of, like actually give some voice to that outrage,\" she said. \"But I think it stops there.\"\\nShe said he proposed cuts to worker protection agencies, and Economic Policy Institute called moves under his administration to overturn worker protections \"unprecedented.\"\\n\"With the incredible flurry of activity that...came from the Trump administration, the chaos, I think, actually served to....obfuscate their actual progress on some of these anti-worker and anti-fair economy policies that they really consistently pushed forward,\" McNicholas said.\\nDespite the administration\\'s reputation for being anti-union, the national Teamsters union withheld its endorsement from either Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris, though a slew of swing state locals independently endorsed the Democratic nominee.\\nThe ILA has not announced an endorsement in the 2024 presidential race but put their weight behind then candidate Joe Biden in 2020.\\nThe ILA is looking for a 61.5% pay increase over six years, according to CNBC.\\nIt\\'s also concerned about automation. In June, it halted talks with port operator USMX over an automation dispute. In a release then, the ILA said \\'ILA President (Harold) Daggett made it clear that the union will take a firm stance against any technology that threatens ILA jobs.\\'',\n",

Water St. back in December, plans to open around Thanksgiving, Milwaukee County Parks assistant director of business services Joe Mrozinski told the Journal Sentinel. This means the café should be open just in time for Red Arrow Park\\'s popular Slice of Ice winter skating season.\\nBiggby Coffee will replace the Starbucks that stood in the park for nearly 20 years before closing at the end of November. Milwaukee County Parks officials served skaters hot chocolate, coffee and treats after the Starbucks closure, and they quickly began searching for a new vendor for the space. Biggby Coffee was awarded the contract after a \"competitive bid process,\" Mrozinski said.\\nRemodeling construction on the café began in late September. The space is getting a \"nice refresh\" to have a similar feel to other Biggby Coffee shops, he continued.\\nThe new coffee shop is owned by Milwaukee natives Keith Washington and Curtis Grace. The pair also own a Biggby Coffee location in Franklin at 7700 S. Lovers Lane Road #100 and plans to open another in Cudahy at 5861 S. Packard Ave. after a long delay in construction. There is another Biggby Coffee shop in Waukesha at N20 W22951 Watertown Road with different owners.\\nBiggby Coffee was founded in East Lansing, Mich., in 1995. The franchise now has nearly 400 locations throughout the U.S., including multiple Wisconsin stores in Wausau, Sheboygan, Appleton, Green Bay, Marshfield and others. The café menu includes lattes, hot chocolate, cold brew coffee, smoothies and ready-to-go food items like breakfast sandwiches, cookies, muffins and bagels.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'When Vice President Kamala Harris campaigns in Ripon today, she\\'ll be visiting the birthplace of the Republican Party.\\nAnd that\\'s not a mistake. Harris will be joined by former Rep. Liz Cheney, who was born in Madison and is one of the most prominent Republican critics of Trump in the country. The campaign also touted endorsements from former Republican Wisconsin lawmakers ahead of the Thursday event.\\nAccording to a senior campaign official, Harris plans to address the significance of the Little White School House, which hosted meetings that helped form the Republican Party in 1854. Harris will nod to the history of the traditional party and make appeals to independent and Republican voters, the official said.\\nHere\\'s what to know about the history of Ripon, which isn\\'t the only place to claim status as the birthplace of the Grand Old Party.\\nThe Little White Schoolhouse was built in 1853 as the first public school building in Ripon. On March 20, 1854, it hosted a meeting that brought together Whigs, Democrats and Free Soilers, who created a new entity called the Republican Party.\\nThe group \"believed that their respective parties could not prevent the extension of slavery to the north,\" according to the Wisconsin Historical Society. \"They come out of the schoolhouse in agreement that one unified front was crucial to the fight against slavery and thus began the Republican Party.\"\\nMore:The Republican Party started in Wisconsin. Here\\'s what to know about the GOP\\'s history\\nFrom 1860 to 1908, the building was a private residence and the home of newspaper publisher, author and politician George W. Peck, who had been elected mayor of Milwaukee and governor of Wisconsin in the 1890s.\\nThe Little White Schoolhouse was designated a National Historic Site in 1974. It was re-listed as a historic place after moving in 2023 — the third time it\\'s been relocated — to a location with better visibility and accessibility. The free-admission museum is open to visitors during the summer and arranges tours during other seasons.\\nA replica of the schoolhouse, built by high schoolers, was also brought to the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee this summer. Ripon got a shoutout from Republican Party of Wisconsin chairman Brian Schimming during the delegate roll call.\\nMore:Little White Schoolhouse replica, constructed by high school students, headed to Milwaukee for Republican National Convention\\nJackson, Michigan, has also claimed status as the birthplace of the Republican Party. On July 6, 1854, a convention was held to nominate a statewide anti-slavery ticket. Similar conventions followed in other states, adopting the Republican Party label.\\nFor years, the Republican National Committee\\'s website included the Ripon meeting and the Jackson convention in its origin story. The website currently refers to neither specific event, only that the party was \"initially united in 1854 by the promise to abolish slavery.\"\\nRipon is located in Fond du Lac County, a county that voted about 63% for former President Donald Trump in 2020.\\nThe city has a population of around 8,000 people. Depending on your definition of the Fox Valley, Ripon is located southwest of the Fox Cities, like Appleton and Neenah.\\nHarris will speak at Ripon College, a private liberal arts college that enrolls about 800 undergraduates. The college was founded in 1851.\\nMore:What communities are part of the Fox Cities? And are they different from the Fox Valley?',\n",

       "   'excerpt': 'The program empowers people to implement their ideas to combat hunger, from making fruit fun for kids to helping food insecure cancer patients.',\n",
       "   'summary': 'A few years ago, Long Vue attended a salmon run — an annual event when salmon migrate to rivers in order to spawn — because he thought it would be fascinating to see so many fish swimming upstream.\\nAs Vue realized that most of the salmon died after the run, he worried that all those fish went to waste. When he asked, he learned that some would go to food pantries, some would be thrown away, and the rest would be used as fertilizer. Vue, who is the executive director of Appleton-based nonprofit Northeast Wisconsin Hmong Professionals, was told that if he wanted to give the fish to some of the Hmong elders served by his nonprofit — many of whom don\\'t have access to the fresh fish and produce that are so important to their culture — he would need the backing of an established food insecurity organization.\\nRaul Romo is a community engagement coordinator at the Medical College of Wisconsin Cancer Center. For several years, he worked as a medical interpreter for Spanish-speaking patients, where he learned that many people going through cancer treatment also deal with food insecurity. He wanted to bring attention to the problem so there would be a streamlined way to screen cancer patients for food insecurity and provide them with resources, food pantries near their homes and even food prescriptions from their doctors.\\nBoth these ideas fit perfectly with the mission of Feeding America Eastern Wisconsin\\'s Food Leaders Lab, a program to combat hunger that started in 2022 in Milwaukee and Appleton. Through the program, community members who have ideas to address food insecurity attend seven monthly sessions organized by Feeding America where they explain their ideas, tailor them to something achievable, are mentored by subject-area experts, and come away from the program with a fully developed campaign and a network of people who can help them implement their idea.\\nMatt Stienstra, the organization\\'s director of strategic partnerships and programs, said the lab works to mine the talents and ideas of a group of people who weren\\'t getting enough attention in the fight against food insecurity.\\n\"It became clear that there\\'s a ton of incredibly smart people who know how to source food and get it to food pantries, and there\\'s national organizations that do a great job thinking about how policies impact hunger and food insecurity,\" Stienstra said. \"But there are also a ton of people in the community who have lived experience with hunger and food insecurity, either through having gone through it themselves or working with people who do.\\n\"These are the people who are going to know how to fix it.\"\\nRomo said a key lesson he learned through the Food Leaders Lab is that \"no idea is too small.\"\\nIn fact, in a lot of ways, according to both Romo and Stienstra, smaller ideas are better; often, the problem of hunger can seem so big as to be too overwhelming to solve. But it\\'s the components of hunger, the smaller communities that experience it, the specific ways in which they experience it, that can seem easier to tackle with discrete solutions.\\nImani Raiyne creates displays out of fruit for parties and events in the Milwaukee area. She also leads fruit art workshops in schools. While running an after-school workshop at an MPS school one day, she watched as a few kids threw away the oranges and apples they were given for a snack by school staff, then walked over to her table and created art from apples and oranges — which they were then happy to eat.\\nRealizing that kids are more likely to eat food that\\'s fun, the Fruitz Lady — as she\\'s known by both students and clients — joined the Food Leaders Lab and implemented another idea to make healthy food more attractive by creating fun TikTok-like videos with the kids.\\n\"When they come to us in that first week with their ideas, what we do is help narrow the focus and to pick a problem that they can actually solve,\" Stienstra said. \"We let them know about existing programs that might be available to them, then each month we work on helping them put together a realistic campaign with the tools and partners to actually solve the problems they identified in the first week.\"\\nStienstra said that in the most recent cohort, there was an ambassador who had noticed that some schools weren\\'t taking advantage of federal funds for a school breakfast program; Feeding America brought in a nutrition director to explain how school budgets work so the ambassador could \"speak the language\" in their proposal. Another ambassador was concerned that funding for low-income people to buy produce at farmers markets wasn\\'t reliably available each year; through the Food Leaders Lab, they met mentors with fundraising experience to teach them to seek out sustainable funding sources.\\nDuring his time with the Food Leaders Lab, Vue had conversations with people at the DNR who explained everything that goes into making sure the salmon that were part of the run were safe to eat; Vue also learned how much money would have to be raised to get the salmon processed.\\n\"I learned that the DNR needed to feel comfortable with the group that they would be giving the fish to,\" Vue said. \"They were comfortable giving it to Feeding America, and through them, we can get some of the salmon to the members of the Hmong community.\"\\nIn addition to sharing information the ambassadors need to implement their ideas, the presenters and mentors at Food Leaders Lab workshops also help the ambassadors develop their campaigns and put together presentations they can give to potential funders and partners.\\nRomo, who\\'s part of the Milwaukee cohort of ambassadors that just graduated from the Food Leaders Lab, said the members of the group recently presented their projects to each other.\\n\"Part of my presentation is explaining that food insecurity doesn\\'t discriminate, and cancer doesn\\'t discriminate, either. I asked them to imagine fighting the battle of your life against cancer on an empty stomach or malnourished system,\" Romo said. \"I learned how impactful it is to present something you\\'re knowledgeable about because you have the facts and the data and you can present that through your experience and connect with people through those emotions.\"\\nSome ambassadors are able to get funding and implement their programs during their time at the lab, or soon after. Others come away with a campaign to present to possible funders, plus a new network of people who are as dedicated to solving hunger as they are.\\nStill others have been able to get their projects funded through the federally funded Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program - Education (SNAP-Ed). For example, Vue — who has established gardening programs for Hmong elders through Northeast Wisconsin Hmong Professionals — has been working on a new project through SNAP-Ed to research foraging regulations and permissions as an additional way for Hmong elders to have access to the food that is culturally important to them.\\nAccording to Stienstra, many of the Food Leaders Lab graduates are similar to Vue in that they have lots of ideas to solve the problems they see in their communities, and that the people they meet and skills they gain in the lab put them in a good position to continue to advocate for their communities.\\n\"We don\\'t dictate the types of issues the leaders should be looking for or the problems they should be solving,\" Stienstra said. \"The big picture is that when leaders see problems in their communities a year from now or whatever, they can use the tools they learned in Leaders Lab to build a campaign.\\n\"We view Food Leaders Lab as a problem-solving program.\"\\nMore information: For more information, or to apply for the next Food Leaders Lab cohort, visit feedingamericawi.org/get-involved/lab/.\\nDuring October, USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin newspapers and Feeding America Eastern Wisconsin are working together to raise enough money from readers and donors to provide 750,000 meals to Wisconsin families through the annual Stock the Shelves campaign.

       "   'summary': \"A pair of heroic and historic swings by 20-year-old Jackson Chourio wouldn't let the Milwaukee Brewers' season end Wednesday night.\\nBut he wasn't the only young Milwaukee outfielder that might as well have been donning a pinstriped cape.\\nTrailing 3-2 in Game 2 of the National League wild-card series to the New York Mets with six outs remaining in the Brewers' season, Chourio led off the eighth inning with his second solo home run of the night to tie the game at 3-3.\\nA few batters later, with Phil Maton still pitching for the Mets, pinch hitter Garrett Mitchell smacked a two-run shot that sent both the crowd at American Family Field and MLB social media into a frenzy. It was the first pitch Mitchell saw after Willy Adames singled with two outs off an 0-2 pitch.\\nInstead of another disappointing early exit in the playoffs, the Brewers suddenly have momentum after rallying for a 5-3 victory to force a deciding Game 3 against the Mets.\\nChourio is the second player in MLB history to hit two game-tying home runs in a postseason game. He also led off with a homer in the first inning with the Brewers trailing 1-0.\\nIn the most pressure-packed of situations, both Chourio and Mitchell were not fazed in the least.\\nAn undaunted duo indeed that earned a slew of cyberspace appreciation posts.\",\n",

It wasn\\'t sanctioned. They had no permission to be here. They have to go through the management office, and no one did that.\"\\nEmails forwarded to the Journal Sentinel show Hengst reached out to the management office over email and phone five days ahead of when they hoped to hold the event and multiple times after.\\nInstead, Sellin reached out to Shorewood Village Clerk Toya Harrell Wednesday morning to schedule a separate voter registration event later in the month through the village.

       "   'summary': 'President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris surveyed communities battered by flooding from Hurricane Helene during separate trips on Wednesday spanning three southeastern states as both vowed the federal government won\\'t leave until the recovery is complete and with the 2024 White House campaign heading into its final stretch.\\nBiden stopped in Greenville, South Carolina, and took an aerial tour of the devastation in nearby Asheville, North Carolina, before receiving an emergency operational briefing in the state capital of Raleigh. Harris traveled separately to Augusta, Georgia, where she provided an update on federal support for emergency response and recovery efforts.\\n\"I\\'m here to thank you and to listen,\" Harris, the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee, said at the head of a long table at the Augusta Emergency Operations Center, with local officials and emergency personnel seated on both sides.\\nMore:Hurricane Helene collides with 2024 election as Trump goes to Georgia, Harris plans visit\\nThe nation\\'s top two executives did not cross paths as Biden visited the battleground state of North Carolina and Harris traveled to another swing state, Georgia, just 34 days before Election Day.\\nThe death toll across the Southeast was at least 162 Wednesday and was expected to rise. Buncombe County, home to Asheville, has reported 57 deaths. The aftermath of Hurricane Helene has collided with the politics of the 2024 election – with the speed, quality and disputes over federal aid posing potential election ramifications in both Georgia and North Carolina.\\nRepublican nominee Donald Trump, who visited Valdosta, Georgia, on Monday, has tried to make the Biden administration\\'s hurricane response into a campaign issue. He slammed the president and Harris on social media last weekend for not immediately visiting the region and falsely claimed that Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, was unable to reach Biden to discuss emergency aid.\\nAdministration officials said Harris and Biden were waiting to travel because they didn\\'t want to divert police and first responders working on both recovery and clean up. They also noted Biden and Kemp had spoken the day before Trump incorrectly said they hadn\\'t connected.\\nMore:Heartbreak across 6 states: Here are some who lost lives in Hurricane Helene\\nDuring her visit on Wednesday, Harris hugged and consoled residents in an Augusta neighborhood where toppled trees were visible in front yards and wooden debris covered parts of roads.\\n\"It is particularly devastating in terms of the loss of life that this community has experienced, the loss of normalcy and the loss of critical resources,\" Harris said. \"And so I\\'m here today to thank all of those who are working to get folks the support and the relief that they so desperately need.\"\\nHarris vowed \"long-lasting\" coordination from the federal government to get families, residents and neighborhoods \"back up and running.\"\\n\"We\\'re here for the long haul,\" Harris said.\\nBiden took his aerial tour of Asheville on Marine One, dipping low to view the widespread storm damage. Near the city\\'s historic downtown, Biden and his team could see flattened buildings, gutted structures and knocked down trees. The tour also crossed over Biltmore village, the River Arts district and east Asheville as well as Swannanoa and Black Mountain.\\n\"I\\'m here to say the United States – the nation – has your back. We\\'re not leaving until you\\'re back on your feet completely,\" Biden said at an emergency command center in Raleigh, where he was joined by North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat.\\nBiden said he approved Cooper\\'s request for the federal government to cover 100% of the costs of debris removal and other emergency protective measures over six months.\\nThe president also announced the deployment of up to 1,000 active-duty soldiers to reinforce the North Carolina National Guard\\'s efforts to deliver food, water and medicine to isolated communities in the state.\\n\"In a moment like this, we put politics aside. At least we should put it all aside,\" Biden said. \"We have here. There are no Democrats, Republicans, only Americans. And our job is to help as many people as we can, as quickly as we can and as thoroughly as we can.\"\\nMore:Biden sends 1,000 Army troops to North Carolina for Helene response\\nAsked why Biden and Harris did not travel together, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, \"It was a way to make sure that we cover all fronts.\"\\nSince securing the Democratic nomination, Harris has held just one joint campaign appearance with Biden, who has battled low approval ratings for much of his presidency. The two have not appeared together in any of the four closely contested Sun Belt swing states: North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada.\\nHarris plans to travel to North Carolina to tour flood-damaged communities in the coming days, while Biden is scheduled to go to Georgia and Florida on Thursday without the vice president.\\nHomeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who joined the president\\'s trip on Wednesday, said more than 4,800 federal workers have been deployed for the government\\'s response, including more than 1,000 FEMA workers. The agency has shipped more than 8.8 million meals, 7.4 million liters of water, 150 generators and more than 225,000 tarps to the Southeast.\\nSearch and rescue teams have conducted nearly 1,500 structural evaluations and completed hundreds of rescues and evacuations, Mayorkas said.\\nFEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell remains on the ground in western North Carolina, which was hit particularly hard by flooding, including Asheville. Biden administration officials are bracing for a costly long-term recovery that will take years.\\n\"This is a multi-billion-dollar, multi-year recovery,\" Mayorkas said. \"We have towns that have disappeared, literally.\"\\nBiden said earlier this week that he expects to ask Congress to approve a supplemental spending bill to help cover federal costs for Hurricane Helene relief efforts. A dozen bipartisan senators who represent the states hit hardest by the storm pleaded on Tuesday for their colleagues to also pass legislation with additional resources. They also joined the president in suggesting an emergency session may need to be called before Election Day.\\nIn North Carolina, FEMA has received more than 30,000 applications from individuals seeking disaster relief and so far distributed more than $2.6 million to survivors. Sixty-two percent of power outages reported after the flooding have been restored, with 8,000 crews continuing to assist with additional power restoration, the White House said.\\nThe federal government has also installed 50 Starlink receivers in western North Carolina to help provide internet connectivity.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'You know her, you love her, the internet can\\'t get enough of her.\\nMoo Deng, the bouncy baby pygmy hippo that took pop culture by storm, has put eastern Thailand\\'s Khao Kheow Open Zoo on the map, even prompting the facility to build and expand roadways to accommodate the influx of international visitors.\\nBorn June 10 to mother Jona and father Tony, Moo Deng is the seventh child of the hippo couple and sibling to another famous hippo, Moo Toon. With a name translating to \"bouncing pig,\" her charm has proven all but irresistible to netizens and beyond.\\nAn abundance of tummy rolls and pink chubby cheeks are obvious reasons to love Moo Deng. But some have begun to wonder − is there a more scandalous side to this seemingly wholesome little baby? Is she hiding something from us all? What about all those videos of her biting people? Is she nice to service workers when she goes out to eat?\\nA handful of viral videos have shown Moo Deng squaring up at her zookeeper when he enters her enclosure, leading to some speculation that she may be one of those heroes you don\\'t want to meet.\\nWill these videos prove a PR crisis for Moo Deng? Here\\'s what we know about her behavior in some of the most viral clips about her.\\nWho\\'s that baby hippo on your timeline:Meet the wet, chubby \\'lifestyle icon\\' captivating the internet\\nSome have wondered: will Moo Deng\\'s propensity for diva behavior get her canceled? Will her scandals outshine her merits? Is her star destined to fall instead of shine thanks to her love of chomping down on people?\\nIf you know anything about the internet\\'s love for Moo Deng, that\\'s not likely. In fact, her \"sassiness,\" as fans call it, is part of her charm.\\nMoo Deng\\'s original rise to virality wasn\\'t just about her adorable, chubby looks − it was also about that feisty \\'tude. The internet can\\'t get enough of the baby hippo\\'s cuteness or her tendency to cause a bit of chaos in a very familiar toddler-like way.\\nSome of the most popular and recirculated clips of Moo Deng feature her stomping about, nipping her handler, wriggling and fighting her bath time and traipsing around with her mouth wide open to let the world know she\\'ll do it all again.\\nAll this to say, Moo Deng is a typical strong-headed toddler, just a little chubbier and more slippery, and people can\\'t get enough.\\nWhy does Moo Deng seem to bite her keeper so much? Is she just mean or chomp-happy? And why does her mom never seem to care?\\nSome users online have speculated that Moo Deng is so often caught biting because she is being handled too frequently or roughly by zookeepers, expressing concern over her enclosure and the pressure of all the visitors and attention she is getting. PETA has also made posts commenting on her captivity, a move the Thai Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals criticized while defending Moo Deng\\'s care.\\nUsers pointed out that the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) pygmy hippo care guidelines advise against much direct contact, citing how dangerous the animals become after about one year of age.\\nHowever, others who have reported visiting the zoo defended the facility, highlighting that it was the first in Thailand to join the World Association of Zoos and Aquariums (WAZA), an accrediting agency that sets and maintains standards for captive animal care.\\nChecking Moo Deng\\'s 24/7 live stream will also show that she is only handled for short periods of time each day when her keeper enters the enclosure to feed her mom, defenders pointed out. Because wild monkeys native to the area like to sneak in and chow down on food meant for the zoo\\'s animals, her keeper hangs out in the enclosure until mom has had ample chance to finish her meal.\\nHe also uses that time to bond with the baby, Atthapon Nundee told the New York Times. \\'For the mental health, I build trust with Moo Deng by engaging in conversation\" and by interacting with her physically, he told the Times.\\nHis guess as to why Moo Deng has adopted biting his knees as one of her favorite pastimes? She\\'s likely teething, he told the Times. And she just happens to have a personality that is much for \"bouncy and really feisty\" than her siblings.\\nBetween the tantrums, fights over bathtime and grumpy teething behavior, Moo Deng\\'s behavior is probably sounding pretty familiar to all the parents out there. Her fits, however, are part of bringing money and attention to a bigger cause − with less than 3,000 pygmy hippos left in the wild, the conservation and captive breeding Khao Kheow Open Zoo and other organizations do play a role in the effort to keep the species alive.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'WASHINGTON − For Republican JD Vance, Tuesday night\\'s vice-presidential debate was an opportunity for rebranding.\\nVance presented himself as a candidate willing to work across the aisle. He focused on softening the GOP\\'s stance on abortion and showcasing empathy for his Democratic opponent, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. There were few insults and elbows thrown.\\nThe turn from Vance comes as his running mate, Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris are locked in a razor-thin election and the Republican ticket is picking up ground in some key battleground states.\\nVance appealed to voters through his biography, advocating for bipartisanship and limiting personal attacks against Walz.\\nBefore answering the first debate question Vance introduced himself to the public, \"because I recognize a lot of Americans don\\'t know who either one of us are.\\' The best-selling author noted he was raised in a working class family and went to college on the GI Bill.\\n\\'I stand here asking to be your Vice President with extraordinary gratitude for this country, for the American Dream that made it possible for me to live my dreams,\\' he said.\\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., praised Vance\\'s performance for sticking to the policies and the facts.\\n\\'JD was so good last night because he brought answers and solutions,\\' Johnson said on Fox News on Wednesday. \\'He showed his depth. And he came across as just being very reasonable and likable.\\n\\'I just thought he was at his best,\\' Johnson said.\\nAhead of the debate, Democrats labeled Vance as \\'weird,\\' hit him for past comments about women who do not have children and criticized his overly confident nature. He was also heavily criticized for spreading false rumors that Haitian migrants were eating pets in Springfield, Ohio, which caused turmoil and violence for the community.\\n\"He seemed very slick,\" Democratic National Committee chair Jaime Harrison told reporters after the debate Tuesday. \"Every time JD opened his mouth, he said a lie.\"\\nVance throughout the debate at times appealed to working across the aisle, such as advocating for bipartisan work to address paid family and medical leave.\\nHe also would say he agreed with Walz on certain issues, and even showcased empathy after the Minnesota Governor said his 17-year-old son, Gus, witnessed a shooting at a community center. Vance immediately shook his head in the moment. When it was his turn to respond, Vance was quick to express his sympathies that Walz\\'s son witnessed the shooting.\\n\\'Tim, first of all, I didn\\'t know that your 17-year-old witnessed a shooting,\\' Vance said. \\'I\\'m sorry about that. Christ have mercy. It is awful.\\'\\nThe biggest shift, however, was on abortion. Vance attempted to soften the GOP\\'s views on abortion, a key issue that Harris and Walz have leaned into in key battleground states.\\nVance highlighted a story from a woman he said was \\'very dear to me\\' that had an abortion because she was in an abusive relationship.\\n\\'I think that what I take from that, as a Republican who proudly wants to protect innocent life in this country, who proudly wants to protect the vulnerable, is that my party we\\'ve got to do so much better of a job at earning the American people\\'s trust back on this issue, where they frankly just don\\'t trust us,\\' Vance said.\\nTrump during the debate said he would veto a national abortion ban if one crossed his desk as president. The former president has previously praised the Supreme Court\\'s ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade.\\nBut Vance\\'s performance on Tuesday shows he is hoping to change his image to appeal to a wider swath of voters who are still deciding who to vote for in November.\\nVance\\'s aim to improve his image also comes as Trump and Harris are locked in a tight battle for the presidency.\\nHarris, who jumped into the race after President Joe Biden dropped out of the election in June, saw a bump after she was thrust to the top of the ticket. But Trump has since been making headway in battleground states like Arizona.\\nTrump is leading Harris by 6 percentage points in Arizona 48%-42%, according to a USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll published last week.\\nIn Michigan, another key state, Harris holds a small 3-point lead over Trump, 48% to 45%, according to a USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll.\\nNationally, Harris holds a small lead over Trump, according to an Ipsos poll published Wednesday. Among likely voters, 48% said they would vote for Harris while 44% said they would back Trump.\\nBut with less than 35 days to go, it\\'s unclear whether the vice-presidential running mates will play a role on how voters will cast their ballots.\\nJust 1% of viewers said the vice-presidential debate made them change their mind about who to vote for, a CNN poll after the debate found. Thirteen percent said the debate made them reconsider but did not change their mind.\\nAnd a whopping 86% said the debate had no effect on their choice of president.',\n",

The river is roughly 1,985 feet about sea level, while the estate was built at about 2,200 feet.\\nHelene\\'s strong winds and heavy rainfall damaged homes, businesses, roadways and families as more than 150 people have died due to the hurricane.\\nFloodwaters have devastated the Biltmore Village, which is where the estate\\'s employees are housed. The Swannanoa River, just north of the village, crested at 26.1 feet, nearly 6 feet above the previous record (20.7 feet), according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\\nThe area is still heavily damaged and inaccessible. Interstate 40 is impassable in multiple locations and Interstate 26 is closed at the Tennessee state line, DriveNC.gov said. Non-emergency travel has been prohibited.\\nThe Biltmore Estate has advised its employees to check in with their team members and families to ensure their safety, and to remain away from the museum unless told otherwise by their supervisors.\\nDaytime and overnight guests can request refunds, but it may take them longer than usual to get their money back as the estate works to repair its \"internal network and communication systems.\"\\n\"Your outpouring of concern for our region has been heartwarming and we are deeply grateful to our guests who want to help our community during this challenging time,\" the estate wrote on its website.',\n",

Tim Walz, went head-to-head at the vice-presidential debate Tuesday night. The two sparred about issues such as the crises in the Middle East, Obamacare, immigration, gun regulation, and more. But the internet is reacting to more than their talking points.\\nAfter the politicians were asked questions regarding foreign policy and their stances on abortion, people started honing in on their outfits.\\nDid Walz wear a Taylor Swift-style friendship bracelet during the debate? And what was going on with Vance\\'s tie? Here\\'s how the internet is reacting to the fashion statements at the VP debate.\\n2024 Presidential Election: Read the full transcript of the vice presidential debate between JD Vance and Tim Walz\\nThe tie is stirring up conversations among social media users.\\n\"Vance is disqualified from being Vice President because he chose this tie for tonight\\'s debate,\" said one user on X, formerly known as Twitter, about Tuesday\\'s VP debate.\\nSome are calling the tie tacky, but others are praising him for wearing a pink tie on the first day of October, Breast Cancer Awareness month.\\n\"JD Vance wearing a pink tie to kick off Breast Cancer Awareness month,\" posted user Amelia Foley. \"Love this guy.\"\\nIt is not confirmed if JD Vance wore the tie in light of Breast Cancer Awareness month. The pink representing breast cancer is a pastel pink, according to the National Breast Cancer Foundation. But, the ribbon for inflammatory breast cancer is a fuchsia color, that could resemble Vance\\'s tie.\\nHowever, the tie may not even be a shade of pink.\\nIn some photos, Vance\\'s tie looks red with a pattern on it. But, in other photos, Vance looks like he is wearing a fuchsia tie.\\nUSA TODAY reached out to Vance\\'s office for comment.\\nOther fashion choices at the VP debate include Walz possibly wearing a friendship bracelet.\\nLike Vance\\'s tie, Walz\\'s friendship bracelet garnered criticism and compliments.\\n\"Tim Walz is seriously wearing a Taylor Swift friendship bracelet right now,\" posted X user Lori Love. \"What kind of grown man does that!?\"\\n\"@Tim_Walz wore friendship bracelets during the VP debate, and that should tell you everything you need to know about how good of a person he is,\" said another X user, @kelceswifts.\\nThe bracelet looks like one that the Harris campaign released after Taylor Swift endorsed the presidential hopeful, according to People.\\nThe bracelets, which sold out 12 hours after they were released, according to the Athens Banner-Herald, a part of the USA TODAY Network, are available for pre-order on the campaign\\'s website.\\nThe internet is debating over whether the senator puts on a bit of eyeliner before he makes his public appearances, but that may not be the case.\\n\"I\\'ve met him in person before he was a senator, and I can confirm he has long eyelashes, and they cast a shadow on his waterline when [the] studios are full of lights,\" messaged former Rep. George Santos, who was expelled from the House of Representatives after he was indicted on 23 federal counts, including fraud. \"Grow up people!\"\\nDespite Santos and other social media users coming to defend Vance\\'s long lashes, some online aren\\'t buying it.\\n\"JD Vance\\'s eyeliner makes me giggle every time like \\'yes girl,\\'\" tweeted X user, @lovemepartly.\\nThe claim that Vance wears eyeliner began to circulate in September, according to The Independent.\\n\"Why does JD Vance always look like he\\'s wearing eyeliner?\" quote-tweeted journalist James Surowiecki. \"He doesn\\'t really seem like the goth-boy type.\"\\nAfter that, the floodgates were opened. Social media users started to share instances where the senator seemed to have black-smudged water lines during public appearances.\\nRumors regarding Vance have been circulating since Trump announced that he would be the former president\\'s running mate, including a rather unsavory one involving a couch.\\nContributing: Saman Shafiq, Bart Jansen USA TODAY; Victoria Moorwood, Cincinnati Enquirer; Vanessa Countryman, Athens Banner-Herald.',\n",

       "   'summary': \"Los Angeles health officials have confirmed another case of the mosquito-borne dengue fever, bringing the total number of cases this year to four.\\nThe latest case was confirmed in Panorama City, The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health said in an announcement last week. The patient had not traveled to areas where dengue fever is endemic, the department said.\\nCounty health officials have confirmed the following cases of dengue fever since fall 2023:\\nCalling the latest number of local transmissions 'unprecedented in Los Angeles County,' Dr. Muntu Davis, the Los Angeles County Health Officer, said in a news release the best way to stop the illness from transmission is by limiting mosquito bites and mosquito breeding.\\n'Using insect repellent to prevent mosquito bites, eliminating items that hold standing water around your home where mosquitoes can breed, and using or fixing screens on your doors and windows to keep mosquitoes out of the home are simple steps everyone can take to significantly reduce the risk of mosquito-borne disease for both you and your neighbors,' Davis said about the illness in the release.\\nDengue fever is a mosquito-borne illness that is typically prevalent in tropical and subtropical areas, according to the Mayo Clinic. The illness can cause high fever and flu-like symptoms.\\nThose who are infected with the fever may have severe headache, pain behind the eyes, joint and muscle pain, rash and mild bleeding, the public health department said in its news release.\\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, the fever is caused by one of four types of dengue viruses but you cannot get it from simply being around an infected person. The illness is spread through mosquito bites, typically from mosquitoes in places where humans live.\\n'When a mosquito bites a person infected with a dengue virus, the virus enters the mosquito,' the Mayo Clinic said on its website. 'Then, when the infected mosquito bites another person, the virus enters that person's bloodstream and causes an infection.'\\nOnce people have recovered from the fever, they are immune to the type of virus that infected them, usually on a long-term basis, the clinic said. Still, they can become infected again by one of the other three virus types. If people are infected for a second, third or fourth time, they may develop severe dengue fever.\\nSevere dengue can lead to shock, severe bleeding and severe organ impairment, the public health department said in its news release.\\nWhile there are no specific medicines used to treat dengue, there are some 'supportive medicines to help with fever and pain,' the public health department said.\\nOne type of dengue vaccine is available for use in areas with risk of dengue in the United States\\nThere is one vaccine available for use in areas with risk of dengue in the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. But the CDC notes specific recommendations for who should and should not receive a dengue vaccine.\\nThe Los Angeles County Department of Public Health recommends the following precautions:\\nThe public health department is working with the Greater Los Angeles County Vector Control District to visit residents in the neighborhood where cases have been reported. There, representatives let residents know how they can protect themselves.\\nThe Greater Los Angeles County Vector Control District has also upped its mosquito trapping to reduce the chance of dengue fever spreading.\\nThose with questions can call a nearby clinic or doctor or the Public Health InfoLine at 1-833-540-0473. The line is open daily from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"GREEN BAY – Four games into the season, new Green Bay Packers defensive coordinator Jeff Hafley has a lot more information about his players than he did a month ago.\\nAmong the lessons is that the Packers' pass rush along the front four isn't as disruptive as he'd projected going into the season or as good as it looked sacking the Tennessee Titans' struggling second-year quarterback Will Levis eight times last week. Going forward, Hafley probably will have to be quicker working in blitzes and unexpected combinations of four-man rushes than he was against the Minnesota Vikings.\\nHafley stuck almost exclusively with a conventional four-man rush in the first half and got minimal pressure as Sam Darnold carved up his defense while putting up touchdowns on four of the Vikings' first five possessions.\\nOn 19 first-half pass calls (including three wiped out by penalty and a Darnold scramble), Hafley called 15 conventional four-man rushes and blitzed only four times, really three because one was a pass from the 2-yard line and Hafley had five defensive linemen on the field.\\nThe Packers rarely got pressure on Darnold, and he finished the half with a 140.6 rating (11-for-15, 136 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions). On one of the only plays in the first half the Packers pressured Darnold, a standard four-man rush, Lukas Van Ness ran a stunt, chased him out of the pocket and induced Darnold into a bad decision: An across-the-body-throw on the move that linebacker Isaiah McDuffie dropped for what would have been a big interception on the game's first series.\\nIn the second half, Hafley didn't go particularly blitz heavy, but he mixed in some fake Double-A-gap blitzes, along with rushes where he sent a cornerback or linebacker and dropped a defensive lineman in coverage. On one of the latter, linebacker Quay Walker sacked Darnold, and on another cornerback Keisean Nixon had a big strip sack the Packers recovered.\\nThis isn't to suggest the solution to the Packers' pass-rush issues is to go blitz crazy. Blitzing carries its own set of risks for getting gashed in coverage if you don't get home.\\nFilm review:Packers need Jordan Love to be a playmaker, but they don't need him to be a hero\\nPete Dougherty:Rusty Packers quarterback Jordan Love no match for Vikings defensive coordinator Brian Flores' scheme\\nBut Walker is improved as a blitzer and Nixon has shown explosiveness off the edge. Also, rookie linebacker Edgerrin Cooper looks especially explosive as a blitzer — that was one of the reasons for drafting him in the second round — and could become a threat offenses have to plan around with a bump in his playing time.\",\n",

While prosecutors asserted that Lyle, then 21, and Erik, then 18, slaughtered José and Kitty Menendez at their home for the couple\\'s $14 million fortune, Erik and Lyle claim their father abused them physically, sexually and emotionally. Erik fought back while testifying to dad\\'s abuse, which he said began when he was 6 and lasted until the time of the murders.\\nMurphy\\'s series, which presents a dramatized version of the events that unfolded, invited a lot of controversy and criticism, including from Erik Menendez, who in a statement issued through his wife Tammie Menendez, slammed the show for its \"horrible and blatant lies\" and \"vile and appalling character portrayals of Lyle and of me.\"\\nMeanwhile, Cooper Koch, the actor who portrays Erik in the series, met his real-life acting subject during an in-person prison visit last week led by Kim Kardashian, Koch told The Hollywood Reporter. While Erik had not seen the new Netflix series yet, he praised Koch for his work, the actor told THR. Kardashian, who has evolved into a leading voice on criminal justice reform, meanwhile is rallying for the release of the two brothers.\\nLos Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón in a press conference Thursday announced his office would review new evidence in the brothers\\' case, including a letter sent by one of the brothers to a family member alleging he was the victim of molestation.\\nPresecutors: Evidence of alleged sexual abuse to be reviewed in Menendez brothers case\\nA group of the Menendez brothers\\' family members also criticized the show as a \"phobic, gross, anachronistic, serial episodic nightmare that is not only riddled with mistruths and outright falsehoods but ignores the most recent exculpatory revelations.\"\\nMurphy, meanwhile, in interviews with Entertainment Tonight and The Hollywood Reporter, defended the show, saying his intent was to include multiple perspectives on what happened. He also went on to say that the Menendez brothers should be sending him flowers for all the attention they\\'ve been getting because of the show.\\nLess than a month after the nine-episode series dropped and dominated Netflix\\'s Top 10 queue, a new documentary film featuring recorded phone calls of the brothers with director Alejandro Hartmann from the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego, where the pair are serving life sentences, is releasing on the streaming platform.\\n\"For the first time in 30 years, and in their own words, both brothers revisit the trial that shocked the nation,\" Netflix says about the upcoming film. \"Through extensive audio interviews with Lyle and Erik, lawyers involved in the trial, journalists who covered it, jurors, family, and other informed observers, acclaimed Argentinian director Alejandro Hartmann offers new insight and a fresh perspective on a case that people only think they know.\"\\nHere\\'s everything you need to know about the new documentary film spotlighting Erik and Lyle Menendez.\\nDid Lyle Menendez wear a hair piece? Why it came up in pivotal scene of Netflix\\'s new \\'Monsters\\' series\\n\"The Menendez Brothers\" will release on Monday, Oct. 7 at 3:00 a.m. ET.\\n\"The Menendez Brothers\" documentary film will be available to stream on Netflix.\\nThe film, directed by Hartmann, will feature interviews with both Erik and Lyle Menendez as well as new interviews with their cousin Diane Vander Molen and prosecutor Pamela Bozanich, as per Netflix.\\nNeed a break?

It\\'s your time. Yours, right now.\"\\nSeven years later, Rodgers continues to be Jones\\' biggest fan.\\nJones and Rodgers are no longer wearing green and gold but their appreciation for each other remains. And they\\'ll meet as opponents for the first time when Rodgers\\' New York Jets play Jones\\' Minnesota Vikings on Sunday in London.\\n\"Aaron Jones: Jonesy, is one of my all-time favorite teammates,\" Rodgers said Tuesday during his weekly appearance on \"The Pat McAfee Show.\" \"There\\'s nobody like Jonesy. He is a special human, one of the best guys to be in the locker room, one of the best guys to be in the shotgun with, smart as can be, tough, physical, a slasher, great hands, just always a positive attitude.\"\\nRodgers sets a high standard and it can be tough to break through for a young player. You make a mental mistake it can be tough to regain that trust. Jones had the trust with Rodgers immediately.\\nJones gave an example of how later in that 2017 season as he was on the sideline and relegated to a backup role Rodgers called for the coaches to put him in.\\n\\'Out of nowhere, A-Rod calls timeout,\" Jones recalled in The Players Tribune. \"Turns to the sideline and yells: \\'I want 33 in the game!!! I want 33 in the game!!! 33!! Now!!!\\'\\n\"I don\\'t even remember what the play was, or what happened on it, but I just know how good that felt. It was the reminder that I was there for a reason, you know what I mean? One of the best QBs who\\'s ever lived is actually seeing something in me.\\'\\nThere was a reason for that, Rodgers said. Jones had impeccable practice habits.\\n\"He was so professional, always prepared,\" Rodgers said Tuesday. \"The way he practiced, too. Ryan Grant practiced the right way. Jordy Nelson practiced the right way. Davante Adams practiced the right way. Aaron Jones practiced the right way. You take pride in your performance every single time. He\\'s a special, special human being.\"\\nJones is a \"glue guy,\" Rodgers said, and those type of players can change the culture of an organization.\\n\"There\\'s a few of these glue guys and when your glue guys are your best players that\\'s when you have a chance to do something special,\" Rodgers said.\\nThat\\'s Aaron Jones.\\nJones\\' 321 rushing yards are in the top 10 through his first four games of the season and he has the burst that he showed in his seven years in Green Bay. He\\'s averaging 5.0 yards per carry.\\nHe displayed his versatility against the Packers last week in the Vikings\\' 32-29 win. Jones rushed for 93 yards on 22 carries and also added four receptions for 46 yards. Jones was the ultimate all-purpose back and despite not scoring a touchdown he still did a Lambeau Leap after the game.\\nWhile Jones battled injuries early last year before returning with a vengeance as the Packers made their playoff run, the Packers moved on from him after signing Josh Jacobs to be the lead back. Jones turns 30 in December.\\n\"There might have been some thought that he didn\\'t have a whole lot left in the tank,\" Rodgers said. \"As we\\'ve seen through three or four weeks, that\\'s incorrect.\"\\nJones was a beloved player during his time in Green Bay for his contributions on and off the field. Rodgers said all of that never went unnoticed.\\n\"Aaron Jones is, I say this about a few guys, I said this about (John) Kuhn, (former Packers fullback) once, he epitomized what it meant to be a Packer,\" Rodgers said. \"Great in the community, phenomenal teammate, pride in his performance, pride in wearing those colors.',\n",

The Green Bay Packers home came in second on the list, right behind Lumen Field, home of the Seattle Seahawks.\\nFor Nancy Armour, a columnist for USA Today Sports, praised Lambeau for having \"all the amenities required in 2024.\" She also said what makes Lambeau so unique is the surrounding area it resides in.\\n\"For those not fortunate enough to have been there, it\\'s set in the middle of a neighborhood. There are people for whom Lambeau is their backyard,\" she said. \"It\\'s the perfect blend of quaint, old-word charm and modern glitz, and there is nothing else in the NFL like it.\\'\\nIt helps that there is a lot of winning for the home team, as the Packers hold a record of 276-137-6 at Lambeau, the best home record for any NFL in its teams history.\\nAs far as the fellow NFC North home venues, the Minnesota Vikings home turf, U.S. Bank Stadium, was ranked third on the list. Ford Field, home of the Detroit Lions, was ranked 16th. Soldier Field, home of the Chicago Bears, rounded out the NFC North with a 22nd place ranking.\\nDespite the high praise Lambeau gets, as well as the 2025 NFL draft being hosted in Green Bay, the Packers are still one of few teams who have yet to host a Super Bowl. And due to the requirements by the NFL, it doesn\\'t look like that will happen anytime soon.\\nWhat is now Lambeau Field opened in 1957 as City Stadium before being renamed in 1965.\\nMore:10 reasons Green Bay will never host a Super Bowl',\n",

       "   'excerpt': 'The Milwaukee Brewers face the Mets in a winner-take-all battle for the seventh time in franchise history. The others have been mostly thrillers.',\n",
       "   'summary': 'Before Thursday, the Milwaukee Brewers have played six winner-take-all postseason games — that is, games where the winner advances (or wins a World Series), while the loser\\'s season is over.\\nMilwaukee has two wins in those situations, and nearly every single occasion has been tight.\\nHere\\'s how the first six in Brewers lore went:\\nThe strike-split 1981 season created a strange postseason format, one that we consider somewhat common now, and it allowed the Brewers to make their first playoff appearance. The American League East second-half champion Brewers fell behind the first-half champion New York Yankees, 2-0, then rallied back for two wins at Yankee Stadium to force a decisive Game 5.\\nCecil Cooper\\'s two-out single in the seventh — he\\'d have another one of those in a different game on this list — scored Robin Yount to pull Milwaukee within 4-3, but Rick Cerone\\'s two-run homer in the bottom half replenished New York\\'s lead. Then came the cruelest development — with two runners on in the eighth against Goose Gossage, Don Money hit a long fly ball to left field that looked like it might be a go-ahead homer.\\nBut it fell safely in Dave Winfield\\'s glove for the final out. New York tacked on two insurance runs in their eighth, and the Brewers went 1-2-3 in the ninth. The Yankees went on to lose the World Series to the Los Angeles Dodgers in six games.\\nYou know about this one.\\nOne of the great moments in Wisconsin sports history came in the seventh, when Cooper\\'s two-out single scored two runs and turned a 3-2 deficit into a 4-3 lead. The Brewers held on from there, with Pete Ladd getting the final out against Hall of Famer Rod Carew that sent the Brewers to their first and only World Series.\\nLike in 1981, the Brewers went down in the series, 2-0, and battled back to tie, but this time at home. And in the final game, Milwaukee came through.\\nThe Brewers, of course, went on to lose to the St. Louis Cardinals in the World Series.\\nSince it was a regular-season game, we\\'re not counting Milwaukee\\'s finale against the Baltimore Orioles, in which the winner went to the playoffs and the loser stayed home, but it was essentially a playoff battle in its own right.\\nThe Brewers took a 3-1 lead on Paul Molitor\\'s single and Cooper\\'s sacrifice fly in the sixth, but everyone knows how the story ends. Keith Hernandez and George Hendrick drove in three runs over back-to-back plate appearances to give St. Louis a 4-3 edge, and the Cardinals added insurance runs in the eighth to pull away for the World Series championship. Darrell Porter, who first arrived in the big leagues as a Brewer, had one of the latter hits on his way to being maned the World Series MVP.\\nNyjer Morgan, the colorful outfield acquisition whose alter ego, \"Tony Plush,\" helped make him a Milwaukee phenomenon, had been acquired shortly before the start of the season from Washington. It\\'s a deal that lives forever now. His single back up the middle in the 10th inning against J.J. Putz allowed Carlos Gomez to score from second with the winning run in a walk-off victory to win the series and send the Brewers to the NLCS against St. Louis.\\nOn the cusp of their first World Series since 1982, the Brewers got an early 1-0 lead on a home run from Christian Yelich, but Cody Bellinger quickly answered in the top of the second to give the Dodgers a 2-1 lead. And that was it, essentially. Yasiel Puig hit a three-run homer to center in the sixth to remove some of the drama, and the Brewers were limited to one run on seven hits.\\nThe Dodgers went on to fall to the Boston Red Sox in the World Series, four games to one.\\nBefore the current playoff format, there was only one wild-card series per league, featuring a one-game playoff, and Milwaukee found itself in good position by taking a 3-0 lead on the host Nationals. It was 3-1 in the eighth with Brewers bullpen ace Josh Hader on the mound ... and disaster struck.',\n",

       "   'excerpt': \"Born in Northern Wisconsin, schooled in Green Bay, Charles Whittlesey went on to command World War I's Lost Battalion. This book tells his story.\",\n",
       "   'summary': 'Born in the small town of Florence in northeastern Wisconsin, Charles Whittlesey was a Medal of Honor recipient lauded for his leadership and bravery in battle during World War I.\\nNow the commander of the famed Lost Battalion is remembered for his valor in a graphic novel titled \"Medal of Honor: Charles Whittlesey.\" The novel is produced by the Association of the United States Army, a nonprofit organization that supports soldiers, their families and Army civilians.\\nThe Whittlesey book tracks his life, including his early start in Wisconsin, his East Coast education and his unusual and distinguished military career which led to him receiving America\\'s highest military honor. It also covers his tragic death by suicide, haunted by his experiences in the war.\\nThe Whittlesey book, produced by a team of historians, graphic novel artists and writers, is part of an AUSA series of graphic novels about Medal of Honor recipients. The series began in 2018 with a profile of another World War I veteran, Alvin York. So far, 24 issues have been created, and the Whittlesey book is one of four released this year. The others released in 2024 are about Ruben Rivers, a Black tank commander who fought with the \"Black Panthers\" in World War II; Flo Groberg, the first foreign-born Medal of Honor recipient since the Vietnam War; and Hiroshi Miyamura, a Korean War veteran whose award was classified as top secret.\\nWhittlesey was born in January of 1884, the oldest of four sons of Frank and Annie Whittlesey. Frank Whittlesey was engaged in the logging industry at the time. When Charles Whittlesey was old enough, he was sent to live with an aunt to go to elementary school, according to an article that ran in the Nov. 30, 1921, Green Bay Press-Gazette.\\nWhittlesey \"was a quiet fellow,\" one of his classmates, Fred C. Tooker, told the newspaper, but also \"very bright.\" He was still a boy when he and his family moved to Pittsfield, Massachusetts, where his father went to work for the General Electric Co., first as a purchasing agent, later as a production manager.\\nTall and bespectacled, Whittlesey went to Williams College in Williamstown, Massachusetts. He again impressed classmates with his intellect, according to a biography the college has posted on its website. Whittlesey was nicknamed \"The Count\" by fellow students, according to the graphic novel, \"because of his serious, aristocratic nature.\"\\nAfter college, he went to Harvard Law School.\\nWhittlesey was 33 years old and practicing law in New York City when the United States entered World War I. He soon volunteered for military service, and was shipped in May 1917 to France as a captain in the 308th Infantry, 77th Division.\\nBy September 1918, Whittlesey was a major and in command of the 1st Battalion of the 308th Infantry. The battalion attacked German forces as part of a larger campaign in the Meuse-Argonne region of France. According to the graphic novel, the plan was for Whittlesey and his 500 soldiers to link with units on the battalion\\'s right and left flanks, then move ahead.\\nThe forces did not meet as planned, and Whittlesey was ordered to advance without any support on his flanks. The battalion moved forward and created what would be called \"the pocket.\" German forces would surround them and lay a bloody siege down on the battalion. Whittlesey and his men knew where they were, they were \"lost\" in terms of getting supplies, outside communication and help.\\nAgainst all odds the men of the battalion fought off German attacks. Eventually friendly forces broke through, but holding out \"came at a heavy cost,\" the graphic novel says. \"Of the 554 men who followed Whittlesey into the pocket, only 194 were able to walk away.\"\\nThe battle brought fame to both the battalion and Whittlesey, and is the subject of books and movies including \"The Lost Battalion\" with Ricky Schroder, who portrayed Whittlesey in a 2001 TV movie.\\nAccording to a blog post on the Arlington National Cemetery website, Army investigations showed that Whittlesey\\'s leadership, perseverance and valor in the pocket \"prevented even more casualties.\" The Army awarded him the Medal of Honor and promoted him to lieutenant colonel. \"He returned to the United States as a war hero. However, the introverted young officer appeared deeply uncomfortable with his fame,\" according to the blog post.\\nHe did not talk about his experiences during the war. Instead, \"he focused on honoring enlisted men and advocating for peace,\" the blog post said. \"In all likelihood, Whittlesey probably suffered from what would now be diagnosed as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). He was, according to friends, haunted by nightmares and memories of the soldiers who had died under his command.\"\\nOn Nov. 11, 1921, Whittlesey participated in the funeral of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery. He died days later on Nov. 26, 1921, while traveling by ship to Havana, Cuba, from New York.\\nThe book is free online. Readers can read the work, or download it at www.ausa.org/whittlesey.',\n",

       "   'excerpt': \"Trump's running mate delivered a more coherent, disciplined version of Trump's message than Trump did in his debate.\",\n",
       "   'summary': 'WASHINGTON - Forget about asking whether Tim Walz or JD Vance won the vice-presidential debateTuesday night.\\nThe real question: How did Kamala Harris and Donald Trump fare in it?\\nThat\\'s because Americans vote for the top of the ticket, whether the bottom of the ticket is a formidable figure (Al Gore, Paul Ryan) or a flawed one (think Sarah Palin). By that measure, the 90-minute encounter on CBS was better for Trump, whose running mate delivered a more coherent version of Trump\\'s message than Trump himself managed to do at the presidential debate last month.\\n\"I know that a lot of you are worried about chaos in the world and the feeling that the American dream is unattainable,\" Vance said near the start, saying the world was calmer and the economy better during Trump\\'s presidency and blaming Harris for today\\'s turmoil. He avoided rabbit holes and personal insults.\\n\"Who has been the vice president for the last three-and-a-half years?\" Vance declared to Walz. \"The answer is your running mate, not mine.\"\\nFor his part, Walz stumbled a bit on foreign policy at the start, and he was a less confident and fluent speaker than Vance throughout the evening. Vance deliberately projected a more moderate mien than he has in the past, and Walz seemed to struggle to hold Vance accountable for his record and Trump\\'s.\\nIn the debate\\'s final question, Walz did find his footing after Vance sidestepped questions about Trump\\'s refusal to accept the results of the last election, leading to the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol. \"Did he lose the 2020 election?\" Walz pressed. When Vance dodged the issue again, Walz called it \"a damning non-answer\" and described Trump as \"a threat to our democracy in a way that we have not seen\" before.\\nThat said, the evening\\'s impact on their standings, for better or worse, is politically irrelevant to the contest for the White House. Vance\\'s favorable rating, which has been low, and Walz\\' affability quotient, which has been high, aren\\'t likely to move the needle in the contest that is essentially tied. The undercard debate never has, not even when a vice-presidential contender clearly prevailed.\\nNever.\\nIn a sign of the stakes that matter, Vance spent more of his fire targeting Harris as a far-left ideologue than he did Walz − despite the Minnesota governor\\'s liberal record, ripe with targets. Walz focused on Trump\\'s record as president and his rhetoric during the campaign and since.\\nNow a margin-of-error race is hurtling into its final five weeks. Nonpartisan polls nationwide and in seven battleground states show what is by some measures the closest contest in modern times. The RealClearPolitics.com average of recent surveys puts Trump up by a point or two in four of those states (Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania) and Harris up by a point or two in the other three (Michigan, Nevada, Wisconsin).\\nThere were moments that illuminated the hurdles ahead for Harris and Trump over the next 34 days.\\nWhile tens of millions of people were watching, a prime audience being targeted by both candidates was a narrow one.\\nThat would be white, working-class voters in the upper Midwest, once part of the Democratic coalition and now a key element in Trump\\'s base. A sweep of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin would simplify Harris\\' calculus to amass the 270 electoral votes she needs to win. A loss, especially of vote-rich Pennsylvania, would make her path more perilous.\\nBoth candidates managed to mention that they were from the neighborhood, Vance from Ohio and Walz from Minnesota by way of Nebraska. Vance discussed more than once being raised by his grandmother in hardscrabble poverty. Walz recalled riding his bike until dark in the small town where he was reared. \"I\\'m a hunter,\" he mentioned in passing in response to a question about gun violence.\\nActually, the biggest potential impact of Tuesday\\'s debate just might be this: If it prompted Trump to change his mind about debating Harris again, to decide that he didn\\'t want his running mate delivering the last word on the biggest stage available during a campaign. Harris already has accepted, and Trump declined, a CNN invitation to debate on Oct. 23.\\nAnother debate between Trump and Harris before Election Day?',\n",

       "   'summary': \"Former President Donald Trump wasted his debate last month with Vice President Kamala Harris.\\nThat was Trump's opportunity to call out her numerous (and significant) flip-flops in front of a national audience – and more importantly to tie Harris to the failed economic and immigration policies of the current administration.\\nThe only scheduled vice presidential debate Tuesday between GOP Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz was likely the last chance the two sides will have before the Nov. 5 election to make their case on this type of widely viewed platform, since Trump has said he won't meet Harris for another debate.\\nVance stepped in to make up for what Trump didn't do. He kept the heat on Harris and the fact she's an integral part of the Biden-Harris administration.\\nVance also surpassed my expectations. He came across as confident, relatable and well-versed on the issues, while Walz often appeared nervous and unsure of himself.\\nWho won the debate?Vote in our Opinion poll.\\nFor months, voters have said that high prices and spiking illegal immigration are their top concerns.\\nAnd many Americans blame President Joe Biden and Harris as the occupants of the White House the past four years. Border encounters surged during the Biden-Harris administration, and Harris' appointment as border czar early in her tenure as vice president proved an epic failure.\\nThankfully, Walz and Vance kept the discussion on immigration away from the 'eating pets' nonsense that Trump brought up at last month's debate −and which Vance has propagated on the campaign trail.\\nOn the economy, Walz tried to defend Harris' big-government plans for housing, child care and other spending priorities that would add billions to the deficit – and do nothing to combat high costs.\\nVance smartly brought the conversation back to how Harris has been in the White House and has failed to address inflation, and he reminded people about how, until the pandemic, the economy was strong under Trump.\\nOpinion:Kamala Harris seems 'unburdened' by her lackluster past. She can thank the media for that.\\nHarris has tried mightily to distance herself from the inconvenient aspects of the Biden-Harris record, but it's hard when Biden says things like he did last week on 'The View':\\n'As vice president, there wasn't a single thing that I did that she couldn't do, and so I was able to delegate her responsibility on everything from foreign policy to domestic policy.'\\nVance kept reminding voters about that, too.\\nRegardless of who you may think won Tuesday, does it actually matter?\\nI have my doubts.\\nThe presidential race remains extremely close, and most voters have made up their minds at this point. Early voting has already started in several states.\\nOpinion:Republicans for Kamala Harris? A true conservative couldn't vote for her.\\nIn Michigan, considered one of the states that could decide the election, a recent USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll found Harris has a small lead (48% to 45%) over Trump, within the margin of error.\\nThe survey also found that most people – 93% – have firmly made up their minds about who will get their vote. Only 5% said it's possible they could change their mind.\\n'I don't believe there are any genuinely undecided voters at this point,' Republican strategist Dennis Lennox told me ahead of the debate. 'If you haven't made your mind up by now you won't be persuaded and won't show up to vote. This is a turnout election.'\\nDavid Dulio, distinguished professor of political science at Michigan's Oakland University, also doesn't think the VP debate will make much of a difference. He said that since Harris got in the race, the polling has been 'incredibly stable,' including after Trump's lackluster performance in his debate with Harris.\\nThat doesn't mean Tuesday's debate was meaningless, though.\\nIt's the job of the running mates to make voters feel more comfortable voting for the candidate at the top, Dulio told me.\\n'Think of it as reinforcing a choice rather than tilting a choice,' he said.\\nUnder that standard, Vance succeeded in giving more of a boost to Trump than Walz did for Harris.\",\n",

       "   'excerpt': 'Quintana has a 2.98 career ERA against the Brewers in 23 games.',\n",
       "   'summary': 'In the pantheon of \"Brewers killers,\" Jose Quintana\\'s name surfaces often.\\nThe left-hander has had plenty of experience against the Milwaukee Brewers in his career all over the National League Central — he\\'s pitched for the Chicago Cubs, St. Louis Cardinals and Pittsburgh Pirates.\\nHe\\'ll get the ball for the New York Mets in a true winner-take-all game Thursday, the Brewers\\' first such postseason game since the 2019 wild-card game in Washington.\\nQuintana\\'s 2.98 career ERA against the Brewers in 23 games (22 starts) is pretty strong, though not his best mark against any team. He also hasn\\'t had a victory against the Brewers since 2019, going 0-3. That includes an 0-2 mark this season, with the Brewers getting to Quintana for two wins over the Mets in the regular-season series at the beginning and end of the year.\\nQuintana had a 3.77 ERA, allowing six earned runs in just more than 14 innings, in three games against Milwaukee last year. He had a relief inning against Milwaukee in 2021 and had a gaudy 5.81 ERA against the Brewers in 2019, when he game up seven homers and 20 runs in 31 innings.\\nBefore that, yes, Quintana was elite against Milwaukee. The 35-year-old has been solid this season for the Mets, with a 3.75 ERA in 170 innings, his highest workload since 2019.\\nMore:Brewers have a $10 ticket deal for decisive Game 3 playoff matchup against the Mets\\nWhen the Mets signed Quintana to a two-year deal in late 2022, he was joining a very different rotation than the one that came to American Family Field for the playoffs. The Mets had Justin Verlander, Max Scherzer and Carlos Carrasco, and they were on the cusp of signing Kodai Senga, who had a tremendous rookie season but has been sidelined by injury most of this year.\\nVerlander and Scherzer were traded during a disappointing 2023 season, while Carrasco was placed on waivers and ultimately parted ways with the Mets after the season. With Senga out, Quintana wound up with the start on opening day this season against the Brewers. The game became known for a dust-up between the teams and, at least in retrospect, the big-league debut for Jackson Chourio, whose fifth-inning single against Quintana was his first big-league hit.\\nThe Brewers won that game, 3-1. In what Milwaukee hopes is a blueprint for Thursday, the Brewers got the best of Quintana and the Mets on the final Saturday of the season, 6-0. In that game, Jared Koenig served as the \"opener,\" Thursday starter Tobias Myers worked four clean innings, and Milwaukee\\'s A-list bullpen took it from there. Quintana was on the hook for two earned runs in 4⅓ innings.\\nQuintana has never faced the Brewers in the playoffs but did have a staggering seven starts against Milwaukee in the 2018 season when Milwaukee reached the seventh game of the National League Championship Series, and the Cubs went 5-2 in those games.\\nMore:Nickel: In a world of his own, the Brewers\\' Jackson Chourio makes history with two home runs\\nMore:Inside the inning that may have saved playoff baseball in Milwaukee for 2024',\n",

Winds will be lighter than earlier this week, but it\\'ll still be breezy. Highs in the low 70s will continue for the rest of the week, with no chances for rain until the Saturday overnight hours.\\nThe latest Marquette University Law School poll released yesterday still shows Vice President Kamala Harris with a four-point lead over former President Donald Trump in Wisconsin, representing no changes from a month ago and still within the margin for error. Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin leads Republican challenger Eric Hovde by seven points.\\nThe poll showed interesting developments among independent voters, who are now trending more in Harris\\' direction and are expressing more enthusiasm about voting in November. The poll also found that nearly half of Wisconsinites have stopped talking about politics with someone, a nearly 10-point increase from 2012, when political divisions were high during Act 10, which limited collective bargaining for most public workers.\\nWe\\'re in the middle of a busy campaign week for both candidates. Harris will hold a rally in Ripon today, while Trump returns on Sunday for a rally in Juneau, his fourth event in Wisconsin in just nine days.\\nRemember the sinkhole that formed in Whitefish Bay in June, after 90-year-old storm sewer infrastructure failed? The village board has approved a $5.5 million contract to repair it, which Village President Kevin Buckley said is one of the most expensive projects undertaken in the village\\'s history.\\n\"Although we\\'re in an urgent situation where the village has declared a state of emergency, we still are doing our due diligence, working alongside the contractor to be very conscientious of quality control, contractor price and timeline,\" Director of Public Works Matt Collins said.\\nSince the sinkhole was discovered, 500 feet of temporary outfall piping has been installed that snakes from the collapsed pipe down to Lake Michigan and reduces flooding risks, Collins said. Crews have also installed sensors to monitor flood risk during heavy rainfall, which will enable them to pump stormwater into bypass locations.\\nHope Karnopp can be reached at HKarnopp@gannett.com or on Twitter at @hopekarnopp.\\nDid someone share this newsletter with you?

       "   'summary': 'I didn\\'t like Donald Trump\\'s choice for vice president when I first saw that he had chosen Ohio Sen. JD Vance.\\nIn July, during the Republican National Convention, I posted on X that Vance was an \"awful pick for VP,\" who wouldn\\'t reach voters who were unsure about Trump. I thought he\\'d come across as too zealous.\\nBoy, was I wrong. And I\\'ve never been happier to be wrong.\\nAfter Tuesday night\\'s debate against Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz, all I could think was, forget Trump: I want Vance and his vision for America.\\nVoters should too.\\nUsually vice presidential debates are a yawn-fest. Nobody pays them much mind. But not this time.\\nThanks to how poorly both Trump and Kamala Harris did during their last debate, the bar to exceed expectations was low. Vance greatly surpassed what I expected of him. Heck, even Walz did too, though Vance was the clear winner.\\nKind, substantive, but at times lethal with his responses, Vance cut through Walz\\'s rhetoric. With empathy, he often admitted that the problems moderators presented were nuanced, that his opponent likely agreed with him on that basis, but their solutions were different.\\nOpinion poll: Who won the vice president debate? We want to hear from you.\\nWhether it was about the economy, immigration or even school shootings and gun control, both candidates seemed thoughtful, calm and interested more in an actual policy debate than name-calling, flip-flopping or obfuscating (with a couple exceptions). Because of the awful rhetoric we\\'ve heard from Trump since 2015, calm and thoughtful was stunning, but welcome.\\nMaybe it was the poverty-stricken Appalachian kid in him who\\'s been fighting to survive since he was young or the Yale University law graduate who\\'s mastered the art of persuasion, but the Vance we saw Tuesday night was the way all political debates should go.\\nVance\\'s kindness and empathy were noticeable and a huge departure from Walz, Harris and Trump. Americans should feel calmness, relief and decisive strength from their political leaders. Vance embodied those characteristics.\\nThis is the debate Americans deserved to understand the choices ahead of them. It\\'s the first debate in years where I\\'ve had real hope for America, thanks to the candidates\\' demeanor.\\nVance\\'s attitude wasn\\'t his only strength. On most issues, he painted a picture of Americans even Democrats should love.\\nUnlike Harris, Walz or Trump, Vance had no trouble explaining his views in a way any American could understand. Vance has been traversing the country not just holding rallies but talking off the cuff to reporters and often fielding hostile questions. Thus, Vance presented clear, direct responses on complicated issues, like securing the border or fixing immigration. Walz has been walled off, living in a Democratic-sealed cocoon, and it showed.\\nVance\\'s answer on censorship and Big Tech was excellent. \"I believe we actually do have a threat to democracy in this country, but unfortunately it\\'s not the threat to democracy that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz want to talk about,\" Vance said. \"It is the threat of censorship. It\\'s Americans casting aside lifelong friendships because of disagreements about politics. It\\'s big technology companies silencing their fellow citizens, and it\\'s Kamala Harris saying that rather than debate and persuade her fellow Americans, she\\'d like to censor people who engage in misinformation.\"\\nOpinion newsletter: Sign up for our newsletter on conservative values, family and religion from columnist Nicole Russell. Get it delievered to your inbox.\\nAs a working mom, I appreciated Vance\\'s thoughtful answer on paid family leave. I don\\'t think it should be federally mandated for all employers − we should incentivize companies to offer paid live to meet high employee demand − but Vance emphasized that women want choices in the workplace. Some mothers want different things than others. The fact that he mentioned choice demonstrates he\\'s experienced as a father and husband.\\nVance reminded viewers that the economy under Trump was stronger − something that seems obvious to anyone with a wallet. And as wars rage around us, Vance reminded Americans that under Trump, we saw relative peace.\\nVance\\'s strongest talking point was to simply remind Americans that Harris has had nearly four years to implement the ideas she now promotes as new. \"[Harris] has been the vice president for three-and-a-half years. Day one was 1,400 days ago, and her policies have made these problems worse,\" Vance said in his closing statement.\\nOpinion: Harris claims she\\'s for the middle class. Where\\'s she been for the past 4 years?\\nVance did have one flaw, and it was significant.\\nHe refused to condemn Trump for his actions on Jan. 6, 2021, and for the former president\\'s refusal to admit that he lost the election in 2020.\\nIt was the only time of the night that he seemed to hedge on the truth. He knew he had to trying defending Trump\\'s actions, but they are indefensible. Vance tried to walk the tight rope of deferring to his running mate while vowing that democracy is paramount. He didn\\'t succeed.\\nWalz is a much better debater than Harris. But like Harris, he seemed to have only two modes: Be dishonest or present unsavory policies.\\nWhen asked why he claimed he was in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square protests, Walz mentioned growing up in a small town, joining the military and learning a lot. He obfuscated and said he was a \"knucklehead.\" When the moderator asked again, Walz appeared uncomfortable and couldn\\'t give a straight answer.\\nThough Walz admitted to being a hunter and pro-Second Amendment, when it came to school shootings, he blamed guns rather than criminals. He said he\\'d become friends with school shooters. He obviously misspoke, but the rest of his answer didn\\'t provide any real solutions to resolve violence at schools.\\nWalz is a progressive leftist rivaling the likes of California Gov. Gavin Newsom. Don\\'t let his Midwestern image fool you.\\nBy contrast, in Vance\\'s America, working women are respected, the sanctity of life is emphasized, taxes are low and the border is secure.\\nIn Vance\\'s America, disagreement is inevitable but so are kindness and empathy. In Vance\\'s America, it\\'s us against the world, not a civil war on our own soil or even on the debate stage.\\nTuesday\\'s debate gives me hope that there is a path forward that does not include name-calling or flip-flopping on hard issues.\\nIf only the Republican ticket were reversed.\\nNicole Russell is an opinion columnist with USA TODAY.

Tim Walz take the debate stage, the Democrats released a new digital ad positioning Vance as \"a heartbeat away\" from the presidency if Republicans take the White House.\\nThe ad paints Vance as \"a danger to democracy\" and an \"extremist\" due to his stance on abortion and ties to the authors of Project 2025. It also points to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump\\'s age and legal issues posing a risk to his ability to serve another four-year term.\\n\"Debate night will be yet another reminder to voters about the stakes of this election, and a stark warning that a victory for Donald Trump could place Vance, America\\'s least favorite extremist, just a heartbeat away from the presidency,\\' Harris-Walz 2024 spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement, referring to the fact that a vice president is first in line to take over should anything happen to a sitting president.\\nThe Trump-Vance campaign did not immediately respond to USA TODAY\\'s request for comment.\\nDebate live updates:What time is vice presidential debate tonight? Channel, watch online\\nIn a recent ad by an anti-Trump group, the Lincoln Project, cowboy-esque actor Sam Elliott centered the growing gender issue in this election by encouraging voters to \"be a man and vote for a woman.\"\\nEven before President Joe Biden dropped out of the election, abortion access was a mobilizing issue among Democratic-leaning women. With Harris taking over as the nominee, America faces its second opportunity in a decade to elect the first female president in U.S. history.\\nTrump\\'s campaign has leaned into courting young male voters with appearances with influencers like Adin Ross, Logan Paul and Theo Von.\\nThe gender divide is likely to become a part of Tuesday\\'s vice presidential debate as well, as both vice presidential candidates display competing versions of the everyman. Vance has repeatedly come under scrutiny for his comments about \"childless cat ladies,\" while Walz, a supporter of reproductive rights, has played up the classic dad angle.\\nTune into the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate on Tuesday, Oct. 1, at 9 p.m. ET on CBS or simulcast on www.usatoday.com.',\n",

A ranking of how much hockey stars make\\nMore:Who's facing the most pressure in the NHL? Bruins, Jeremy Swayman at impasse\\nAs of Wednesday there were a substantial number of seats available via Ticketmaster and other secondary market sources.\\nRegular-season, 23-man rosters don't have to be set until opening night Tuesday, so exhibition games tend to involve young players fighting for spots in the NHL.\\nConnor Bedard lived up to the hype in his rookie season last year when he finished with 61 points (22 goals, 39 assists) in 68 games. He is just 19 years old.\\nChicago signed free-agent forwards Tyler Bertuzzi (21 goals, 22 assists last year with Toronto) and Teuvo Teravainen (25 goals, 28 assists with Carolina) to help take some pressure off Bedard and to improve an offense that was the least productive in the league last season (2.17 goals per game).\\nDefenseman Ryan Suter, a Madison native and onetime star at the University of Wisconsin now entering his 20th NHL season, signed with the Blues after spending the past three seasons with Dallas.\\nForward Jake Neighbours is a rising star, having moved from the fourth line to the first over the course of last season. He finished with 27 goals and 11 assists in 77 games.\\nAlthough both experienced offensive dips last season, forwards Jordan Kyrou (31 goals, 36 assists in '23-24) and Brayden Schenn (20 goals, 26 assists) remain among the team's top scorers.\\nThe 2022 exhibition game between the Blackhawks and Minnesota Wild was the 12th NHL game in Milwaukee. The most recent previously was in 1999, when the Nashville Predators and St. Louis played to a 2-2 tie at the Bradley enter.\\nJane and Lloyd Pettit helped pay for the construction of the Bradley Center in hopes of attracting an NHL team but then balked when hit with a $50 million expansion fee that included a payment to the Blackhawks due to the proximity.\\nPeter Feigen, president of the Bucks, said in 2022 that pursuing a team was not in the Bucks', arena's or NHL's plans, and Jaime Faulkner, president of operations for the Blackhawks, said she didn't expect that to happen.\\nFiserv Forum has hosted an annual four-game college showcase built around the Wisconsin Badgers over the holidays and will again this year.\",\n",

       "   'excerpt': \"While the veterans' bats have been largely silent, two young players came through in a win-or-go-home Game 2 at American Family Field.\",\n",
       "   'summary': 'And the youngsters shall lead them.\\nStanding six outs away from bowing out meekly yet again in the postseason, the Milwaukee Brewers got a game-tying home run by Jackson Chourio and go-ahead, two-run home run by Garrett Mitchell to blaze past the New York Mets, 5-3, Wednesday night in Game 2 of the National League wild-card series at American Family Field.\\nChourio\\'s homer was his second of the game; he led off the bottom of the first with an opposite-field shot off Mets starter Sean Manaea three pitches in.\\nGame 2 box score:Brewers 5, Mets 3\\nMitchell, meanwhile, had entered the game as a pinch-runner in the sixth. The at-bat was his first of the game and came after Willy Adames singled to left with two outs and the score tied at 3-3.\\nPhil Maton hung a first-pitch curveball and Mitchell hammered it out to right-center, electrifying the crowd while he gestured to fans while rounding the bases.\\nDevin Williams retired the Mets in order in the ninth, putting the finishing touches on the Brewers\\' six-game losing streak in the playoffs that dated to 2021.\\n\"I think it\\'s going to be a beautiful game out there,\" is what Chourio told reporters early Tuesday afternoon.\\nThen, three pitches into the bottom of the first, he smacked an 0-2 sinker left out over the plate by Manaea out to right to pull the Brewers even with the Mets at 1-1 and send the crowd of 40,350 into a frenzy.\\nIt was the second postseason leadoff homer in franchise history. Corey Hart led off Game 6 of the 2011 NLCS by going deep against the St. Louis Cardinals.\\nWhat an answer by the 20-year-old Chourio to his fifth-inning fielding gaffe in Game 1, a miscue that helped open the door to a game-turning, five-run rally by the Mets in an 8-4 loss.\\nThe first-inning homer was the second Manaea allowed the Brewers in five days. Rhys Hoskins slugged a grand slam against him last Friday.\\nThree batters after Chourio misplayed Tyrone Taylor\\'s fly ball into a double in Game 1, Joel Payamps failed to cover first base in a timely fashion on a ground ball by José Iglesias. That slight hesitation allowed Iglesias to slide head-first into the bag just ahead of Payamps touching it and shortly thereafter the dam burst.\\nA similarly bad mistake was made in the second inning in this one, only this time by Montas and on a ground ball to the right side by Starling Marte.\\nRhys Hoskins fielded the ball and made a perfect toss to Montas, who got to the bag in plenty of time but somehow failed to make the catch. Taylor and Francisco Alvarez followed with singles, and then Francisco Lindor hit a sacrifice fly to left to put New York back in front, 3-1.\\nIt\\'s the fourth postseason game Montas has appeared in during his nine-year career, and there probably haven\\'t been many easier plays than the one he failed to make.\\nFreddy Peralta allowed three second-inning runs in Game 1 but eventually found his groove and retired nine straight batters before being pulled by manager Pat Murphy with his pitch count at only 68.\\nThere\\'s certainly something to the \"third time through the order\" argument, but after seeing things immediately go south once Payamps entered only provided more fuel to the fire for fans who believed Murphy\\'s hook for Peralta was too quick.\\nMontas had retired six of seven batters, including the last two via strikeout, before being lifted by Murphy with a runner on second in the fourth and his pitch count at 60.\\nTrevor Megill entered and induced a flyout to keep it a 3-1 game and close the book on a six-hit, three-run (one earned), one-walk, three-strikeout start for Montas.\\nOne of the more intriguing storylines coming into the series was how the Brewers\\' core of young and inexperienced players would perform with the lights at their brightest.\\nAs it turned out, they did more than OK as Chourio shone, Brice Turang had multiple hits in each game and Sal Frelick exhibited tremendous toughness by playing through a painful left hip contusion and generating offense at the bottom of the lineup.\\nMilwaukee\\'s veterans, however, were a different story.\\nWilly Adames was 0 for 3 with a walk in Game 1 and 1 for 4 with a run scored in Game 2. William Contreras was 1 for 4 with two RBI in Game 1 and 1 for 4 in Game 2. And Rhys Hoskins was 0 for 3 with an RBI and a walk in Game 1 and 0 for 4 in Game 2.\\nNeedless to say, it\\'s tough to win any sort of game with such a glaring lack of production from your best and most consistent run producers, let alone in the postseason.\\nAnd right on cue, when the Brewers needed a lift and the air had been let out of the crowd of 40,350, Chourio delivered.\\nWith New York holding a 3-2 lead and only three outs away from being able to turn the game over to its closer Edwin Diaz, the rookie stepped to the plate against the right-hander Maton.\\nIn a 1-1 count, he got a cutter up and over the plate and again sent the ball out to right, this time hitting it off the facing of the second deck to tie it at 3-3.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'Former Milwaukee City Attorney Tearman Spencer was charged criminally on Wednesday with using his public position to gain a \"dishonest advantage\" in a dispute with another city department over a facility where his cars were stored.\\nSpencer, 67, of Milwaukee was accused in Milwaukee County Circuit Court of one count of misconduct in office, a felony, and one count of obstructing an officer, a misdemeanor, according to a 14-page criminal complaint.\\n\\'The investigation revealed that the defendant directed Milwaukee City Attorney staff and resources in an effort to have himself or another avoid fees and repairs required by Department of Neighborhood Services Inspections that totaled thousands of dollars and to avoid inspections regarding his personal property,\\' the complaint states.\\nIf convicted on both counts, Spencer could face more than four years in prison and fines of up to $20,000.\\nSpencer did not immediately respond to an email and voicemails seeking comment on the charges. When the news organization wrote about the dispute last year, he had left a voicemail on a reporter\\'s phone saying he was proud of his car collection.\\nHis lawyer, William Sulton, said in an email that Spencer \"denies and disputes that he committed any crime.\"\\n\"We do not believe that the alleged facts meet the legal sufficiency requirements for pleadings in our state,\" Sulton said. \"We will seek prompt dismissal of the charges.\"\\nThe Journal Sentinel first reported in November that when Milwaukee city inspectors had raised concerns about apparent unauthorized car repair work and other code violations at a poorly maintained north side building, they were given a letter on City Attorney\\'s Office letterhead that the owner contended exempted him from obtaining a required occupancy permit.\\nThe inspectors were also told that Spencer was keeping old cars at the building on North King Drive, the Journal Sentinel reported. He was not paying rent to store the vehicles there.\\nThe City Attorney\\'s Office is responsible for the legal representation of city departments and for providing them with legal guidance.\\nMore:Milwaukee city attorney\\'s apparent intervention in code dispute where his cars are stored raises concerns\\nOn the felony charge, the complaint states that between June 1, 2022, and Feb. 14, 2023, \"in his capacity as a public employee (Spencer) exercised a discretionary power in a manner inconsistent with the duties of his employment and with intent to obtain a dishonest advantage.\"\\nThe complaint says Spencer intervened on behalf of the building\\'s owner with city officials on several occasions.\\nIn 2021, Spencer personally called a city inspector about code violations and an annual fire inspection at the property and came to the inspection, prompting the inspector to say she would not conduct the inspection unless it was solely with the owner, according to an email from a top DNS official. She ultimately conducted only a partial inspection.\\nAnother inspector did an exterior review and found several violations, including the need for an occupancy permit. When the inspector arrived for a full inspection in October 2023, the owner told the inspector that the cars in the building belonged to the \"city attorney.\" The owner also showed the inspector a memo on City Attorney\\'s Office letterhead that said a building used for storing cars does not need an occupancy permit.\\nAccording to the complaint, Spencer had earlier written his top deputy, Odalo Ohiku, to \"have someone in your section answer whether or not this registration is required if this property is used as a storage facility for cars. And if not then what is if anything.\" An assistant city attorney then drafted the document, called \"vacant building car storage memo.\"\\nOhiku told an investigator that he did not know his boss had cars stored at the dilapidated building on North King Drive when Spencer requested the memo.\\nThe complaint said Spencer obtained the memo in the hopes that he and the building\\'s owner would \"gain the advantage of stopping the inspections, violations and fees associated with (Department of Neighborhood Services\\') work.\"\\nSpencer is also accused of obstructing an officer during an interview with police, the complaint states.\\nAccording to the complaint, Spencer and his attorney, who is not named, voluntarily met with an investigator for the District Attorney\\'s Office on July 21. Spencer told the investigator that he had \\'his people\\' at the City Attorney\\'s Office get involved in the issue because the matter involved his personal property.\\nIn the interview, Spencer said he bought the property at 3030 N. Martin Luther King Dr. in 2007 or 2008 through a company called Allmake Enterprises, a now-defunct limited liability company. He said an auto repair shop and car wash was operated out of the building when he owned it.\\nRecords show Allmake sold the property to Mohammed Ghaffer for $205,000 in March 2019.\\nDuring the interview, Spencer initially told the investigator that he had an agreement to \\'take care of the portion of the property he used.\\' He estimated that he stored 10 to 12 vehicles on the premises. But when asked later if there was any agreement on the upkeep of building, Spencer said, \\'No.\\'\\nThe complaint says this appears to be a contradiction.\\nSpencer was asked repeatedly about the \"vacant building car storage memo\" generated by his staff. He said, \\'I had my folks look into it to make sure that we were clear on what the statute is.\\'\\nAsked several times whether he shared the memo with Ghaffer, Spencer said, \\'How many different ways are you gonna ask the same question? I\\'m going to answer the same question again. I don\\'t remember giving (Ghaffer) that memo.\\'\\nBut the complaint said Spencer did, in fact, send the memo to the current owner.\\n\\'A warrant was done regarding the defendant\\'s email account which showed that (Ghaffer) was emailed a copy of the memo from the defendant\\'s personal email account after the memo was emailed to the defendant\\'s personal account from the defendant\\'s City of Milwaukee email account,\\' the complaint says. Ghaffer then used the document to tell inspectors he was exempt from getting an occupancy permit.\\nA court date was not immediately listed in online court records.\\nSpencer spent an embattled four years in office before losing his bid for a second term in April to state Rep. Evan Goyke.\\nSpencer\\'s tenure was defined by controversy and conflict. He oversaw an exodus of staff, including his own appointees. Ohiku, his top deputy, resigned amid allegations he was doing private legal work on the taxpayers\\' dime. He was subsequently charged with one count of attempted misconduct in public office for failing to disclose ownership of his private law firm while he was representing the city, a case in which he has reached a deferred prosecution agreement.\\nThe city\\'s inspector general has also called on Milwaukee County prosecutors to charge Spencer with misconduct in office on a range of issues.\\nIn a statement, Mayor Cavalier Johnson called the allegations against Spencer \\'disturbing and disappointing.\\'\\n\\'I have consistently called for accountability for those who violate the public\\'s trust. The voters of this city removed City Attorney Spencer from office in April. That was one form of accountability. He will now face accountability in a court of law,\\' Johnson said in a statement.\\n(This story was updated to add new information.)',\n",

       "   'excerpt': 'Trump returned to Wisconsin for his fourth event in nine days, after visiting the Democratic strongholds of Dane and Milwaukee counties last week.',\n",
       "   'summary': 'With less than a month until Election Day, former President Donald Trump returned to Wisconsin Sunday for a rally in Juneau, his fourth event in the swing state in just nine days.\\nBoth campaigns have been blanketing Wisconsin, with Vice President Kamala Harris visiting Ripon and receiving endorsements from Republicans, including former Rep. Liz Cheney. Last week, Trump campaigned in Dane County and Milwaukee, both large Democratic strongholds.\\nTrump spoke for nearly two hours at the Dodge County Airport, where he stood on stage inside an airport hangar with the crowd extending outside.\\nHere\\'s a recap of the day:\\nA Trump campaign official estimated the size of the crowd at the Dodge County Airport at 17,000.\\nDuring the rally, Trump repeated a false claim that 60,000 people tried to show up for his Sept. 28 event in Prairie du Chien. \"I think we\\'re getting close to that here,\" he proclaimed Sunday.\\nTrump\\'s speech lasted about two hours, wrapping up at 3:59 p.m. Some people appeared to be leaving more than 90 minutes after Trump began speaking. Those who remained, especially closer to the stage, were still engaged in his speech.\\nTrump has been speaking for over an hour and a half, and the 3:25 p.m. Green Bay Packers game has started.\\n\\'Donald Trump is once again showing how out of touch he is with Wisconsin. Holding a rally that overlaps with a Green Bay Packers game? Right now, thousands of Wisconsinites are doing exactly what they should: changing the channel from Trump\\'s extreme ramblings about Project 2025 and cheering on our Packers instead,\" Democratic Party of Wisconsin communications director Joe Oslund said in a statement.\\nTrump\\'s speech ended just as the first quarter of the Packers game came to a close.\\nTrump also brought onstage a group of Wisconsin sheriffs, where he announced their endorsement of him. Dodge County Sheriff Dale Schmidt said, \"we\\'re going to have the best, most secure election in Dodge County history.\"\\n\"I have something very important I think you\\'re going to want to hear. In Dodge County, in this 2024 election, there are zero drop boxes for the election,\" Schmidt said.\\nThe state Supreme Court recently reinstated the use of drop boxes in Wisconsin. Out of Wisconsin\\'s 72 counties, at least 66 had drop boxes as of spring 2021. While Republicans have heavily scrutinized the use of drop boxes, they were used widely in Wisconsin, including in conservative areas.\\nThe Republican mayor of Wausau gained national attention last month for removing the city\\'s drop box. The Wisconsin Department of Justice\\'s Division of Criminal Investigation is the lead investigator into the matter.\\nTrump has been speaking for over an hour and 15 minutes. He brought Senate candidate Eric Hovde, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson and U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil up on stage, joking \"we have plenty of time. It\\'s a Sunday, right?\"\\nJohnson thanked Trump for his \"new alliance\" with Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.\\n\"You are right about the enemy within. They are dividing us on purpose. They are destroying this nation. And by aligning with Bobby Kennedy, you are setting the example. The two of you set the differences aside,\" Johnson said.\\nSteil said that Republicans \"want to make sure people are following the laws\" in the election, including photo ID and only U.S. citizens are allowed to vote. Republicans placed a question on the November ballot in Wisconsin that would change language in the state constitution from \"every\" citizen to \"only\" citizens can vote.\\nRepublicans who support the measure want to prevent policies allowing noncitizens to vote in local elections from coming to Wisconsin in the future. Democrats are concerned the question implies that noncitizens are fraudulently voting in Wisconsin, which is extremely rare.\\nMore:What to know about noncitizen voting and the November referendum question in Wisconsin\\nTrump doesn\\'t often take aim at Wisconsin\\'s Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, but he briefly did so on Sunday. Evers has not yet announced whether he will run for reelection in 2026, though he has hinted at a third term.\\n\"I do hear just one thing about him, he doesn\\'t work hard. That\\'s the only thing I hear about him,\" Trump said. \"He\\'s a lousy governor. I guess they\\'ll work on that next cycle.\"\\nIn the Marquette University Law School poll released last week, Evers\\' job approval was at 48% and disapproval was at 46%. That was the first time since November 2023 that his approval rating dipped below 50%.\\nWith less than a month until Election Day, Trump encouraged people to return their mail-in absentee ballots \"as soon as you can\" or use in-person absentee voting opportunities, also known as early voting, beginning Oct. 22 in Wisconsin.\\nAs of Oct. 4, about 467,000 absentee ballots have been sent out to voters, according to data from the Wisconsin Elections Commission, and around 131,000 have been returned.\\nTrump and state party officials had sent mixed messages on early voting earlier this year, with Trump calling for \"one-day voting with paper ballots\" and other Republicans encouraging supporters to vote early so resources can be focused on those who haven\\'t voted yet.\\nMore:Eric Hovde says early voting starts before his one debate with Tammy Baldwin. Is he right?\\nTrump spent part of the beginning of his speech criticizing the administration\\'s response to Hurricane Helene. The death toll from the destructive hurricane has risen to more than 200.\\n\"Kamala Harris has left them stranded. This is the worst response to a storm or a catastrophe or a hurricane that we\\'ve ever seen,\" Trump said in part. \"The federal government, the White House is doing nothing. They\\'ve abandoned us. And, you know, it\\'s a largely Republican area, so some people say they did it for that reason.\"\\nFEMA has a webpage debunking misinformation surrounding the hurricane response, confirming that FEMA has enough money for immediate response and recovery needs, and no funding has been diverted for international efforts or border-related issues.\\nFederal assistance for survivors has surpassed $137 million, FEMA said Sunday. Nearly 7,000 federal workers are deployed, including FEMA staff.\\nTrump took the stage at 2:03 p.m., only a few minutes later than his scheduled 2 p.m. start time. Immediately before he walked onstage, the crowd sang and danced along to \"YMCA,\" a standard song at his rallies.\\n\"A very, very big hello to Wisconsin,\" Trump began. \"They say that Wisconsin is probably the toughest of the swing states to win. I don\\'t think so at all, we have got the biggest crowds.\"\\nRepublican Senate candidate Eric Hovde, who is challenging U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, spent most of his time onstage attacking Harris over the economy and international security.\\n\"Let\\'s listen to their whole spin on defending democracy,\" Hovde said, after critiquing the administration\\'s handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan and relations with Israel and China.\\n\"I don\\'t ever recall President Trump trying to censor Americans, but the left sure the heck wants all Americans to be quiet,\" he said, arguing Democrats have \"weaponized\" the court system.\\nHovde said Democrats are \"attacking\" and \"eroding\" democracy, citing \"America First\" candidate Thomas Leager, who was encouraged to run by a group supported by Democratic donors that has been recruiting candidates in key races that could swipe votes from legitimate Republican candidates.\\nAmong the speakers who took the stage before Trump was U.S. Rep. Scott Fitzgerald, whose hometown is Juneau. Fitzgerald is running for reelection in Wisconsin\\'s 5th Congressional District and faces Democratic challenger Ben Steinhoff.\\n\"I\\'ve been to Madison. I\\'ve been to liberal Madison, and they\\'re going to show up. We need to do the same thing, because we are the firewall ... to keep this country independent and free. Don\\'t believe this democracy talk,\" Fitzgerald said.\\nWhile Trump has not yet taken the stage, speakers in the pre-programming are standing behind barriers of bulletproof glass, which is now a standard U.S. Secret Service practice at outdoor rallies following his near-assassination.\\nThe Sunday rally is being held partly in a hangar at the airport, which includes the stage area. But attendees are also located outside of the covered airport hangar.\\nSupporters headed toward the entrance to Trump\\'s rally Sunday morning said they were there to show their support for him and expressed a sense of camaraderie with others in attendance.\\nOne person they did not hold in high esteem: former U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney.\\n\\'She\\'s a RINO,\\' said Jim Elst, 61, of Oconomowoc, using the acronym for Republican In Name Only.\\nHe was among those who used that description for the daughter of former Republican Vice President Dick Cheney. She appeared on Thursday with Harris in Ripon. The community is known as the birthplace of the GOP.\\nSupporters ranged in age and hailed from different hometowns but listed similar concerns that were fueling their plans to vote for Trump: the southern U.S. border and the economy.\\nSydney Roedl, 17, of Watertown, was looking forward to voting for Trump after she turns 18 just days before the election. She said the border and abortion were her top issues and that she had watched every night of the Republican National Convention that took place in Milwaukee in July.\\nSupporters also expressed a desire to show Trump they were backing him.\\nLouie LaPorte, 36, of Watertown said she had not been all that interested in politics until Trump was shot in an assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania in July. On Saturday, Trump returned to the same rally site.\\nLaPorte said Trump has \\'literally taken a bullet for us.\\'\\nShe said she had skipped church to come to the rally. There wasn\\'t anything specific she was hoping to hear from him.\\n\\'I am just here really to support him,\\' she said, again mentioning the attempted assassination.\\nThose who spoke with the Journal Sentinel didn\\'t plan to leave even if the rally continued past the beginning of the afternoon Green Bay Packers game, which starts at 3:25 p.m.\\nHours before Trump was set to speak in Juneau, the Harris campaign announced Gwen Walz will return to Wisconsin Wednesday to campaign in Beloit and Madison. Walz is Minnesota\\'s first lady and the wife of Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz.\\nMore:Gwen Walz will campaign in Beloit, Madison on Wednesday, continuing a string of visits\\nPresident Joe Biden also plans to visit Milwaukee Tuesday to highlight lead pipe replacement, though his trip is in an official capacity, rather than for the Harris campaign.\\nIn a call with reporters hosted by the Harris campaign, Republican surrogates criticized Trump\\'s visit and explained why they\\'re backing Harris. Those included Mark Becker, the former chair of the Republican Party of Brown County, and former U.S. Rep. Joe Walsh from Illinois.\\n\"If you had asked me five, six years ago if I would ever be campaigning for a Democrat, I would have said, \\'You\\'re nuts,\\'\" Becker said. \"Donald Trump has pushed me and so many others away from the party that I once believed in.\"\\nWalsh said Trump has \"reshaped the GOP into something extreme and dangerous,\" citing the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\\n\"Vice President Harris will be a uniter. She has deep respect for our democratic institutions,\" Walsh said. \"Put an end to Trumpism and reject the politics of division.\"\\nA line of cars waited to get into the Dodge County Airport hours before Trump was scheduled to take the stage.\\nOn the airport grounds, attendees were greeted by a larger-than-life Trump inflatable with which some were taking photos. A crowd was already in line to enter the event, and the runways were alive with people in Trump shirts and hats.\\nThere were also groups of heavily armed law enforcement.\\nTrump will hold his rally at the Dodge County Airport, located in Juneau. Trump is expected to speak at 2 p.m.\\nIn his most recent appearances in Wisconsin, Trump has typically not been over 30 minutes late to take the stage. His speeches often last around an hour and a half. Attendees may be keeping close tabs on the time: The Green Bay Packers face the Los Angeles Rams at 3:25 p.m. at SoFi Stadium in California.\\nUnlike his appearances last week in deeply blue Dane and Milwaukee counties, Trump\\'s Sunday rally takes him to a county he won comfortably in 2020. Dodge County voted nearly 65% for Trump over President Joe Biden.\\nThe latest Marquette University Law School poll released Wednesday showed Harris with a four-point lead over Trump among registered voters in Wisconsin, within the margin of error. The poll before that, released in mid-September, showed Harris with the same lead.',\n",

He\\'s the man. He means a lot to this place. Anybody who\\'s spent any kind of time here knows how special Bob is.\"\\nYelich was then asked how much the loss was contributing to his emotions.\\n\"For me it was talking to Ueck,\" he said. \"That\\'s kind of what -- tough one. All the other stuff is what it is. It\\'s a tough way for your season to end, but talking to \\'Uecky\\' one-on-one was tough.\\n\"That\\'s sports but by far the hardest part of the night for me was talking to Bob and all that stuff. He\\'s still kind of laughs through it all and that whole deal.\"\\nUecker returned to calling the game Thursday after being in the booth but not on the headset in Game 2. He was on the headset for the decisive ninth inning, which saw the Brewers surrender a 2-0 lead with two outs to go from their first playoff series win in their last five trips to the postseason.\\nIn Uecker\\'s sign-off, he articulated the pain of what had just happened on the field.\\n\"I\\'m telling you. That one,\" Uecker said, pausing to summarize the feeling of the moment, \"had some sting on it.\"\\n(This story was updated to change or add a photo or video.)\\nDevin Williams reaction:Brewers closer shoulders blame for Game 3 implosion',\n",

Amy Klobuchar in Minnesota. \\'There were no \\'good guys\\' in that war. The controlling interests had a jump ball. If you look closely, you see the link between liberalism and communism in the Allied forces.\\'\\nBacklash quickly ensued after the post was resurfaced by Heartland Signal. It comes as White lags behind in polls against Klobuchar. One recent poll from Minnesota Star Tribune/MPR News/KARE shows Klobuchar with an 11-point lead over White.\\nWhite replied to the resurfaced tweet on X, decrying the \"reconstruction of our global economy\" after World War II. \"It\\'s embarrassing to see how many of you liberals have become pro war and pro crony capitalism,\" he said.\\nNazi Germany and its collaborators killed more than 6 million Jewish people during WWII.\\n\"I said what I said, I said the bad guys won in World War II and they did win,\" White told USA TODAY. \"If people interpret that as me saying that the Allied forces defeating the Axis powers makes them the bad guys in the equation, that\\'s just stupid.\"\\nAsked for clarification, White said that \"neither the Allied forces nor the Axis powers won or lost the war\" and that \"there was a group of people who benefited from all the institutions that sprang out and sprang up after World War II.\"\\nHe said the people he\\'s referring to were \"globalists\" and \"the post-World War II democratic order.\"\\nA Minnesota native, White is making another attempt at a political career.

He has also come under fire for allegedly using campaign funds at a strip club, admitted to being transphobic and has told voters in the state that he is farther right than former President Donald Trump.\\nWhite is a former professional basketball player who played a total of three games in the NBA for the Sacramento Kings.\\nWhite was also the 16th overall pick of the 2012 NBA Draft being drafted by the Houston Rockets after attending Iowa State for college.\\nHe later played in the Big 3 league after being selected first overall.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'Since 1968, Rock and Roll Hall of Famers the Steve Miller Band — led by the Milwaukee native who turns 81 this month — has released 18 studio albums, along with several live albums and compilations, including the top-selling \"Greatest Hits 1974-1978.\" And from those albums, the band has had 19 songs make the Billboard Hot 100, five of them reaching the top 10 — including three that made it to No. 1.\\nHere\\'s a look back at the Steve Miller Band\\'s biggest hits.\\nWith \"The Joker,\" the title track of the band\\'s 1973 album, Miller told the Journal Sentinel he wasn\\'t purposefully trying to make a hit.\\n\"I was just trying to satisfy myself and come up with a good song with a nice harmony part and a cool acoustic guitar rhythm track,\" he said.\\nNeed a break?

It hit No. 1 that November.\\nThe title track of Steve Miller Band\\'s 1976 album features Miller supplementing his buttery \"do-do-do-do\" vocals and funk guitar with dreamy synths via the ARP Odyssey analog synthesizer, a perfect complement to Miller\\'s chants of \"slippin\\' slippin\\' slippin\\' into the future.\" \"Fly Like an Eagle,\" indisputably one of Miller\\'s most recognized songs (thanks partially to a hit cover by Seal for the soundtrack to the 1996 Michael Jordan-starring family flick \"Space Jam\"), didn\\'t quite conquer the Hot 100 — it peaked at No. 2 in 1977 — but it helped to make \"Fly Like an Eagle\" the band\\'s bestselling original studio album.\\nThe band\\'s second top 10 hit in 1977, \"Jet Airliner,\" actually was the lead single for a different Steve Miller Band album, \"Book of Dreams.\" Miller didn\\'t write \"Jet Airliner\" — it was composed by Paul Pena — but Miller brought his signature personality and guitar finesse to the recording. The song peaked at No. 8 in July 1977.\\nMiller told the Journal Sentinel that Capitol Records executives didn\\'t like \"Abracadabra,\" the title track of his 1982 album, and declined to buy radio ads for a North American arena tour. But the song became a hit anyway, first in Europe where Miller said it drew huge crowds for shows, and later in the United States. The song\\'s groovy, slightly mysterious lyrics and dreamy synths (with plenty of space reserved for Miller\\'s signature guitar) ultimately pushed it up to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks in September 1982. Forty-two years later, Miller\\'s song would be near the top of the Billboard Hot 100 yet again, via an interpolation at the heart of Eminem\\'s comeback hit \"Houdini.\" Eminem\\'s song debuted at No. 2.',\n",

Tim Walz faced off in New York City Tuesday night for the 2024 vice presidential debate, sparring over heated issues including abortion, border security and the economy.\\nThe debate, which went slightly above 90 minutes, was moderated by CBS anchors Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan.\\nBelow is a transcript of the exchange between the two vice-presidential nominees:\\nNORAH O' DONNELL: Tonight, with just over a month to go until Election day, the first and only meeting between the two men who hope to become vice president of the United States, democratic Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota and Republican Senator JD Vance of Ohio now, this is likely the final debate of this election cycle. And voting is already underway in 20 states. CBS news polling shows this remains a race either presidential candidate could win. The CBS news vice presidential debate starts now.\\nJD VANCE: Fight for every single vote, and we're going to take this country back.\\nTIM WALZ: And we are ready to continue to build the future together.\\nJD VANCE: We're going to turn this whole country red with President Donald J. Trump's leadership.\\nTIM WALZ: You know, it's at the end of this little journey? Kamala Harris as the next President of the United States.\\nThis is a CBS news special. Live from CBS news headquarters in New York. America decides the Vice Presidential debate.\\nNORAH O' DONNELL: Good evening. I'm Norah O'Donnell and thank you for joining us for tonight's CBS news vice presidential debate. We want to welcome our viewers on CBS, on other networks here in the US and around the world. We have a consequential night ahead, and our focus is the issues that matter to you, the voter. Let's introduce the candidates: Minnesota's democratic governor Tim Walz and Ohio's republican senator JD Vance. Tonight, meeting for the first time.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan. In order to have a thoughtful and civil debate, these are the rules that both campaigns have agreed to. Questions will be directed at one candidate who will have two minutes to respond. The other candidate will be allowed two minutes for rebuttal. Then each candidate will get another minute to make further points, with an additional 1 minute each at the discretion of the moderator. The primary role of the moderators is to facilitate the debate between the candidates, enforce the rules, and provide the candidates with the opportunity to fact check claims made by each other.\\nNORAH O' DONNELL: CBS news reserves the right to mute the candidates microphones to maintain decorum. We have not shared the questions or topics with the campaigns. The stage is set. Governor, Senator, thank you for joining us. Let's get started. Tonight, our country is facing several unfolding crises. The Middle East is on the brink of war. Americans are suffering from the catastrophic impact of Hurricane Helene and now a labor strike as 25,000 dock workers from Maine to Texas are picketing. We're going to begin tonight with the Middle East, Margaret.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Norah. Earlier today, Iran launched its largest attack yet on Israel. But that attack failed thanks to joint US and Israeli defensive action. President Biden has deployed more than 40,000 US military personnel and assets to that region over the past year to try to prevent a regional war. Iran is weakened, but the US still considers it the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world, and it has drastically reduced the time it would take to develop a nuclear weapon. It is down now to one or two weeks time. Governor Walz, if you are the final voice in the situation room, would you support or oppose a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran? You have two minutes.\\nTIM WALZ: Well, thank you. And thank you for those joining at home tonight. Let's keep in mind where this started. October 7th, Hamas terrorists massacred over 1400 Israelis and took prisoners. Iran, or, Israel's ability to be able to defend itself is absolutely fundamental, getting its hostages back, fundamental, and ending the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. But the expansion of Israel and its proxies is an absolute, fundamental necessity for the United States to have the steady leadership there. You saw it experienced today, where, along with our Israeli partners and our coalition, able to stop the incoming attack. But what's fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter. It's clear. And the world saw it on that debate stage a few weeks ago. A nearly 80 year old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not what we need in this moment. But it's not just that. It's those that were closest to Donald Trump that understand how dangerous he is when the world is this dangerous. His Chief of Staff, John Kelly, said that he was the most flawed humanity being he'd ever met. And both of his Secretaries of Defense and his national security advisors said he should be nowhere near the White House. Now, the person closest to them, to Donald Trump, said he's unfit for the highest office. That was Senator Vance. What we've seen out of Vice President Harris is we've seen steady leadership. We've seen a calmness that is able to be able to draw on the coalitions, to bring them together, understanding that our allies matter. When our allies see Donald Trump turn towards Vladimir Putin, turn towards North Korea, when we start to see that type of fickleness around holding the coalitions together, we will stay committed. And as the Vice President said today, is we will protect our forces and our allied forces, and there will be consequences.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, your time is up. Senator Vance, the same question, would you support or oppose a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran? You have two minutes.\\nJD VANCE: So, Margaret, I want to answer the question. First of all, thanks, Governor. Thanks to CBS for hosting the debate. And thanks most importantly to the American people who are watching this evening and caring enough about this country to pay attention to this Vice Presidential debate. I want to answer the question, but I want to actually give an introduction to myself a little bit because I recognize a lot of Americans don't know who either one of us are. I was raised in a working class family. My mother required food assistance for periods of her life. My grandmother required Social Security help to raise me. And she raised me in part because my own mother struggled with addiction for a big chunk of my early life. I went to college on the GI bill after I enlisted in the Marine Corps and served in Iraq. And so I stand here asking to be your Vice President with extraordinary gratitude for this country, for the American dream that made it possible for me to live my dreams. And most importantly, I know that a lot of you are worried about the chaos in the world and the feeling that the American Dream is unattainable. I want to try to convince you tonight over the next 90 minutes that if we get better leadership in the White House, if we get Donald Trump back in the White House, the American Dream is going to be attainable once again. Now, to answer this particular question, we have to remember that as much as Governor Walz just accused Donald Trump of being an agent of chaos, Donald Trump actually delivered stability in the world, and he did it by establishing effective deterrence. People were afraid of stepping out of line. Iran, which launched this attack, has received over $100 billion in unfrozen assets thanks to the Kamala Harris administration. What do they use that money for? They use it to buy weapons that they're now launching against our allies and, God forbid, potentially launching against the United States as well. Donald Trump recognized that for people to fear the United States, you needed peace through strength. They needed to recognize that if they got out of line, the United States' global leadership would put stability and peace back in the world. Now, you asked about a preemptive strike, Margaret, and I want to answer the question. Look, it is up to Israel what they think they need to do to keep their country safe. And we should support our allies wherever they are when they're fighting the bad guys. I think that's the right approach to take with the Israel question.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Senator. Governor Walz, do you care to respond to any of the allegations?\\nTIM WALZ: Well, look, Donald Trump was in office. We'll sometimes hear a revisionist history, but when Donald Trump was in office, it was Donald Trump who… we had a coalition of nations that had boxed Iran's nuclear program in in the inability to advance it. Donald Trump pulled that program and put nothing else in its place. So Iran is closer to a nuclear weapon than they were before because of Donald Trump's fickle leadership. And when Iran shot down an American aircraft in international airspace, Donald Trump tweeted, because that's the standard diplomacy of Donald Trump. And when Iranian missiles did fall near US troops and they received traumatic brain injuries, Donald Trump wrote it off as headaches. Look, our allies understand that Donald Trump is fickle. He will go to whoever has the most flattery or where it makes sense to him. Steady leadership like you witnessed today, like you witnessed in April. Both Iranian attacks were repelled. Our coalition is strong, and we need the steady leadership that Kamala Harris is providing.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Vance, the US did have a diplomatic deal with Iran to temporarily pause parts of its nuclear program, and President Trump did exit that deal. He recently said just five days ago, the US must now make a diplomatic deal with Iran because the consequences are impossible. Did he make a mistake? You have 1 minute.\\nJD VANCE: Well, first of all, Margaret, diplomacy is not a dirty word, but I think that's something that Governor Walz just said is quite extraordinary. You, yourself, just said Iran is as close to a nuclear weapon today as they have ever been. And, Governor Walz, you blame Donald Trump, who has been the Vice President for the last three and a half years, and the answer is your running mate, not mine. Donald Trump consistently made the world more secure. Now, we talk about the sequence of events that led us to where we are right now, and you can't ignore October the 7th, which I appreciate Governor Walz bringing up. But when did Iran and Hamas and their proxies attack Israel? It was during the administration of Kamala Harris. So Governor Walz can criticize Donald Trump's tweets, but effective, smart diplomacy and peace through strength is how you bring stability back to a very broken world. Donald Trump has already done it once before. Ask yourself at home, when, when was the last time? I'm 40 years old. When was the last time that an American President didn't have a major conflict, breakout? The only answer is during the four years that Donald Trump was President.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Gentlemen, we have a lot to get to. Norah?\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Margaret, thank you. Let's turn now to Hurricane Helene. The storm could become one of the deadliest on record. More than 160 people are dead and hundreds more are missing. Scientists say climate change makes these hurricanes larger, stronger and more deadly because of the historic rainfall. Senator Vance, according to CBS news polling, seven in ten Americans and more than 60% of Republicans under the age of 45 favor the US taking steps to try and reduce climate change. Senator, what responsibility would the Trump administration have to try and reduce the impact of climate change? I'll give you two minutes.\\nJD VANCE: Sure. So first of all, let's start with the hurricane because it's an unbelievable, unspeakable human tragedy. I just saw today, actually, a photograph of two grandparents on a roof with a six year old child, and it was the last photograph ever taken of them because the roof collapsed and those innocent people lost their lives. And I'm sure Governor Walz joins me in saying our hearts go out to those innocent people, our prayers go out to them. And we want as robust and aggressive as a federal response as we can get to save as many lives as possible. And then, of course, afterwards, to help the people in those communities rebuild. I mean, these are communities that I love, some of them I know very personally. In Appalachia, all across the Southeast, they need their government to do their job. And I commit that when Donald Trump is president again, the government will put the citizens of this country first when they suffer from a disaster. And Norah, you asked about climate change. I think this is a very important issue. Look, a lot of people are justifiably worried about all these crazy weather patterns. I think it's important for us, first of all, to say Donald Trump and I support clean air, clean water. We want the environment to be cleaner and safer, but one of the things that I've noticed some of our democratic friends talking a lot about is a concern about carbon emissions. This idea that carbon emissions drives all the climate change. Well, let's just say that's true, just for the sake of argument, so we're not arguing about weird science. Let's just say that's true. Well, if you believe that, what would you, what would you want to do? The answer is that you'd want to reshore as much American manufacturing as possible and you'd want to produce as much energy as possible in the United States of America because we're the cleanest economy in the entire world. What have Kamala Harris's policies actually led to? More energy production in China, more manufacturing overseas, more doing business in some of the dirtiest parts of the entire world. When I say that, I mean the amount of carbon emissions they're doing per unit of economic output. So if we actually care about getting cleaner air and cleaner water, the best thing to do is to double down and invest in American workers and the American people. And unfortunately, Kamala Harris has done exactly the opposite.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Governor Walz, you have two minutes to respond.\\nTIM WALZ: Well, we got close to an agreement because all those things are happening. Look, first of all, it is a horrific tragedy with this hurricane, and my heart goes out to the folks that are down there in contact with the Governors. I serve as co-chair of the council of governors as we work together on these emergency managements. Governors know no partisanship. They work together to… all of the Governors and the emergency responders are on the ground. Those happen on the front end. The federal government comes in, makes sure they're there, that we recover. But we're still in that phase where we need to make sure that they're staying there, staying focused. Now, look, coming back to the climate change issue, there's no doubt this thing roared onto the scene faster and stronger than anything we've seen. Senator Vance has said that there's a climate problem in the past, Donald Trump called it a hoax and then joked that these things would make more beachfront property to be able to invest in. What we've seen out of the Harris administration now, the Biden Harris administration is, we've seen this investment, we've seen massive investments, the biggest in global history that we've seen in the Inflation Reduction Act, has created jobs all across the country. Two thousand in Jeffersonville, Ohio. Taking the EV technology that we invented and making it here. Two hundred thousand jobs across the country. The largest solar manufacturing plant in North America sits in Minnesota. But my farmers know climate change is real. They've seen 500 year droughts, 500 year floods, back to back. But what they're doing is adapting, and this has allowed them to tell me, 'Look, I harvest corn, I harvest soybean, and I harvest wind.' We are producing more natural gas and more oil at any time than we ever have. We're also producing more clean energy. So the solution for us is to continue to move forward, that climate change is real. Reducing our impact is absolutely critical. But this is not a false choice. You can do that at the same time you're creating the jobs that we're seeing all across the country. That's exactly what this administration has done. We are seeing us becoming an energy superpower for the future, not just the current. And that's what absolutely makes sense. And then we start thinking about, 'How do we mitigate these disasters?'\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Thank you, Senator. I want to give you an opportunity to respond there. The Governor mentioned that President Trump has called climate change a hoax. Do you agree?\\nJD VANCE: Well, look, what the President has said is that if the Democrats, in particular, Kamala Harris and her leadership, if they really believe that climate change is serious, what they would be doing is more manufacturing and more energy production in the United States of America, and that's not what they're doing. So clearly, Kamala Harris herself doesn't believe her own rhetoric on this. If she did, she would actually agree with Donald Trump's energy policies. Now, something Governor Walz said, I think is important to touch upon, because when we talk about 'clean energy,' I think that's a slogan that often the Democrats will use here. I'm talking, of course, about the Democratic leadership. And the real issue is that if you're spending hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars of American taxpayer money on solar panels that are made in China, number one, you're going to make the economy dirtier. We should be making more of those solar panels here in the United States of America.\\nTIM WALZ: We are. In Minnesota.\\nJD VANCE: Some of them are, Tim, but a lot of them are being made overseas in China, especially the components that go into those solar panels. So if you really want to make the environment cleaner, you've got to invest in more energy production. We haven't built a nuclear facility, I think one, in the past 40 years. Natural gas. We got to invest more in it. Kamala Harris has done the opposite. That's raised energy prices and also meant that we're doing worse by the climate.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Senator, your time is up. Governor, would you like to respond?\\nTIM WALZ: Well, look, we're producing more natural gas than we ever have. There's no moratorium on that. We're producing more oil. But the folks know, and my… like I said, again, these are not liberal folks. These are not folks that are green, new deal folks. These are farmers that have been, drought one year, massive flooding the next year. They understand that it makes sense. Look, our number one export cannot be topsoil from erosion from these massive storms. We saw it in Minnesota this summer. And thinking about, 'How do we respond to that?' we're thinking ahead on this and what Kamala Harris has been able to do in Minnesota, we're starting to weatherproof some of these things. The infrastructure law that was passed allows us to think about mitigation in the future. How do we make sure that we're protecting by burying our power lines? How do we make sure that we're protecting lakefronts and things that we're seeing more and more of. But to call it a hoax and to take the oil company executives to Mar-a-Lago, say, give me money for my campaign and I'll let you do whatever you want. We can be smarter about that. And an all above energy policy is exactly what she's doing, creating those jobs right here.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Governor, your time is up. The overwhelming consensus among scientists is that the earth's climate is warming at an unprecedented rate. Margaret?\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Norah. We're going to turn now to immigration. The crisis at the US-Mexico border consistently ranks as one of the top issue for American voters. Senator Vance, your campaign is pledging to carry out the largest mass deportation plan in American history and to use the US military to do so. Could you be more specific about exactly how this will work? For example, would you deport parents who have entered the US illegally and separate them from any of their children who were born on US soil? You have two minutes.\\nJD VANCE: So first of all, Margaret, before we talk about deportations, we have to stop the bleeding. We have a historic immigration crisis because Kamala Harris started and said that she wanted to undo all of Donald Trump's border policies. Ninety-four executive orders suspending deportations, decriminalizing illegal aliens, massively increasing the asylum fraud that exists in our system, that has opened the floodgates. And what it's meant is that a lot of fentanyl is coming into our country. I had a mother who struggled with opioid addiction and has gotten clean. I don't want people who are struggling with addiction to be deprived of their second chance because Kamala Harris let in fentanyl into our communities at record levels. So you've got to stop the bleeding. You've got to re-implement Donald Trump's border policies, build the wall, re-implement deportations. And that gets me to your point, Margaret, about what do we actually do? So we've got 20, 25 million illegal aliens who are here in the country. What do we do with them? I think the first thing that we do is we start with the criminal migrants. About a million of those people have committed some form of crime in addition to crossing the border illegally. I think you start with deportations on those folks, and then I think you make it harder for illegal aliens to undercut the wages of American workers. A lot of people will go home if they can't work for less than minimum wage in our own country. And by the way, that'll be really good for our workers who just want to earn a fair wage for doing a good day's work. And the final point, Margaret, is you ask about family separation. Right now in this country, Margaret, we have 320,000 children that the Department of Homeland Security has effectively lost. Some of them have been sex trafficked, some of them hopefully are at homes with their families, some of them have been used as drug trafficking mules. The real family separation policy in this country is, unfortunately, Kamala Harris's wide open southern border. And I'd ask my fellow Americans to remember when she came into office, she said she was going to do this. Real leadership would be saying, 'You know what? I screwed up. We're going to go back to Donald Trump's border policies.' I wish that she would do that, it would be good for all of us.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, do you care to respond to any of those specific allegations, including that the Vice President is, quote, 'letting in fentanyl and using kids as drug mules, among other things…'\\nTIM WALZ: Yeah, well…\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: … regarding children?\\nTIM WALZ: The drug mule is not true. But I will say about this, about the fentanyl, because this is a crisis of this, the opioid crisis. And the good news on this is the last twelve months saw the largest decrease in opioid deaths in our nation's history, 30% decrease in Ohio. But there's still more work to do. But let's go back to this on immigration. Kamala Harris was the Attorney General of the largest state and a border state in California. She's the only person in this race who prosecuted transnational gangs for human trafficking and drug interventions. But look, we all want to solve this. Most of us want to solve this. And that is the United States Congress. That's the Border Patrol Agents, that's the Chamber of Commerce. That's most Americans out here. That's why we had the fairest and the toughest bill on immigration that this nation's seen. It was crafted by a conservative senator from Oklahoma, James Lankford. I know him. He's super conservative, but he's a man of principle, wants to get it done. Democrats and Republicans worked on this piece of legislation. The Border Patrol said, this is what we need in here. These are the experts. And the Chamber of Commerce in the Wall Street Journal said, pass this thing. Kamala Harris helped get there. Fifteen hundred new border agents, detection for drugs, DOJ money to speed up these adjudications on this. Just what America wants. But as soon as it was getting ready to pass and actually tackle this Donald Trump said 'No,' told them to vote against it because it gives him a campaign issue. It gives him, what would Donald Trump talk about if we actually did some of these things? And they need to be done by the legislature. You can't just do this through the executive branch. So, look, we have the options to do this. Donald Trump had four years. He had four years to do this. And he promised you, America, how easy it would be. I'll build you a big, beautiful wall and Mexico will pay for it. Less than 2% of that wall got built and Mexico didn't pay a dime. But here we are again, nine years after he came down that escalator, dehumanizing people and telling them what he was going to do. As far as a deportation plan, at one point, Senator Vance said it was so unworkable as to be laughable. So that's where we're at. Pass the bill. She'll sign it.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, your time is up. Senator, the question was, will you separate parents from their children, even if their kids are US citizens? You have 1 minute.\\nJD VANCE: Margaret, my point is that we already have massive child separations thanks to Kamala Harris' open border. And I didn't accuse Kamala Harris of inviting drug mules, I said that she enabled the Mexican drug cartels to operate freely in this country, and we know that they use children as drug mules, and it is a disgrace and it has to stop. Look, I think what Tim said just doesn't pass the smell test. For three years, Kamala Harris went out bragging that she was going to undo Donald Trump's border policy. She did exactly that. We had a record number of illegal crossings. We had a record number of fentanyl coming into our country. And now, now that she's running for President, or a few months before, she says that somehow she got religion and cared a lot about a piece of legislation. The only thing that she did when she became the Vice President, when she became the appointed border czar, was to undo 94 Donald Trump executive actions that opened the border. This problem is leading to massive problems in the United States of America. Parents who can't afford health care, schools that are overwhelmed. It's got to stop, and it will when Donald Trump is President again.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, your time is up. Governor, what about our CBS news polling, which does show that a majority of Americans, more than 50%, support mass deportations?\\nTIM WALZ: Look, we fix this issue with a bill that is necessary. But the issue on this is this is what happens when you don't want to solve it. You demonize it. And we saw this, and Senator Vance, and it surprises me on this, talking about and saying, 'I will create stories to bring attention to this.' That vilified a large number of people who were here legally in the community of Springfield. The Republican Governor said, 'It's not true. Don't do it.' There's consequences for this. There's consequences. We could come together. Senator Lankford did it. We could come together and solve this if we didn't let Donald Trump continue to make it an issue. And the consequences in Springfield were the Governor had to send state law enforcement to escort kindergarteners to school. I believe Senator Vance wants to solve this. But by standing with Donald Trump and not working together to find a solution, it becomes a talking point. And when it becomes a talking point like this, we dehumanize and villainize other human beings.\\nJD VANCE: Tim…\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor. Governor, your time is up. Senator, I'll give you 1 minute, but let me just ask you the question first. The governor has made the point, and I think as a sitting lawmaker, you know that Congress controls the purse strings and any funding. So you have said repeatedly that Donald Trump would, through executive action, solve this. Do you disagree that Congress controls the purse strings and would need to support many of the changes that you would actually want to implement? You have 1 minute.\\nJD VANCE: Look, Margaret, first of all, the gross majority of what we need to do at the southern border is just empowering law enforcement to do their job. I've been to the southern border more than our Borders are, Kamala Harris has been. And it's actually heartbreaking because the Border Patrol Agents, they just want to be empowered to do their job. Of course, additional resources would help. But most of this is about the President and the Vice President empowering our law enforcement to say, 'If you try to come across the border illegally, you've got to stay in Mexico, you've got to go back through proper channels.' Now, Governor Walz brought up the community of Springfield, and he's very worried about the things that I've said in Springfield. Look, in Springfield, Ohio and in communities all across this country, you've got schools that are overwhelmed, you've got hospitals that are overwhelmed, you have got housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes. The people that I'm most worried about in Springfield, Ohio, are the American citizens who have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris's open border. It is a disgrace, Tim. And I actually think, I agree with you. I think you want to solve this problem, but I don't think that Kamala Harris does.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, your time is up. Governor, you have 1 minute to respond.\\nTIM WALZ: Yeah, well, it is law enforcement that asked for the bill. They helped craft it. They're the ones that supported it. It was… that's because they know we need to do this. Look, this issue of continuing to bring this up, of not dealing with it, of blaming migrants for everything. On housing, we could talk a little bit about Wall Street speculators buying up housing and making them less affordable, but it becomes a blame. Look, this bill also gives the money necessary to adjudicate. I agree. It should not take seven years for an asylum claim to be done. This bill gets it done in 90 days. Then you start to make a difference in this and you start to adhere to what we know. American principles. I don't talk about my faith a lot, but Matthew 25:40 talks about, 'To the least amongst us, you do unto me.' I think that's true of most Americans. They simply want order to it. This bill does it. It's funded, it's supported by the people who do it, and it lets us keep our dignity about how we treat other people.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Governor. And just to clarify for our viewers, Springfield, Ohio does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status. Temporary protected status. Norah.\\nJD VANCE: Well, Margaret, Margaret, I think it's important because…\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, senator. We have so much to get to.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: We're going to turn out of the economy. Thank you.\\nJD VANCE: Margaret. The rules were that you guys were going to fact check, and since you're fact checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on. So there's an application called the CBP One app where you can go on as an illegal migrant, apply for asylum or apply for parole and be granted legal status at the wave of a Kamala Harris open border wand. That is not a person coming in, applying for a green card and waiting for ten years.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Senator.\\nJD VANCE: That is the facilitation of illegal immigration, Margaret, by our own leadership. And Kamala Harris opened up that pathway.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Senator, for describing the legal process. We have so much to get to.\\nTIM WALZ: Those laws have been in the book since 1990.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, gentlemen. We want to have -\\nTIM WALZ: The CBP app has not been on the books since 1990. It's something that Kamala Harris created, Margaret.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Gentlemen, the audience can't hear you because your mics are cut. We have so much we want to get to. Thank you for explaining the legal process. Norah?\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Thank you, Margaret. The economy is a top concern for voters. Each of your campaigns has released an economic plan, so let's talk about the specifics. Governor Walz, Vice President Harris unveiled a plan that includes billions in tax credits for manufacturing, housing and a renewed child tax credit. The Wharton School says your proposals will increase the nation's deficit by $1.2 trillion. How would you pay for that without ballooning the deficit? Governor, I'll give you two minutes.\\nTIM WALZ: Yeah. Thank you. And Kamala Harris and I do believe in the middle class because that's where we come from. We both grew up in that. We understand. So those of you out there listening tonight, you're hearing a lot of stuff back and forth. And it's good. It's healthy. That's what this is supposed to happen. You should be listening. 'How's this going to impact me?' The bold forward plan that Kamala Harris put out there is, one, is talking about this housing issue. The one thing is there's 3 million new houses proposed under this plan with down payment assistance on the front end. To get you in a house. A house is much more than just an asset to be traded somewhere. It's foundational to where you're at. And then making sure that the things you buy every day, whether they be prescription drugs or other things, that there's fairness in that. Look, the $35 insulin is a good thing, but it costs $5 to make insulin. They were charging $800 before this law went into effect. As far as the housing goes, I've seen it in Minnesota, 12% more houses in Minneapolis, prices went down on rent, 4%. It's working. And then making sure tax cuts go to the middle class, $6,000 child tax credit. We have one in Minnesota, reduces childhood poverty by a third. We save money in the long run and we do the right thing for families and then getting businesses off the ground. The law, as it stands right now, is $5,000 tax credit for small business, increasing that to $50,000. Now, this is a philosophical difference between us. Donald Trump made a promise, and I'll give you this. He kept it. He took folks to Mar-a-Lago. He said, 'You're rich as hell. I'm going to give you a tax cut.' He gave the tax cuts that predominantly went to the top caste. What happened there was an $8 trillion increase in the national debt, the largest ever. Now he's proposing a 20% consumption or sales tax on everything we bring in. Everyone agrees, including businesses. It would be destabilizing it. It would increase inflation and potentially lead to a recession. Look, this is simple for you. Where are we going? Kamala Harris has said to do the things she wants to do. We'll just ask the wealthiest to pay their fair share. When you do that, our system works best. More people are participating in it, and folks have the things that they need.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Senator, I want to give you a moment to respond on that. But similarly, the Wharton School has done an analysis of the Trump plan and says it would increase the nation's deficit by 5.8 trillion. My question is the same for you. How do you pay for all that without ballooning the deficit? I'll give you two minutes.\\nJD VANCE: Well, first of all, you're going to hear a lot from Tim Walz this evening, and you just heard it in the answer, a lot of what Kamala Harris proposes to do. And some of it, I'll be honest with you, it even sounds pretty good. Here's what you won't hear, is that Kamala Harris has already done it. Because she's been the Vice President for three and a half years, she had the opportunity to enact all of these great policies. And what she's actually done instead is drive the cost of food higher by 25%, drive the cost of housing higher by about 60%, open the American southern border and make middle class life unaffordable for a large number of Americans. If Kamala Harris has such great plans for how to address middle class problems, then she ought to do them now, not when asking for a promotion, but in the job the American people gave her three and a half years ago. And the fact that she isn't, tells you a lot about how much you can trust her actual plans. Now, Donald Trump's economic plan is not just a plan, but it's also a record. A lot of those same economists attack Donald Trump's plans, and they have PhDs, but they don't have common sense and they don't have wisdom, because Donald Trump's economic policies delivered the highest take home pay in a generation in this country, 1.5% inflation, and to boot, peace and security all over the world. So when people say that Donald Trump's economic plan doesn't make sense, I say 'Look at the record he delivered: rising take home pay for American workers.' Now, Tim admirably admits that they want to undo the Trump tax cuts. But if you look at what was so different about Donald Trump's tax cuts, even from previous Republican tax cut plans, is that a lot of those resources went to giving more take home pay to middle class and working class Americans. It was passed in 2017, and you saw an American economic boom unlike we've seen in a generation in this country. That is a record that I'm proud to run on and we're going to get back to that common sense wisdom so that you can afford to live the American Dream again. I know a lot of you are struggling. I know a lot of you are worried about paying the bills. It's going to stop when Donald Trump brings back common sense to this country.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Governor, do you want to respond to that? What has Kamala Harris done for the middle class?\\nTIM WALZ: Yeah. Yeah, well, Kamala Harris' day one was Donald Trump's failure on COVID that led to the collapse of our economy. We were already before COVID, in a manufacturing recession. But 10 million people out of work, largest percentage since the Great Depression, 9 million jobs closed on that. That was day one. Whether it was the Infrastructure Act or other things, we moved. Now, you made a question about experts, said this, I made a note of this. 'Economists don't, can't be trusted. Science can't be trusted. National security folks can't be trusted.' Look, if you're going to be President, you don't have all the answers. Donald Trump believes he does. My pro tip of the day is this, if you need heart surgery, listen to the people at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, not Donald Trump. And the same thing goes with this and I ask you out there, teachers, nurses, truck drivers, whatever, how is it fair that you're paying your taxes every year and Donald Trump hasn't paid any Federal Tax 10 to last 15 years, in the last year as President? That's what's wrong with the system. There's a way around it. And he's bragged about that. We're just asking for fairness in it, and that's all you want.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: You have a minute.\\nJD VANCE: Governor, you say trust the experts, but those same experts for 40 years said that if we shipped our manufacturing base off to China, we'd get cheaper goods. They lied about that. They said if we shipped our industrial base off to other countries, to Mexico and elsewhere, it would make the middle class stronger. They were wrong about that. They were wrong about the idea that if we made America less self-reliant, less productive in our own Nation, that it would somehow make us better off. And they were wrong about it. And for the first time in a generation, Donald Trump had the wisdom and the courage to say to that bipartisan consensus, we're not doing it anymore. We're bringing American manufacturing back. We're unleashing American energy. We're going to make more of our own stuff. And this isn't just an economic issue. I mean, I've got three beautiful little kids at home: seven, four and two. And I love them very much. And I hope they're in bed right now. But look, so many of the drugs, the pharmaceuticals that we put in the bodies of our children are manufactured by nations that hate us. This has to stop. And we're not going to stop it by listening to experts. We're going to stop it by listening to common sense wisdom, which is what Donald Trump governed on.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Senator, your time is up. Governor Walz, can you address that? I mean, voters say they trust Donald Trump on the economy more. Why?\\nTIM WALZ: If you're listening tonight, and you want billionaires to get tax cuts, you heard what the numbers were. Look, I'm a union guy on this. I'm not a guy who wanted to ship things overseas, but I understand that, look, we produce soybeans and corn. We need to have fair trading partners. That's something that we believe in. I think the thing that most concerns me on this is, is Donald Trump was the guy who created the largest trade deficit in American history with China. So the rhetoric is good. Much of what the senator said right there, I'm in agreement with him on this. I watched it happen, too. I watched it in my communities and we talked about that. But we had people undercutting the right to collectively bargain. We had right to work states made it more difficult. We had companies that were willing to ship it over, and we saw people profit. Folks that, folks that are venture capital, in some cases, putting money into companies that were overseas, we're in agreement that we bring those home. The issue is Donald Trump is talking about it. Kamala Harris has a record. Two hundred fifty thousand more manufacturing jobs just out of the IRA.\\nJD VANCE: May I respond to that?\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Yes.\\nJD VANCE: So, appreciate that. So if you notice, what Governor Walz just did is he said, 'First of all, Donald Trump has to listen to the experts.' And then when he acknowledged that the experts screwed up, he said, well, 'Donald Trump didn't do nearly as good of a job as the statistics show that he did.'\\nTIM WALZ: No, that's a gross generalization.\\nJD VANCE: So what Tim Walz is doing. And I honestly, Tim, I think you got a tough job here because you've got to play whack-a-mole. You've got to pretend that Donald Trump didn't deliver rising take home pay. Which, of course, he did. You've got to pretend that Donald Trump didn't deliver lower inflation, which, of course, he did. And then you've simultaneously got to defend Kamala Harris's atrocious economic record, which has made gas, groceries, and housing unaffordable for American citizens. I was raised by a woman who would sometimes go into medical debt so that she could put food on the table in our household. I know what it's like to not be able to afford the things that you need to afford. We can do so much better. To all of you watching, we can get back to an America that's affordable again. We just got to get back to common sense, economic principles.\\nTIM WALZ: I hope we have a conversation on health care then.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Senator. Governor.\\nJD VANCE: Please.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Thank you, Margaret.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We have a lot to get to ahead, gentlemen, on many topics. But right now I want to talk about personal qualifications. The Vice President is often the last voice the President hears before making consequential decisions. We want to ask you about your leadership qualities, Governor Walz. You said you were in Hong Kong during the deadly Tiananmen Square protest in the spring of 1989. But Minnesota Public Radio and other media outlets are reporting that you actually didn't travel to Asia until August of that year. Can you explain that discrepancy? You have two minutes.\\nTIM WALZ: Yeah. Well, and to the folks out there who didn't get at the top of this, look, I grew up in small, rural Nebraska, town of 400. Town that you rode your bike with your buddies till the streetlights come on, and I'm proud of that service. I joined the National Guard at 17, worked on family farms, and then I used the GI bill to become a teacher. Passionate about it, a young teacher. My first year out, I got the opportunity in the summer of 89 to travel to China, 35 years ago, be able to do that. I came back home and then started a program to take young people there. We would take basketball teams, we would take baseball teams, we would take dancers, and we would go back and forth to China. The issue for that was, was to try and learn. Now, look, my community knows who I am. They saw where I was at. They, look, I will be the first to tell you I have poured my heart into my community. I've tried to do the best I can, but I've not been perfect. And I'm a knucklehead at times, but it's always been about that. Those same people elected me to Congress for twelve years. And in Congress I was one of the most bipartisan people. Working on things like farm bills that we got done, working on veterans benefits. And then the people of Minnesota were able to elect me to governor twice. So look, my commitment has been from the beginning, to make sure that I'm there for the people, to make sure that I get this right. I will say more than anything, many times, I will talk a lot. I will get caught up in the rhetoric. But being there, the impact it made, the difference it made in my life. I learned a lot about China. I hear the critiques of this. I would make the case that Donald Trump should have come on one of those trips with us. I guarantee you he wouldn't be praising Xi Jinping about COVID. And I guarantee you he wouldn't start a trade war that he ends up losing. So this is about trying to understand the world. It's about trying to do the best you can for your community, and then it's putting yourself out there and letting your folks understand what it is. My commitment, whether it be through teaching, which I was good at, or whether it was being a good soldier or was being a good member of Congress, those are the things that I think are the values that people care about.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, just to follow up on that, the question was, can you explain the discrepancy?\\nTIM WALZ: No. All I said on this was, is, I got there that summer and misspoke on this, so I will just, that's what I've said. So I was in Hong Kong and China during the democracy protest, went in, and from that, I learned a lot of what needed to be in governance.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, governor. Senator Vance, in 2016, you called your running mate, Donald Trump, unfit for the nation's highest office, and you said he could be America's Hitler. I know you've said, you've been asked many times, and you've said you regret those comments and explained, you then voted for Donald Trump in 2020. But the Washington Post reported new messages last week in which you also disparaged Trump's economic record while he was President. Writing to someone in 2020, quote, 'Trump thoroughly failed to deliver his economic populism.' You're now his running mate, and you've shifted many of your policy stances to align with his. If you become Vice President, why should Americans trust that you will give Donald Trump the advice he needs to hear, and not just the advice he wants to hear? You have two minutes.\\nJD VANCE: Well, first of all, Margaret, because I've always been open and sometimes, of course, I've disagreed with the President, but I've also been extremely open about the fact that I was wrong about Donald Trump. I was wrong, first of all, because I believed some of the media stories that turned out to be dishonest fabrications of his record. But most importantly, Donald Trump delivered for the American people rising wages, rising take home pay, an economy that worked for normal Americans. A secure southern border. A lot of things, frankly, that I didn't think he'd be able to deliver on. And yeah, when you screw up, when you misspeak, when you get something wrong and you change your mind, you ought to be honest with the American people about it. It's one of the reasons, Margaret, why I've done so many interviews is because I think it's important to actually explain to the American people where I come down on the issues and what changed. Now you pointed out to messages from 2020. Margaret, I've been extremely consistent that I think there were a lot of things that we could have done better in the Trump administration the first round, if Congress was doing its job. I strongly believe, and I've been a United States Senator, that Congress is not just a high-class debating society. It's not just a forum for senators and congressmen to whine about problems. It's a forum to govern. So there were a lot of things on the border, on tariffs, for example, where I think that we could have done so much more if the Republican Congress and the Democrats in Congress had been a little bit better about how they governed the country. They were so obsessed with impeaching Donald Trump, they couldn't actually govern. And I want to talk about this tariff issue in particular, Margaret, because, you know, Tim just accused this of being a national sales tax. Look, the one thing, and you're not probably surprised to hear me praising Joe Biden, but the one thing that Joe Biden did is he continued some of the Trump tariffs that protected American manufacturing jobs. And it's the one issue, the most pro worker part of the Biden administration. It's the one issue where Kamala Harris has run away from Joe Biden's record. Think about this. If you're trying to employ slave laborers in China at $3 a day, you're going to do that and undercut the wages of American workers unless our country stands up for itself and says you're not accessing our markets unless you're paying middle class Americans a fair wage.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, your time is up. Norah.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Thank you. Now to the issue of reproductive rights. Governor Walz, after Roe v. Wade was overturned, you signed a bill into law that made Minnesota one of the least restrictive states in the nation when it comes to abortion. Former President Trump said in the last debate that. You believe abortion, quote, in the 9th month is absolutely fine. Yes or no? Is that what you support? I'll give you two minutes.\\nTIM WALZ: That's not what the bill says. But look, this issue is what's on everyone's mind. Donald Trump put this all into motion. He brags about how great it was that he put the judges in and overturned Roe versus Wade, 52 years of personal autonomy. And then he tells us, oh, we send it to the states. It's a beautiful thing. Amanda Zaworski would disagree with you on it's a beautiful thing. A young bride in Texas waiting for their child at 18 weeks. She has a complication, a tear in the membrane. She needs to go in. The medical care at that point needs to be decided by the doctor. And that would have been an abortion. But in Texas, that would have put them in legal jeopardy. She went home, got sepsis, nearly dies, and now she may have difficulty having children. Or in Kentucky, Hadley Duvall, a twelve year old child raped and impregnated by her stepfather. Those are horrific. Now, when got asked about that, Senator Vance said, two wrongs don't make a right. There is no right in this. So in Minnesota, what we did was restore Roe v. Wade. We made sure that we put women in charge of their health care. But look, this is not what, if you don't know Amanda or a Hadley, you soon will. Their Project 2025 is going to have a registry of pregnancies. It's going to make it more difficult, if not impossible to get contraception and limit access, if not eliminate access to infertility treatments. For so many of you out there listening, me included, infertility treatments are why I have a child. That's nobody else's business. But those things are being proposed, and the catchall on this is, is, well, the states will decide what's right for Texas might not be right for Washington. That's not how this works. This is basic human right. We have seen maternal mortality skyrocket in Texas, outpacing many other countries in the world. This is about health care. In Minnesota, we are ranked first in health care for a reason. We trust women. We trust doctors.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Senator, do you want to respond to the governor's claim? Will you create a federal pregnancy monitoring agency?\\nJD VANCE: No, Norah, certainly we won't. And I want to talk about this issue because I know a lot of Americans care about it, and I know a lot of Americans don't agree with everything that I've ever said on this topic. And, you know, I grew up in a working class family in a neighborhood where I knew a lot of young women who had unplanned pregnancies and decided to terminate those pregnancies because they feel like they didn't have any other options. And, you know, one of them is actually very dear to me. And I know she's watching tonight, and I love you. And she told me something a couple years ago that she felt like if she hadn't had that abortion, that it would have destroyed her life because she was in an abusive relationship. And I think that what I take from that, as a Republican who proudly wants to protect innocent life in this country, who proudly wants to protect the vulnerable is that my party, we've got to do so much better of a job at earning the American People's trust back on this issue where they frankly just don't trust us. And I think that's one of the things that Donald Trump and I are endeavoring to do. I want us, as a Republican Party, to be pro-family in the fullest sense of the word. I want us to support fertility treatments. I want us to make it easier for moms to afford to have babies. I want it to make it easier for young families to afford a home so they can afford a place to raise that family. And I think there's so much that we can do on the public policy front just to give women more options. Now, of course, Donald Trump has been very clear that on the abortion policy specifically, that we have a big country and it's diverse. And California has a different viewpoint on this than Georgia. Georgia has a different viewpoint from Arizona. And the proper way to handle this, as messy as democracy sometimes is, is to let voters make these decisions, let the individual states make their abortion policy. And I think that's what makes the most sense in a very big, a very diverse, and let's be honest, sometimes a very, very messy and divided country.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Governor, would you like to respond and also answer the question about restrictions?\\nTIM WALZ: Yeah. Well, the question got asked, and Donald Trump made the accusation that wasn't true about Minnesota. Well, let me tell you about this idea that there's diverse states. There's a young woman named Amber Thurmond. She happened to be in Georgia, a restrictive state. Because of that, she had to travel a long distance to North Carolina to try and get her care. Amber Thurman died in that journey back and forth. The fact of the matter is, how can we as a nation say that your life and your rights as basic as the right to control your own body is determined on geography? There's a very real chance, had Amber Thurman lived in Minnesota, she would be alive today. That's why the restoration of Roe v. Wade. When you listen to Vice President Harris talk about this subject, and you hear me talk about it, you hear us talking exactly the same. Donald Trump is trying to figure out how to get the political right of this. I agree with a lot of what Senator Vance said about what's happening. His running mate, though, does not. And that's the problem.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Governor, your time is up. Senator, let me ask you about that. He mentioned it was, I think, referring to a national ban. In the past, you have supported a Federal ban on abortion after 15 weeks. In fact, you said if someone can't support legislation like that, quote, you are making the United States the most barbaric pro-abortion regime anywhere in the entire world. My question is, why have you changed your position?\\nJD VANCE: Well, Norah, first of all, I never supported a national ban. I did during, when I was running for Senate in 2022, talk about setting some minimum national standard. For example, we have a partial birth abortion ban in this, in place in this country at the federal level. I don't think anybody's trying to get rid of that, or at least I hope not, though I know that Democrats have taken a very radical pro-abortion stance. But, Norah, you know, one of the things that changed is in the state of Ohio, we had a referendum in 2023, and the people of Ohio voted overwhelmingly, by the way, against my position. And I think that what I learned from that, Norah, is that we've got to do a better job at winning back people's trust. So many young women would love to have families. So many young women also see an unplanned pregnancy as something that's going to destroy their livelihood, destroy their education, destroy their relationships. And we have got to earn people's trust back. And that's why Donald Trump and I are committed to pursuing pro-family policies. Making childcare more accessible, making fertility treatments more accessible, because we've got to do a better job at that. And that's what real leadership is.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Governor, your response?\\nTIM WALZ: I'm going to respond on the pro abortion piece of that. No, we're not. We're pro women. We're pro freedom to make your own choice. We know what the implications are to not be that women having miscarriages, women not getting the care, physicians feeling like they may be prosecuted for providing that care. And as far as making sure that we're educating our children and giving them options. Minnesota's a state with one of the lowest teen pregnancy rates. We understand that, too. We know that the options need to be available, and we make that true. We also make it, we're a top three state for the best place to raise children. But these two things to try and say that we're pro-children but we don't like this or, or you guys are pro abortion, that's not the case at all. We are pro freedoms for women to make their choices. And we're going, and Kamala Harris is making the case to make options for children more affordable. A $6,000 child tax credit. But we're not going to base out on the backs of making someone like Amber Thurmond drive 600 miles to try and get health care.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Senator.\\nJD VANCE: May I respond to that? First of all, Governor, I agree with you. Amber Thurmond should still be alive. And there are a lot of people who should still be alive, and I certainly wish that she was. And maybe, you're free to disagree with me on this and explain this to me, but as I read the Minnesota law that you signed into law, the statute that you signed into law, it says that a doctor who presides over an abortion, where the baby survives, the doctor is under no obligation to provide lifesaving care to a baby who survives a botched late term abortion. That is, I think, whether it's not pro choice or pro abortion, that is fundamentally barbaric. And that's why I use that word, Norah, is because some of what we've seen, do you want to force catholic hospitals to perform abortions against their will? Because Kamala Harris has supported suing catholic nuns to violate their freedom of conscience? We can be a big and diverse country where we respect people's freedom of conscience. And make the country more pro baby and pro family. But please.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Yes, Governor, please respond.\\nTIM WALZ: Look, this is one where there's always something there. This is a very simple proposition. These are women's decisions to make about their healthcare decisions and the physicians who know best when they need to do this, trying to distort the way a law is written, to try and make a point. That's not it at all.\\nJD VANCE: What was I wrong about? Governor, please tell me. What was I wrong about?\\nTIM WALZ: That is not the way the law is written. Look, I've given.\\nJD VANCE: But how.\\nTIM WALZ: I've given this advice on a lot of things that getting involved, getting, that's been misread. And it was fact checked at the last debate. But the point on this is, is there's a continuation of these guys to try and tell women or to get involved. I use this line on this. Just mind your own business on this. Things worked best when Roe v. Wade was in place. When we do a restoration of Roe, that works best. That doesn't preclude us from increasing funding for children. It doesn't increase us from making sure that once that child's born, like in Minnesota, they get meals, they get early childhood education, they get healthcare. So the hiding behind we're going to do all these other things when you're not proposing them in your budget? Kamala Harris is proposing them. She's proposing all those things to make life easier for families.\\nJD VANCE: I asked a specific question, Governor. And you gave me a slogan as a response.\\nTIM WALZ: It's not the case. It's not true. That's not what the law says. So they fact checked it with President Trump.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Gentlemen, there's a lot to discuss. We have to move on. And we're going to be right back with much more of the CBS news Vice Presidential debate in just a moment.\\nSecond Segment\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Welcome back to the CBS news Vice Presidential debate. We want to turn now to America's gun violence epidemic, the leading cause of death for children and teens in America is by firearms. Senator Vance, you oppose most gun legislation that Democrats claim would curb gun violence. You oppose red flag gun laws and legislation to ban certain semi automatic rifles, including AR-15s. So let me ask you. Earlier this year, for the first time, the parents of a school shooter were convicted of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to ten years in prison. Do you think holding parents responsible could curb mass shootings? I'll give you two minutes.\\nJD VANCE: Yeah. Well, Norah, on that particular case, I don't know the full details, but I certainly trust local law enforcement and local authorities to make those decisions. I think in some cases the answer is going to be yes, and in some cases the answer is going to be no. And the details really matter here. Of course. For example, if a kid steals a gun, that's going to be different than if a parent hands over a gun knowing that their kid is potentially dangerous. Look, I want to just sort of speak as a father of three beautiful little kids, and our oldest is now in second grade. And like a lot of parents, we send our kids to school with such hope and such joy and such pride at their little faces on the first day of school. And we know, unfortunately, that a lot of kids are going to experience this terrible epidemic of gun violence. And of course, our hearts go out to the families that are affected by this terrible stuff. And we do have to do better. And I think that Governor Walz and I actually probably agree that we need to do better on this. The question is just how do we actually do it? Now, here's something that really bothers me and worries me about this epidemic of violence. The gross majority, close to 90%, and some of the statistics I've seen of the gun violence in this country is committed with illegally obtained firearms. And while we're on that topic, we know that thanks to Kamala Harris's open border, we've seen a massive influx in the number of illegal guns run by the Mexican drug cartel. So that number, the amount of illegal guns in our country is higher today than it was three and a half years ago. But what do we do about the schools? What do we do to protect our kids? And I think the answer is, and I say this not loving the answer because I don't want my kids to go to school and a school that feels unsafe or where there are visible signs of security. But I unfortunately think that we have to increase security in our schools. We have to make the doors lock better. We have to make the doors stronger. We've got to make the windows stronger. And of course, we've got to increase school resource officers because the idea that we can magically wave a wand and take guns out of the hands of bad guys, it just doesn't fit with recent experience. So we've got to make our schools safer, and I think we've got to have some common sense, bipartisan solutions for how to do that.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Governor, you have two minutes.\\nTIM WALZ: Well, I think all the parents watching tonight, this is your biggest nightmare. Look, I got a, I got a 17 year old, and he witnessed a shooting at a community center playing volleyball. Those things don't leave you.\\nJD VANCE: Awful.\\nTIM WALZ: As a member of Congress. I sat in my office surrounded by dozens of the Sandy Oak parents, and they were looking at my seven year old picture on the wall. Their seven year old were dead. And they were asking us to do something. And look, I'm a hunter. I own firearms. The Vice President is. We understand that the Second Amendment is there, but our first responsibility is to our kids to figure this out. In Minnesota, we've enacted enhanced red flag laws, enhanced background checks, and we can start to get data. But here's the problem. If we really want to solve this, we've got folks that won't allow research to be even done on gun violence. And this idea that we should just live with it. And I, here's what I do think and this is a good start to the conversation. I 100% believe that Senator Vance hates it when these kids, it's abhorrent, and it breaks your heart. I agree with that. But that's not far enough when we know there are things that worked. I've spent time in Finland and seen some Finnish schools. They don't have this happen even though they have a high gun ownership rate in the country. There are reasonable things that we can do to make a difference. It's not infringing on your Second Amendment. And the idea to have some of these weapons out there. It just doesn't make any sense. Kamala Harris, as an Attorney General, worked on this issue. She knows that it's there. No one's trying to scaremonger and say, we're taking your guns. But I ask all of you out there, do you want your school's hardened to look like a fort? Is that what we have to go… when we know there's countries around the world that their children aren't practicing these types of drills? They're being kids. We owe it to them to get a fix. These are things that shouldn't be that difficult. You can still keep your firearms, and we can make a difference. We have to. If you're listening tonight, this breaks your heart.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Senator?\\nJD VANCE: Tim, first of all, I didn't know that your 17 year old witnessed the shooting. And I'm sorry about that. And I hope,\\nTIM WALZ: I appreciate that.\\nJD VANCE: Christ, have mercy. It is awful. And I appreciate what Tim said, actually, about Finland. 'Cause I do think it illustrates some of the, frankly weird differences between our own country's gun violence problem and Finland is. Okay, first of all, we have way higher rates of mental health abuse or mental health substance abuse. We have way higher rates of depression, way higher rates of anxiety. We, unfortunately, have a mental health crisis in this country that I really do think that we need to get to the root causes of because I don't think it's the whole reason why we have such a bad gun violence problem. But I do think it's a big piece of it. Another driver of the gun violence epidemic, especially that affecting our kids. It doesn't earn as many headlines, but is the terrible gun violence problem in a lot of our big cities. And this is why we have to empower law enforcement to arrest the bad guys, put them away, and take gun offenders off the streets. I think there's a whole host of things that we can do here, but I do think at our schools, we've got to talk about more security.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Senator, thank you. Governor, you previously opposed an assault weapons ban, but only later in your political career did you change your position. Why?\\nTIM WALZ: Yeah. I sat in that office with those Sandy Hook parents. I've become friends with school shooters. I've seen it. Look, the NRA. I was the NRA guy for a long time. They used to teach gun safety. I'm of an age where my shotgun was in my car so I could pheasant hunt after football practice. That's not where we live today. And several things I want to mention on this is talking about cities and where it's at. The number one, where the most firearm deaths happen in Minnesota are rural suicides. And we have an epidemic of children getting guns and shooting themselves. And so we have, and we should look at all of the issues, making sure folks have healthcare and all that. But I want to be very careful. This idea of stigmatizing mental health, just because you have a mental health issue doesn't mean you're violent. And I think what we end up doing is we start looking for a scapegoat. Sometimes it just is the guns. It's just the guns. And there are things that you can do about it. But I do think that this is one, and I think this is a healthy conversation. I think there's a capacity to find solutions on this that work, protect Second Amendment, protect our children. That's our priority.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Gentlemen, thank you. Margaret.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Norah. Let's turn now to the top contributor to inflation, the high cost of housing and rent. There's a shortage of more than 4 million homes in the United States and this contributes to the high housing crisis. Governor Walz, the Harris campaign promises a $25,000 down payment assistance for first time homebuyers and a $10,000 tax credit. They also promise to build 3 million new homes. Where are you building these new homes and won't handing out that kind of money just drive up prices higher?\\nTIM WALZ: No, it's not handing out. First, let me say this, this issue of housing. And I think those of you listening on this. The problem we've had is that we've got a lot of folks that see housing as another commodity. It can be bought up. It can be shifted. It can be moved around. Those are not folks living in those houses. Those of you listening tonight, that house is a big deal. I bought and owned one house in my life. My mom still lives in the house where I was. And when I think of a house, I'm thinking of Christmas services after midnight Mass, where you go with your family. We need to make it more affordable. And one of the things, as I said, this program that the Vice President is pushing forward and bringing a new way of approaching. This is something we're doing in Minnesota from that lead. We in the state invested in making sure our housing was the biggest investment that we'd ever made in housing. It starts to make it easier. We cut some of the red tape. Local folks, look, we can't do at the Federal level, but local folks make it easier to build those homes. And then that down payment assistance. I can tell all of you out there, one of the, certainly for me, using the GI bill was one thing, but a veteran's home loan, the big thing about a veteran's home loan is you don't have to pay the down payment. Those are things that make it there. Now, look, you're going to pay it back and you're going to pay your mortgage. Those are things that we know in the long run, the appreciated value, the generational wealth that's created from it. And I will give Minneapolis an example. Minneapolis is the one city where we've seen the lowest inflation rates. We've seen a 12% increase in stock because we put some of these things in. And we're implementing a state program to make sure we give some of that down payment assistance. We get it back from people, because here's what we know. People with stable housing end up with stable jobs. People with stable housing have their kids able to get to school. All of those things in the long run, end up saving our money. And that's the thing that I think we should be able to find some common ground in. But we can't blame immigrants for the only reason that's not the case that's happening in many cities. The fact of the matter is, is that we don't have enough naturally affordable housing, but we can make sure that the government's there to help kickstart it, create that, create that base.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, your time is up. Senator Vance, as far as your campaign's position, the promise is to seize federal lands to build homes, remove regulation, provide tax breaks, and cut back on immigration, which you say pushes up prices. Where are you going to build all the new homes you're promising? And what part of any of this plan will provide immediate relief? You have two minutes.\\nJD VANCE: Well, first of all, Tim just said something that I agree with. We don't want to blame immigrants for higher housing prices. But we do want to blame Kamala Harris for letting in millions of illegal aliens into this country…\\nTIM WALZ: Pass the bill.\\nJD VANCE: …which does drive up costs, Tim. Twenty-five million illegal aliens competing with Americans for scarce homes is one of the most significant drivers of home prices in the country. It's why we have massive increases in home prices that have happened right alongside massive increases in illegal alien, alien populations under Kamala Harris's leadership. Now, Tim just mentioned a bunch of ideas. Now, some of those ideas I actually think are halfway decent, and some of them I disagree with. But the most important thing here is Kamala Harris is not running as a newcomer to politics. She is the sitting Vice President. If she wants to enact all of these policies to make housing more affordable, I invite her to use the office that the American people already gave her, not sit around and campaign and do nothing while Americans find the American Dream of home ownership completely unaffordable. Now, you asked Margaret what would immediately change the equation for American citizens? If you lower energy prices. As Donald Trump says, 'Drill, baby, drill.' One of the biggest drivers of housing costs, aside from illegal immigration, is think about it: if a truck driver is paying 40% more for diesel, then the lumber he's delivering to the job site to build the house is also going to become a lot more expensive. If we open up American energy, you will get immediate pricing release, relief, for American citizens, not, by the way, just in housing, but in a whole host of other economic goods too.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Vance, you still have 23 seconds there. Do you want to answer?\\nTIM WALZ: Can I have it?\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Where, Governor, we will get to you in a moment. But, Senator, where are you going to seize the federal lands. Can you clarify?\\nJD VANCE: Well, what Donald Trump has said is we have a lot of federal lands that aren't being used for anything. They're not being used for national parks. They're not being used. And they could be places where we build a lot of housing. And I do think that we should be opening up building in this country. We have a lot of land that could be used. We have a lot of Americans that need homes. We should be kicking out illegal immigrants who are competing for those homes, and we should be building more homes for the American citizens who deserve to be here.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, your time is up. Governor, I do want to let you respond to the allegation that the Vice President is letting in migrants\\nTIM WALZ: Well, of course, that's not true. And again, you have the facts. I guess we agreed not to fact check. I'll check it. That, look, crossings are down compared to when Donald Trump left office. But it's, again, blaming and not trying to find the solution. I was going to ask, though, on this question, are we going to drill and build houses in the same federal land. And I think when people hear federal lands, these are really important pieces of land. Now, Minnesota doesn't have a lot of federal lands. I know in the western part of the countries we do. There's not a lot of federal lands in and around Minneapolis, for example. So the issue is, I don't understand the federal lands issue unless we see this. And I worry about this as someone who cares deeply about our national parks and our federal lands. Look, Minnesota, we protect these things. We've got about 20% of the world's fresh water. These lands protect. They're there for a reason. They belong to all of us. But again, this is when you view housing and you view these things as commodities, like there's a chance to make money here. Let's take this federal land and let's sell it to people for that. I think there's better ways to do this. We've seen it in Minnesota. We're able to refurbish some of these houses. We're able to make some investments, that gets people in. And I'm still on the fact, on this, economist, Senator Vance, you said you don't like the economist, which economists are saying that it is immigrants that's adding to the cost.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, governor, your time is, your time is up.\\nTIM WALZ: Sorry.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But, Senator, on that point, I'd like for you to clarify. There are many contributing factors to high housing costs. What evidence do you have that migrants are part of this problem?\\nJD VANCE: Well, there's a Federal Reserve study that we're happy to share after the debate. We'll put it up on social media. Actually, that really drills down on the connection between increased levels of migration, especially illegal immigration, and higher housing prices. Now, of course, Margaret, that's not the entire driver of higher housing prices. It's also the regulatory regime of Kamala Harris. Look, we are a country of builders. We're a country of doers. We're a country of explorers. But we increasingly have a Federal administration that makes it harder to develop our resources, makes it harder to build things, and wants to throw people in jail for not doing everything exactly as Kamala Harris says that they have to do. And what that means is that you have a lot of people who would love to build homes who aren't able to build homes. I actually agree with Tim Walz. We should get out of this idea of housing as a commodity. But the thing that has most turned housing into a commodity is giving it away to millions upon millions of people who have no legal right to be here.\\nTIM WALZ: What are the federal regulations? I deal with this as a Governor.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You can very quickly reply.\\nTIM WALZ: I'm sorry. I get this as a Governor, and I don't necessarily disagree with that, that in some cases, many of those are local, many of them are state. I don't know which ones are federal, but I think whenever we talk regulations, people think they can get rid of them. I think you want to be able to get out of your house in a fire. I think you want to make sure that it's fireproof and those types of things. So which are the regulations? Because the vice president's not responsible for those. Congress writes those.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, thank you, gentlemen. We have a lot to get through. You're passionate about the housing crisis. I can tell. But Norah?\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Thank you. One of the top problems facing Americans is the high cost of health care. Senator Vance, at the last Presidential debate, former President Trump was asked about replacing the Affordable Care act. In response, he said, I have concepts of a plan. Since then, Senator, you've talked about changing how chronically ill Americans get health insurance. Can you explain how that would work? And can you guarantee that Americans with pre-existing conditions won't pay more? I'll give you two minutes.\\nJD VANCE: Well, of course, we're going to cover Americans with pre-existing conditions. In fact, a lot of my family members have gotten health care, I believe, you know, members of my family actually got private health insurance, at least, for the first time, switched off of Medicaid onto private insurance for the first time, under Donald Trump's leadership. And I think that, you know, a lot of people have criticized this 'concepts of a plan' remark. I think it's very simple common sense. I think, as Tim Walz knows from twelve years in Congress, you're not going to propose a 900 page bill standing on a debate stage. It would bore everybody to tears and it wouldn't actually mean anything because part of this is the give and take of bipartisan negotiation. Now, when Donald Trump was actually President, and again, he has a record to be proud of, prescription drugs fell in 2018 for the first time in a very long time. Under Kamala Harris's leadership, prescription drugs are up about 7%. Under Donald Trump's entire four years, they were up about one and a half percent. He introduced pricing transparency. Think about healthcare. You go into a hospital, you try to buy something, and nobody knows what it actually costs. That price transparency will actually give American consumers a little bit more choice and will also drive down costs. And we talked about, you know, the reinsurance regulations is what I was talking about. Look, Donald Trump has said that if we allow states to experiment a little bit on how to cover both the chronically ill, but the non chronically ill. It's not just a plan. He actually implemented some of these regulations when he was President of the United States. And I think you can make a really good argument that it salvaged Obamacare, which was doing disastrously until Donald Trump came along. I think this is an important point about President Trump. Of course, you don't have to agree with everything that President Trump has ever said or ever done, but when Obamacare was crushing under the weight of its own regulatory burden and healthcare costs, Donald Trump could have destroyed the program. Instead, he worked in a bipartisan way to ensure that Americans had access to affordable care. It's not perfect, of course, and there's so much more that we can do. But I think that Donald Trump has earned the right to put in place some better healthcare policies. He's earned it because he did it successfully the first time.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Governor.\\nTIM WALZ: All right, here's where being an old guy gives you some history. I was there at the creation of the ACA, and the reason it was so important is I come from a major healthcare state, home of the Mayo Clinic, home to Medical Alley, 3M, Medtronic, all of those. We understand healthcare. It's why we're ranked first on affordability and accessibility and quality of health care. And so what I know is under Kamala Harris, more people are covered than they have before. Those of you listening, this is critical to you. Now, Donald Trump all of a sudden wants you… go back and remember this. He ran on, the first thing he was going to do on day one, was to repeal Obamacare. On day one, he tried to sign an executive order to repeal the ACA. He signed onto a lawsuit to repeal the ACA, but lost at the Supreme Court. And he would have repealed the ACA had it not been for the courage of John McCain to save that bill. Now fast forward. What that means to you is you lose your pre-existing conditions if you're sitting at home and you got asthma, too bad. If you're a woman, probably not. Broke your foot during football, might kick you out. Your kids get kicked out when they're 26. Kamala Harris negotiated drug prices for the first time with Medicare. We have ten drugs that will come online, the most common ones that'll be there. But look, this issue, and when Donald Trump said, 'I've got a concept of a plan,' it cracked me up as a fourth grade teacher because my kids would have never given me that. But what Senator Vance just explained might be worse than a concept, because what he explained is pre-Obamacare. And I'll make this as simple as possible because I have done this for a long time. What they're saying is if you're healthy, why should you be paying more? So what they're going to do is let insurance companies pick who they insure. Because guess what happens? You pay your premium. It's not much. They figure they're not going to have to pay out to you. But those of you a little older, gray, you know, got cancer? You're going to get kicked out of it. That's why the system didn't work. Kamala Harris will protect and enhance the ACA.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Governor, thank you. Senator, you have not yet explained how you would protect people with preexisting conditions, or laid out that plan.\\nJD VANCE: Well, look, we currently have laws and regulations in place, in place right now that protect people with preexisting conditions. We want to keep those regulations in place, but we also want to make the health insurance marketplace function a little bit better. Now, what Governor Walz just said is actually not true. A lot of what happened and the reason that Obamacare was crushing under its own weight is that a lot of young and healthy people were leaving the exchanges. Donald Trump actually helped address that problem, and he did so in a way that preserved people's access to coverage who had preexisting conditions. But again, something that these guys do, is they make a lot of claims about if Donald Trump becomes President, all of these terrible consequences are going to ensue. But in reality, Donald Trump was President. Inflation was low, take home pay was higher, and he saved the very program from a Democratic administration that was collapsing and would have collapsed absent his leadership. He did his job, which is govern in a bipartisan way and get results, not just complain about problems, but actually solve them.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Governor, did enrollment under the Affordable Care Act go up under the Trump Administration?\\nTIM WALZ: It's higher now that we've seen it go up. Look, people are using it. The system works. And the question about this of young people or whatever, that's the individual mandate piece of this. And Republicans fought tooth and nail, saying, well, Americans should be free to do this. Well, then what happens?\\nJD VANCE: You think the individual mandate's a good idea?\\nTIM WALZ: I think the idea of making sure the risk pool is broad enough to cover everyone, that's the only way insurance works. When it doesn't, it collapses. You are asking pre-ACA where we get people out. Look, people know that they need to be on healthcare. People expect it to be there. And when we are able to make it, and we are making it this way, when we incentivize people to be in the market, when we help people who might not be able to afford it get there, and we make sure then when you get sick and old, it's there for you. Because I heard people say, well, I don't want to buy into Medicare or whatever. Good luck buying healthcare once you get past 70. So look, the ACA works. We can continue to do better. Kamala Harris did that. The way she made everything better was negotiating those ten drugs on Medicare for the first time in American history.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Thank you. Margaret?\\nJD VANCE: Can I address that?\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: We're, I apologize. We're out of time. We have a number of subjects to discuss. Margaret?\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Let's talk about families in America. There is a childcare crisis in this country, and the United States is one of the very few developed countries in the world without a national paid leave program for new parents. Governor Walz, you said that if Democrats win both the White House and Congress, this is a day one priority for you. How long should employers be required to pay workers while they are home taking care of their newborns? You have two minutes.\\nTIM WALZ: Yeah, well, that's negotiable. And that's what Congress worked. But here's what the deal is. Americans sitting out there right now, you may work for a big company. Look, we're home in Minnesota to some of the largest Fortune 500 companies. Kamala Harris knows that in California. Those companies provide paid family medical leave. One is, I think they're moral and they think it's a good thing, but it also keeps their employees healthy. We in Minnesota passed a paid family medical leave. You have a child. You, and I had to go back to work five days after my kids were born. This allows you to stay home a certain amount of time. What we know is that gets the child off to a better start. The family works better. We stay in their employers. We get more consistency in that. So Kamala Harris has made it a priority. We implemented it in Minnesota, and we see growth. That's how you become a pro-business state. But the negotiations on it, and here's the issue, those big companies are able to offer it. Those of you out there who don't have it, just imagine what happens if you get cancer or your child gets sick. We know what happens. You end up staying home. In some places, that means no paycheck, because you've got no protection on that. This is the case of an economy that Donald Trump has set for the wealthiest amongst us. He's willing to give those tax breaks to the wealthiest, he's willing to say, 'Bust those unions up. Do whatever.' What we're saying is the economy works best when it works for all of us. And so a paid family medical leave program, and I will tell you, go to the families or go to the businesses and ask them. As far as childcare on this, you have to take it at both the supply and the demand side. You can't expect the most important people in our lives to take care of our children or our parents, to get paid the least amount of money. And we have to make it easier for folks to be able to get into that business and then to make sure that folks are able to pay for that. We were able to do it in Minnesota, and I'm still telling you this, we were listed as the best state. We're still in crisis on this. A Federal program of paid family medical leave and help with this will enhance our workforce, enhance our families, and make it easier to have the children that you want.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, your time is up. Senator, do you support a national paid leave program? And if so, for how long should employers be mandated to pay their employees while they are home taking care of their newborn? You have two minutes.\\nJD VANCE: Yeah. Well, first of all, Margaret, a number of my Republican colleagues and some Democrats, too, have worked on this issue, and I think there is a bipartisan solution here because a lot of us care about this issue. I mean, look, I speak from this very personally because I'm married to a beautiful woman who is an incredible mother to our three beautiful kids, but is also a very, very brilliant corporate litigator, and I'm so proud of her. But being a working mom, even for somebody with all of the advantages of my wife, is extraordinarily difficult. And it's not just difficult from a policy perspective. She actually had access to paid family leave because she worked for a bigger company. But the cultural pressure on young families, and especially young women, I think, makes it really hard for people to choose the family model they want. A lot of young women would like to go back to work immediately. Some would like to spend a little time home with the kids. Some would like to spend longer at home with the kids. We should have a family care model that makes choice possible. And I think this is a very important substantive difference between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris's approach. I mean, look, if you look at the Federal programs that we have that support paid family leave right now, the community development block grant, and there's another block grant program that spends a lot of money from the federal government. These programs only go to one kind of childcare model. Let's say you'd like your church, maybe, to help you out with child care. Maybe you live in a rural area or an urban area, and you'd like to get together with families in your neighborhood to provide childcare in the way that makes the most sense. You don't get access to any of these federal monies. We want to promote choice in how we deliver family care and how we promote childcare because, look, it is unacceptable. And, you know, of course, Tim and I have been on the campaign trail a lot the past seven or eight weeks. And one of the biggest complaints I hear from young families is people who feel like they don't have options, like they're choosing between going to work or taking care for their kids. That is an incredible burden to put on American families. We're the only country that does it. I think we could do a heck of a lot better.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you. You have also said, Senator Vance, many things about the American family. The Federal Reserve says parents will spend nearly as much on childcare as they do on housing each month. So I want to get your thoughts on this. President Trump recently said, as much as child care is talked about as being expensive, it's, relatively speaking, not very expensive compared to the kinds of numbers we'll be taking in. Is President Trump committed to the $5,000 per child tax credit that you have described? You have 1 minute.\\nJD VANCE: Well, what President Trump said, Margaret, I just want to defend my running mate here a little bit, is that we're going to be taking in a lot of money by penalizing companies for shipping jobs overseas and penalizing countries who employ slave laborers and then ship their products back into our country and undercut the wages of American workers. It's the heart of the Donald Trump economic plan. Cut taxes for American workers and American families. Cut taxes for businesses that are hiring and building companies in the United States of America. But penalize companies and countries that are shipping jobs overseas. That's the heart of the economic proposal. And I think what President Trump is saying is that when we bring in this additional revenue with higher economic growth, we're going to be able to provide paid family leave, childcare options that are viable and workable for a lot of American families.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Can you clarify how that will solve the childcare shortage?\\nJD VANCE: Well, because, as Tim said, a lot of the childcare shortages, we just don't have enough resources going into the multiple people who could be providing family care options. And we're going to have to, unfortunately, look, we're going to have to spend more money. We're going to have to induce more people to want to provide child care options for American families because the reason it's so expensive right now is because you've got way too few people providing this very essential service.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Senator. Governor Walz, your ticket also has some childcare tax credit proposals. Do you think Congress will agree to the $6,000 credit for newborns and $3,000 credit for children over the age of six, as your campaign has promised? Is that realistic?\\nTIM WALZ: Well, well, if these members of Congress are listening to anybody, I can tell you, and this is the biggest issue everybody listening tonight knows. I mean, I'm sure they were shocked to hear it's not that expensive. And let's be clear whether it's $5000 or $6000, that pays you about three or four months. Let's be clear of where we're at on this. It's because we got out of an imbalance on this. We thought we were going to get by by not paying people. I don't think Senator Vance and I are that far apart. I'm not opposed to what he's talking about on options. We've done scholarships, types of things. I think we need to be open to making the case. But the issue here is, the question you asked is you're not going to pay for it with these tariffs. That's just adding another $4,000 on the family and taking less. So not only do they not get the money to pay for that, they're $4,000 in the hole. That's Wharton School. That's his alma mater. And so I think the issue here is those members of Congress, I can't believe they're not here. When I go to businesses, sure, they'll talk about taxes sometimes. But they will lead with childcare and they will lead with housing, because we know the problem is, especially in a state like Minnesota, we need more workers because our economy is growing, but we need the workforce.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, thank you. We need to move on. Norah?\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Let's talk about the State of Democracy, the top issue for Americans after the economy and inflation. After the 2020 election, President Trump's campaign and others filed 62 lawsuits contesting the results. Judges, including those appointed by President Trump and other Republican Presidents looked at the evidence and said there was no widespread fraud. The Governors of every state in the nation, Republicans and Democrats, certified the 2020 election results and sent a legal slate of electors to Congress for January 6th. Senator Vance, you have said you would not have certified the last Presidential election and would have asked the states to submit alternative electors. That has been called unconstitutional and illegal. Would you again seek to challenge this year's election results, even if every Governor certifies the results? I'll give you two minutes.\\nJD VANCE: Well, Norah, first of all, I think that we're focused on the future. We need to figure out how to solve the inflation crisis caused by Kamala Harris's policies. Make housing affordable, make groceries affordable, and that's what we're focused on. But I want to answer your question because you did ask it. Look, what President Trump has said is that there were problems in 2020. And my own belief is that we should fight about those issues, debate those issues peacefully in the public square. And that's all I've said. And that's all that Donald Trump has said. Remember, he said that on January 6th, the protesters ought to protest peacefully. And on January 20th, what happened? Joe Biden became the President. Donald Trump left the White House. And now, of course, unfortunately, we have all of the negative policies that have come from the Harris-Biden administration. I believe that we actually do have a threat to democracy in this country, but unfortunately, it's not the threat to democracy that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz want to talk about. It is the threat of censorship. It's Americans casting aside lifelong friendships because of disagreements over politics. It's big technology companies silencing their fellow citizens. And it's Kamala Harris saying that rather than debate and persuade her fellow Americans, she'd like to censor people who engage in misinformation. I think that is a much bigger threat to democracy than anything that we've seen in this country in the last four years, in the last 40 years. Now I'm really proud, especially given that I was raised by two lifelong blue collar Democrats to have the endorsement of Bobby Kennedy Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard, lifelong leaders in the democratic coalition. And of course, they don't agree with me and Donald Trump on every issue. We don't have to agree on every issue, but we're united behind a basic American First Amendment principle that we ought to debate our differences. We ought to argue about them. We ought to try to persuade our fellow Americans. Kamala Harris is engaged in censorship at an industrial scale. She did it during COVID, she's done it over a number of other issues. And that, to me, is a much bigger threat to democracy than what Donald Trump said when he said that protesters should peacefully protest on January 6th.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor.\\nTIM WALZ: Well, I've enjoyed tonight's debate, and I think there was a lot of commonality here. And I'm sympathetic to misspeaking on things. And I think I might have with the Senator, but…\\nJD VANCE: Me too, man.\\nTIM WALZ: There's one, there's one, though, that this one is troubling to me. And I say that because I think we need to tell the story. Donald Trump refused to acknowledge this. And the fact is, is that I don't think we can be the frog in the pot and let the boiling water go up. He was very clear. I mean, he lost this election, and he said he didn't. One hundred and forty police officers were beaten at the Capitol that day, some with the American flag. Several later died. And it wasn't just in there. In Minnesota, a group gathered on the state capitol grounds in St. Paul and said we're marching to the Governor's residence and there may be casualties. The only person there was my son and his dog, who was rushed out crying by state police. That issue. And Mike Pence standing there as they were chanting, hang Mike Pence. Mike Pence made the right decision. So, Senator, it was adjudicated over and over and over. I worked with kids long enough to know, and I said, as a football coach, sometimes you really want to win, but the democracy is bigger than winning an election. You shake hands and then you try and do everything you can to help the other side win. That's, that's what was at stake here. Now, the thing I'm most concerned about is the idea that imprisoning your political opponents already laying the groundwork for people not accepting this. And a President's words matter. A President's words matter. People hear that. So I think this issue of settling our differences at the ballot box, shaking hands when we lose, being honest about it, but to deny what happened on January 6, the first time in American history that a President or anyone tried to overturn a fair election and the peaceful transfer of power. And here we are four years later in the same boat. I will tell you this, that when this is over, we need to shake hands, this election, and the winner needs to be the winner. This has got to stop. It's tearing our country apart.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Margaret.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Vance, did you want to respond to that?\\nJD VANCE: Yeah, well, look, Tim, first of all, it's really rich for Democratic leaders to say that Donald Trump is a unique threat to democracy when he peacefully gave over power on January the 20th, as we have done for 250 years in this country. We are going to shake hands after this debate and after this election. And of course, I hope that we win, and I think we're going to win. But if Tim Walz is the next vice president, he'll have my prayers, he'll have my best wishes, and he'll have my help whenever he wants it. But we have to remember that for years in this country, Democrats protested the results of elections. Hillary Clinton in 2016 said that Donald Trump had the election stolen by Vladimir Putin because the Russians bought, like, $500,000 worth of Facebook ads. This has been going on for a long time. And if we want to say that we need to respect the results of the election, I'm on board. But if we want to say, as Tim Walz is saying, that this is just a problem that Republicans have had. I don't buy that.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Governor.\\nTIM WALZ: January 6th was not Facebook ads. And I think a revisionist history on this. Look, I don't understand how we got to this point, but the issue was that happened. Donald Trump can even do it. And all of us say there's no place for this. It has massive repercussions. This idea that there's censorship to stop people from doing, threatening to kill someone, threatening to do something, that's not censorship. Censorship is book banning. We've seen that. We've seen that brought up. I just think for everyone tonight, and I'm going to thank Senator Vance. I think this is the conversation they want to hear, and I think there's a lot of agreement. But this is one that we are miles apart on. This was a threat to our democracy in a way that we had not seen. And it manifested itself because of Donald Trump's inability to say, he is still saying he didn't lose the election. I would just ask that. Did he lose the 2020 election?\\nJD VANCE: Tim, I'm focused on the future. Did Kamala Harris censor Americans from speaking their mind in the wake of the 2020 COVID situation?\\nTIM WALZ: That is a damning. That is a damning non answer.\\nJD VANCE: It's a damning non answer for you to not talk about censorship. Obviously, Donald Trump and I think that there were problems in 2020. We've talked about it. I'm happy to talk about it further. But you guys attack us for not believing in democracy. The most sacred right under the United States democracy is the First Amendment. You yourself have said there's no First Amendment right to misinformation. Kamala Harris wants to use the power of government and big tech to silence people from speaking their minds. That is a threat to democracy that will long outlive this present political moment. I would like Democrats and Republicans to both reject censorship. Let's persuade one another. Let's argue about ideas, and then let's come together afterwards.\\nTIM WALZ: You can't yell fire in a crowded theater. That's the test. That's the Supreme court test.\\nJD VANCE: Tim. Fire in a crowded theater. You guys wanted to kick people off of Facebook for saying that toddlers should not wear masks.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Senator, the governor does have the floor.\\nTIM WALZ: Sorry.\\nJD VANCE: That's not fire in a crowded theater. That is criticizing the policies of the government, which is the right of every American.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Senator, the governor does have the floor for 1 minute to respond to you.\\nTIM WALZ: Please. Yeah, well, I don't run Facebook. What I do know is I see a candidate out there who refused, and now again. And this, I'm pretty shocked by this. He lost the election. This is not a debate. It's not anything anywhere other than in Donald Trump's world, because, look, when Mike Pence made that decision to certify that election, that's why Mike Pence isn't on this stage. What I'm concerned about is where is the firewall with Donald Trump? Where is the firewall if he knows he could do anything, including taking an election and his Vice President's not going to stand to it. That's what we're asking you, America. Will you stand up? Will you keep your oath of office even if the President doesn't? And I think Kamala Harris would agree. She wouldn't have picked me if she didn't think I would do that because, of course, that's what we would do. So, America, I think you've got a really clear choice on this election of who's going to honor that democracy and who's going to honor Donald Trump.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, your time is up. Thank you, gentlemen. We will be right back with both of our candidates. The CB's news vice presidential debate continues.\\nSegment 3\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Welcome back to the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. It is now time for the closing statement. Senator Vance won the virtual coin toss and elected to go last. So, Governor Walz, you are first. You have two minutes.\\nTIM WALZ: Well, thank you, Senator Vance. Thank you to CBS News. And most importantly, thank you to all of you. If you're still up and the folks who miss Dancing with the Stars, I appreciate it. But look, the support of the democracy matters. It matters that you're here. And I'm as surprised as anybody of this coalition that Kamala Harris has built. From Bernie Sanders to Dick Cheney to Taylor Swift and a whole bunch of folks in between there. And they don't all agree on everything, but they are truly optimistic people. They believe in a positive future of this country. And one where our politics can be better than it is. And I have to tell you that, that better than it is is the sense of optimism that there can be an opportunity economy that works for everyone, not just to get by, but to get ahead. And the idea that freedom really means something. Not the freedom of government to be in your bedroom or exam room, but the freedom for you to make choices about yourself. Now, look, we all know who Donald Trump is. He's told us. And as Maya Angelou said, 'Believe him when he told you that.' His first inaugural address talked about American carnage and then he spent four years trying to maybe do that. Senator Vance tonight made it clear he will stand with Donald Trump's agenda. He will continue to push down that road. Excuse me. Kamala Harris gives us a different option. Now, I have to tell you, I'm going to be careful about the quotes, but there's one that Senator Vance said that does resonate with me. He said, 'Donald Trump makes the people I care about afraid.' A lot of America feels that way. We don't need to be afraid. Franklin Roosevelt was right. 'All we have to fear is fear itself.' Kamala Harris is bringing us a new way forward. She's bringing us a politics of joy. She's bringing real solutions for the middle class. And she's centering you at the heart of that, all the while asking everyone, 'Join this movement. Make your voices heard. Let's look for a new day where everybody gets that opportunity and everybody gets a chance to thrive.' I humbly ask for your vote on November 5 for Kamala Harris.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor Walz. Thank you. Senator Vance, your closing statement.\\nJD VANCE: Well, I want to thank Governor Walz, you folks at CBS and, of course, the American people for tuning in this evening. And one of the issues we didn't talk about was energy. And I remember when I was being raised by my grandmother, when she didn't have enough money to turn on the heat some nights because Ohio gets pretty cold at night and because money was often very tight. And I believe, as a person who wants to be your next Vice President, that we are a rich and prosperous enough country where every American, whether they're rich or poor, ought to be able to turn on their heat in the middle of a cold winter night. That's gotten more difficult thanks to Kamala Harris's energy policies. I believe that whether you're rich or poor, you ought to be able to afford a nice meal for your family. That's gotten harder because of Kamala Harris's policies. I believe that whether you're rich or poor you ought to be able to afford to buy a house. You ought to be able to live in safe neighborhoods. You ought to not have your communities flooded with fentanyl. And that, too, has gotten harder with Kamala, because of Kamala Harris's policies. Now, I've been in politics long enough to do what Kamala Harris does when she stands before the American people and says that on day one she's gonna work on all these challenges I just listed. She's been the Vice President for three and a half years. Day one was 1400 days ago. And her policies have made these problems worse. Now I believe that we have the most beautiful country in the world. I meet people on the campaign trail who can't afford food, but have the grace and generosity to ask me how I'm doing and to tell me they're praying for my family. What that has taught me is that we have the greatest country, the most beautiful country, the most incredible people anywhere in the world. But they're not going to be able to achieve their full dreams with the broken leadership that we have in Washington. They're not going to be able to live their American Dream if we do the same thing that we've been doing for the last three and a half years. We need change. We need a new direction. We need a President who has already done this once before and did it well. Please vote for Donald Trump. And whether you vote for me or vote for Tim Walz, I just want to say I'm so proud to be doing this, and I'm rooting for you. God bless you and good night.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Vance, thank you. And thank you both for participating in the only Vice Presidential debate of this election cycle. I'm Margaret Brennan.\",\n",

       "   'summary': 'The ACLU on Wednesday sued for information about the federal government\\'s capacity to massively detain and deport immigrants.\\nThe lawsuit comes during a U.S. election season in which immigration has been central to the presidential campaign. Republican Donald Trump has promised a \"mass deportation\" of unauthorized immigrants, while Democrat Kamala Harris has pushed for tougher restrictions on asylum seekers at the border.\\n\"If a mass deportation and detention system ends up being established by a future administration, we have many concerns about how that could impact the civil rights and civil liberties of immigrants,\" said Kyle Virgien, senior staff attorney at the ACLU\\'s National Prison Project.\\nIn the complaint filed in the U.S. Southern District of New York, the ACLU claims the federal government spends billions each year to fund detention and deportation infrastructure, yet \"much of the specific information about how this detention and deportation apparatus operates is unavailable to the public.\"\\nThe ACLU first sought documents under the Freedom of Information Act in August, but the requests went unanswered, Virgien said.\\nThe lawsuit targets the Department of Homeland Security and agencies under its purview including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Border Patrol, as well as the Department of Justice. USA TODAY has reached out to DHS and DOJ for comment on the lawsuit.\\nA mass deportation effort to remove 1 million people per year could cost $88 billion annually, according new research by the nonpartisan American Immigration Council. It could take 10 years to deport the unauthorized population in the U.S. and could cost more than $900 billion in total, the council said in its report.\\nThere are roughly 11 million unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S., according to estimates by the Pew Research Center.\\nOn its website, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, lists 91 detention facilities nationwide that it operates or uses, including federal \"processing centers\" and detention centers, as well as county jails, where apprehended immigrants may be held in the custody of the U.S. Marshals.\\nBut a 2018 report by the American Immigration Council found that ICE relied on many more detention facilities. The organization said ICE detained people at 630 sites and that \"individuals detained by ICE were commonly held in privately operated and remotely located facilities, far away from basic community support structures and legal advocacy networks.\"\\nAs of Sept. 8, ICE held 37,395 immigrants in detention, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, which seeks federal records through standing FOIA requests. Sixty percent of immigrants held in ICE detention had no criminal record, according to TRAC.\\nICE states on its website that \"detention is non-punitive\" and that detention facilities owned or operated by ICE, by a state or local entity or government contractor \"must comply with one of several sets of detention standards.\"\\nInvestigations by USA TODAY and others have repeatedly found issues with medical care in detention, access to legal representation and complications associated with detaining families.\\nThe ACLU is seeking records that demonstrate the government\\'s capacity to detain, house and transport immigrants. The lawsuit asks for information on ICE\\'s maximum bed space, including under hotel contracts; DHS\\' ability to transfer its personnel from one sub-agency to another; the department\\'s ground transportation capabilities, among other records.\\nMore: ICE paid $17 million for migrant hotel rooms that went unused, watchdog says\\nIf the next administration decides to increase immigrant detention and deportations, \"we worry that there would be a lot of real problems with how it ramps up,\" Virgien said.',\n",

I never thought I\\'d need disability insurance,\\'\" said Victor.\\nMental health coverage appears to be locked in a time warp. Here are some key questions and answers.\\nWhen someone has a physical illness that impairs their ability to work, they can apply for long-term disability coverage after they\\'ve been out of work for 90 to 180 days — typically a process that follows short-term disability coverage.\\nIf approved, that person can receive a portion of their income up until retirement age.\\nWhen someone struggling with a behavioral health condition applies for long-term disability coverage, however, they face a much higher rate of refusal, and even if approved, can only be compensated for 24 months.\\nMore:Physically disabled? No problem. Mentally disabled? Coverage is limited, harder to get.\\nMore:You have a mental health disability. You need coverage and work time off. Brace yourself.\\nAnd, as long as they\\'re with the same employer, the time off accumulates. For example, someone who took three months off this year would only have 21 months left for as long as they\\'re with their employer.\\nAdditionally, if someone with physical ailments has secondary mental health symptoms — say, depression that comes from having chronic back pain — that too may trigger the 24-month limitation.\\nNationally, it\\'s estimated that 7% to 8% of all long-term disability claims are related to mental health, according to a testimony provided by Richard Leavitt, a consulting actuary at the Smith Group, a disability reinsurance risk manager and consultant.\\nCompanies aren\\'t obligated to disclose such data. However, reports from the few companies that do release data, such as Sedgwick, a third-party claims administrator, indicate mental health claims are nearly twice as likely to be denied as other claims.\\nA nationwide shortage of psychiatrists certainly impacts someone\\'s chances. More than 150 million people live in federally designated mental health professional shortage areas, which makes it difficult to be assessed adequately.\\nBut for those who have a mental health professional, other problems arise. Insurers can hire mental health specialists to peer-review someone\\'s medical documents, and that assessment can override a claimant\\'s team of specialists. Mark DeBofsky, principal attorney at DeBofsky Law in Chicago and a member of the 2023 ERISA Advisory Panel, said that even if a medical professional is hired by an insurer and makes an inaccurate determination, there\\'s very little recourse.\\n\"They don\\'t face any potential malpractice liability. In this instance, they\\'re just giving an opinion,\" DeBofsky said. \"And there\\'s no accountability for having that opinion.\"\\nFor people appealing the denial of their claims for mental health or addiction, insurers almost always have the upper hand because of \"discretionary clauses,\" Victor said. In essence, insurance companies are allowed to interpret the provisions of their plans and determine eligibility as they see fit.\\nThe role of a judge in these cases, Victor said, isn\\'t to determine whether someone has a disabling condition and should have been paid benefits. Instead, it comes down to whether the insurance company was reasonable in how it interpreted its own policies.\\n\"It gives the benefit of the doubt to the insurance company\\'s decision, even if a judge disagrees with the decision,\" Victor said. \"If they can\\'t prove that the decision was unreasonable, it has to be upheld.\"\\nDiscretionary clauses have been banned in 20 states. Wisconsin, however, is not one of them.\\nAs the Journal Sentinel continues to investigate and flesh out its series, \"The Nervous Limitation,\" we want to hear from those in Wisconsin who have been impacted by insurers\\' denying them disability coverage.

       "   'excerpt': 'A report by the Wisconsin Policy Forum explores what it would mean if Wisconsin expanded Medicaid coverage to more low-income adults.',\n",
       "   'summary': 'A new report by the Wisconsin Policy Forum underscores the hundreds of millions in yearly savings Wisconsin stands to gain if it expands Medicaid eligibility, a proposal that for years has been a political nonstarter with Republican lawmakers but could become possible if control of the state Legislature shifts.\\nWisconsin is one of 10 states that has not expanded Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, to provide health coverage to adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level.\\nBadgerCare Plus is the largest Medicaid program in Wisconsin and provides health insurance to more than 900,000 low-income residents, more than half of them children. An expansion would add as many as 90,000 people to the program and would unlock additional federal funding.\\nThe report by the Wisconsin Policy Forum does not take a position on expanding Medicaid but pointed to the estimated $1.7 billion in savings an expansion would deliver the state over two years. It also found that most Wisconsinites in the income range that would be covered by the expansion already have health insurance and that expansion would add a relatively small number of uninsured people to the state\\'s rolls.\\nThe Republican-led Legislature has repeatedly rejected calls from Democrats to expand Medicaid coverage and contended that the federal government could shift more of the cost to states, that BadgerCare Plus pays hospitals and other health care providers less than commercial health plans and that expanding eligibility would discourage people from working and keep them \"trapped\" in poverty.\\nBut if control of the state Legislature shifts, it could open a door to Medicaid expansion. For the first time in more than a decade, Democrats have a realistic chance of winning control of one or both chambers of the state Legislature, now that new legislative maps are in place.\\nThe maps replace gerrymandered ones that for more than a decade delivered lopsided majorities to Republicans, even in bad election years for the GOP.\\nHere\\'s a few takeaways from the Wisconsin Policy Forum\\'s report.\\nThe report pointed to recent projections from the state Department of Health Services, which in its latest budget request estimated the state would save $1.7 billion over the next two-year budget cycle if it expanded Medicaid coverage.\\nMost of that savings would be in one-time funds, but a portion of it — several hundred million dollars — would be savings that the state would continue to reap on an ongoing basis, beyond the next budget cycle.\\nThe federal American Rescue Plan Act offers one-time bonus payments to states that newly expand Medicaid coverage. The payments would total nearly $1.3 billion in additional federal funds for Wisconsin over the two years beginning July 1 of next year, according to the state Department of Health Services.\\nThe rest of the savings — about $400,000 over the two years — would come from the federal government picking up a larger share of the costs for a segment of the Medicaid population.\\nMedicaid costs are shared by the state and federal government, with federal taxpayers picking up about 60% of costs in Wisconsin.\\nUnder an expansion, the federal government would cover a higher share of the Medicaid costs for childless adults in Wisconsin: 90% instead of the typical 60%.\\nThat savings would be ongoing. The report did not give an estimate for how much money per year the state would save after the 2025-27 biennium.\\nWisconsin has the 10th lowest uninsured rate in the country, with about 5% of residents not covered by health insurance, according to the report.\\nThat\\'s partly due to Wisconsin\\'s partial expansion of Medicaid eligibility in 2014 under Republican Gov. Scott Walker\\'s administration. That partial expansion allowed nearly all adults with household incomes at or below the federal poverty level to qualify for BadgerCare Plus, the state\\'s largest Medicaid program. Of the 10 states that have not fully expanded Medicaid, Wisconsin is the only one that covers adults making all the way up to the poverty level.\\nAs a result, Wisconsin does not have a coverage gap where some low-income adults have no option for public health insurance — the only non-expansion state with that distinction. Most adults with incomes up to the poverty level — $15,060 for an individual, and $31,200 for a family of four — qualify for BadgerCare Plus. Those making just above the poverty level qualify for subsidized health insurance through the Affordable Care Act.\\nThe report points to figures from the state\\'s Legislative Fiscal Bureau that estimate state taxpayers covered more than $2 billion in Medicaid costs that would have been paid by federal taxpayers had Wisconsin fully expanded Medicaid at the first opportunity in 2014.\\nIt\\'s a point that top health officials in Democrat Gov. Tony Evers\\' administration have been trying to emphasize in recent months, as they prepare for budget deliberations.\\n\"So far we\\'ve spent $2.4 billion that would have been covered by the federal government had we expanded\" Medicaid, said Kirsten Johnson, secretary-designee of the Department of Health Services, during a panel last week hosted by Marquette University Law School.\\n\"The reality is we would have a lot more money coming into Wisconsin if we (fully) expanded Medicaid.\"\\nA decade ago, Walker and other opponents of Medicaid expansion raised doubts about whether the federal government would continue to pay states the extra money promised for expanding Medicaid. They worried that the federal government would renege on its promise and later reduce the share it was responsible for covering under the expansion.\\nIf it expanded coverage, Wisconsin would have the smallest percent change to its Medicaid enrollment of the 10 states that haven\\'t fully expanded the program, the report noted.\\nThe report cited estimates that Wisconsin would add 70,000 to 90,000 adults to its Medicaid rolls, a minority of them uninsured.\\nBy one estimate, the state\\'s uninsured population would drop by a little over 20,000 people. Others would switch from plans bought through the Obamacare marketplace to BadgerCare Plus, which generally has lower out-of-pocket costs, the report said.\\nBadgerCare Plus caps premiums and co-pays in a given month at 5% of monthly household income, the report said.\\nMedicaid expansion would extend eligibility to some Wisconsinites who are currently covered by plans sold on the marketplaces set up through the Affordable Care Act.\\nThose people benefit from federal subsidies, in the form of tax credits, that cover part or all of the monthly premium for their plan. Some of them would likely switch to BadgerCare Plus if they became eligible.\\nThat would ultimately reduce the amount in federal subsidies flowing to insurers in the state to subsidize health coverage and services here, the report says. The reduction would equal more than $280 million per year, something the report urged policymakers to consider.\\nSome hospitals and other health care providers might be negatively affected by the shift of some people from private plans to BadgerCare Plus, the report says, because Medicaid pays them lower reimbursements than commercial plans.\\nSome health care providers might be less willing to accept BadgerCare Plus patients, the report warned.\\nThe report noted that lawmakers could choose to use some of the savings from Medicaid expansion to raise reimbursement rates for health care providers.',\n",

       "   'summary': \"With abortion concerns continuing to weigh on his campaign, former President Donald Trump said Tuesday he would veto a national abortion ban if one crossed his desk as president, and his running mate JD Vance said the GOP needs to 'earn people's trust' on the issue.\\nMany states have passed strict new limits on abortion since a Supreme Court remade by Trump appointees overturned Roe v Wade, the decades-old decision protecting abortion rights.\\nTrump has praised the ruling, saying the issue should be left to the states, but has also sought to reassure voters concerned about new restrictions. Trump said during a debate last month that he would not sign a national abortion ban, but repeatedly refused to say whether he'd veto one.\\nAfter the abortion issue came up again during the vice presidential debate Tuesday, Trump declared on Truth Social that 'EVERYONE KNOWS I WOULD NOT SUPPORT A FEDERAL ABORTION BAN, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, AND WOULD, IN FACT, VETO IT.'\\nAbortion has proven a thorny issue for Trump, who has tried to distance himself from more extreme elements of his party as polls show most voters support abortion rights. He has been forced to backtrack at times, though, after backlash from the right, as when he came out recently against a ballot measure in Florida protecting abortion rights.\\nVance also sought to soften the GOP's image on abortion during Tuesday's debate. He conceded his party has a trust problem when it comes to the issue.\\nVance cited the story of a woman who is 'very dear to me' who told him 'a couple years ago that she felt like if she hadn't had that abortion that it would have destroyed her life because she was in an abusive relationship.'\\n'I think that what I take from that, as a Republican who proudly wants to protect innocent life in this country, who proudly wants to protect the vulnerable, is that my party we've got to do so much better of a job at earning the American people's trust back on this issue, where they frankly just don't trust us,' Vance said.\\nFact Check:What Tim Walz, JD Vance got right (and wrong) in VP debate\\nHe went on to argue that he and Trump are doing that by promoting pro-family policies, such as fertility treatments and helping families financially. He also defended Trump's position that abortion regulation should be left up to the states.\\nDemocratic candidate for vice president Tim Walz said that leaving abortion up to the states has put pregnant women at risk, citing the case of Amber Thurman, a Georgia woman who died after a long delay in getting a procedure to clear fetal tissue from her body that hadn't been fully expelled after she took abortion bills, according to ProPublica. A medical panel ruled Thurman's death was 'preventable.'\\nWalz said Thurman's death is the result of a basic right being 'determined by geography.'\",\n",

       "   'excerpt': 'JLR executives open up just a little about the deemphasis of the storied brand in favor of its progeny.',\n",
       "   'summary': 'What about Land Rover? Just 16 months ago, Jaguar Land Rover renamed itself JLR, expanded its two brands to four, and surprisingly, shuffled its storied Land Rover nameplate to what appears to be a mostly symbolic, ceremonial position in the new \\'House of Brands.\\' Company representatives never really explained their thinking, but MT interviews with JLR COO Lennard Hoornik and Range Rover managing director Geraldine Ingham have shed a little more light on just what exactly is happening to Land Rover.\\nFrom the start and continuing through these interviews, JLR executives have been loathe to admit Land Rover has been deemphasized or taken a back seat. They\\'re quick to point out the familiar green logo, which they\\'ve taken to calling a \\'trustmark,\\' will still appear on the vehicles and will represent core principles like off-road capability. Whether it will appear on every former Land Rover product remains to be seen, though, as Ingham explained \\'removing badges is part of our reductive design strategy.\\'\\nHoornik is more defensive. The Land Rover badge is, he says, a \\'critical mark\\' and will be \\'refined\\' going forward, not eliminated. He\\'s also quick to point out the company\\'s bourgeoning Land Rover Classic division, which is restoring classic models in-house for well-heeled owners. (Sister division Jaguar Classic is doing the same for that brand\\'s vintage models.)\\n2026 Honda Passport first look:Two-row Pilot SUV no more?\\nWhat neither will say directly is why they don\\'t believe Land Rover has the same brand equity it once had. Reducing it to a badge and a restoration shop with no clear explanation why suggests a belief it can no longer sell cars the way it used to. Supporting this hypothesis is something chief creative officer Jerry McGovern told us when the move was first announced: \\'The reality is Range Rover is already a brand. So is Defender. We love the Land Rover name, but it doesn\\'t have as much equity as Range Rover, and Defender is rising fast.\"\\nIn other words, Land Rover is old news. McGovern went on to point out \\'people tell us they drive a Range Rover, not a Land Rover.\\' Between the success of products like the Range Rover and Defender and the company\\'s long-confusing naming scheme – is it really a Land Rover Range Rover SV Autobiography LWB? Yes, technically, it is — the buying public seems to have lost interest in the Land Rover part of the name in favor of the model in their driveway, and JLR seems to see more success to be had in embracing this reality than fighting it.\\n\\'It provides some complexity,\\' Hoornik said of splitting up the brands, \\'but brings a huge amount of clarity for each brand.\\' As he describes it, turning Range Rover, Defender and Discovery into their own standalone brands rather than Land Rover models gives each its own values and direction. A Defender is free to be very different than a Range Rover up and down the product line.\\nUnder the new system, each brand (including Jaguar) has its own managing director who reports to Hoornik and each brand gets its own special attention up to and including separate meetings with the boss to chart its course. \\'Instead of a Jaguar meeting and a Land Rover meeting,\\' he said, \\'Each week I have a Jaguar meeting and a Defender meeting and a Range Rover meeting and a Discovery meeting.\\' It goes all the way down the chain to regions and individual markets where each brand now has its own managers rather than a single local boss juggling multiple brands.\\nMore:The new 2025 Lincoln Navigator is here and it\\'s spectacular\\nHoornik and Ingham are convinced the brands will have little trouble standing on their own. Range Rover, as Ingham points out, is already a \\'strong, independent range of vehicles.\\' McGovern is right, too: no one calls their Range Rover a \\'Land Rover Range Rover.\\' Defender, Hoornik says, is selling five to six-times as many vehicles globally as it did before the big redesign that took it from body-on-frame anachronism to thoroughly modern off-roader, and at roughly double the price. What\\'s more, most Defender buyers are new to the brand. That kind of relaunch has him convinced a standalone Defender brand will do just fine.\\nHe\\'s less buoyant on Discovery. The least-famous former Land Rover brand has lots of loyal fans, Hoonik says, and does steady business. It\\'s apparently not enough, though, because he also says \\'we are reimagining Discovery completely.\\' Whether it\\'ll get it total and complete reboot like Jaguar is currently experiencing remains to be seen, but he seemed to imply the current Discovery and Discovery Sport aren\\'t cutting it in light of what Defender is doing.\\nAs for Jag, we recently interviewed its brand manager, Rawdon Glover, who told us it\\'s being reimagined from the ground up. The entire current lineup has been cancelled, a completely new styling language has been developed, a high-end sales experience is being planned, and the first of its future all-electric, $100,000-plus luxury lineup will be unveiled in December. \\'If the new Jag could be on the Concept Lawn at Pebble Beach today,\\' Hoonik added, \\'no one could not look at it.\\'\\nAn underlying theme emerged in speaking separately with Hoonik, Ingham, Glover and McGovern: trust us, we know what we\\'re doing. Each eluded to a grand, long-term plan which they\\'re reluctant to fully explain but assure us will all make sense in the end. \\'We\\'re over the hurdle,\\' Hoonik said. \\'We\\'ve got it figured out.\\' The public just needs to be patient and wait for the new product to gradually roll out, it seems. JLR North America vice president of communications, Stuart Schorr, reiterated \\'it\\'s a long-term strategy and you haven\\'t seen so many things that are coming.\\'',\n",

       "   'summary': 'With about a month until Election Day, Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin is leading Republican challenger Eric Hovde in the most recent Marquette University Law School poll. Criticisms of one by the other are at a fever pitch.\\nDuring a Sept. 16 appearance on the Vicki McKenna Show on 1310 WIBA, Hovde dogged Baldwin for a federal earmark she requested for a Madison-area organization that serves at-risk youth.\\nIn doing so, Hovde claimed, Baldwin \\'gave our taxpayer money to a transgender clinic, affirming clinic — which is their buzzword — that does it without even telling parents.\\'\\nHis remark strays from the facts.\\nLet\\'s take a closer look.\\nWhen asked for the evidence behind the claim, a spokesperson for Hovde pointed to the $400,000 in federal dollars that Baldwin requested from a $1.2 trillion government spending package passed in March for Fitchburg-based Briarpatch Youth Services, which serves runaway and homeless youth in Dane County.\\nIts programs include a youth homeless shelter, employment services and help for those navigating the criminal justice system, among others.\\nThe funds were specifically for therapeutic and clinical counseling for youth who are experiencing homelessness, according to the request posted to Baldwin\\'s website.\\nBut the move triggered Republican uproar because Briarpatch also runs a program called Teens Like Us, which provides support to LGBTQ youth ages 13-18. Last year, its website mentioned that youth did not need permission from a guardian to join the program, and that gender-affirming clothing like chest binders and swimwear was also available.\\nNeither point appears on the page today, a move the organization told Wisconsin Watch it made to protect youth safety. Briarpatch executive director Jill Pfeiffer told PolitiFact Wisconsin that in most cases, parents are the ones bringing their children to the Teens Like Us program to give them a safe place to explore their identity.\\nPolitiFact Wisconsin asked Hovde\\'s team to clarify what he meant in saying the organization \\'does it\\' without telling parents. His spokesperson declined to specifically answer the question, noting that news outlets reported the gender-affirming clothing offering and the fact that youth can join the program without permission.\\nBut in the multiple times Hovde has offered variations of this claim, he doesn\\'t reference clothing. Instead, he\\'s made vague claims that the organization works with children on \\'transgendering them,\\' helps kids \\'go through the transgender process,\\' or, in the case of the specific statement we are examining here, \\'does it.\\'\\nAfter his statement, McKenna claimed the organization would \\'alter children, mutilate them surgically or put them on drugs that can have a permanent impact on their quality of life\\' — things Hovde didn\\'t dispute.\\nTaken together, it all connotes an element of gender-affirming medical care that Briarpatch does not provide. Not only does his phrase \\'transgender clinic\\' misconstrue the overall mission of the organization, Wisconsin minors are prohibited by law from getting medical treatment without the signature of a parent or guardian.\\nSecond, the taxpayer money that Hovde references is not going to the Teens Like Us program, Baldwin\\'s staff told the Journal Sentinel in March and Pfeiffer confirmed to PolitiFact Wisconsin.\\nBecause the request came from the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration, a Baldwin spokesperson told the Journal Sentinel, the funds would be prohibited from being used for the activities described in the Teens Like Us program. Pfeiffer confirmed they are for counseling for youth experiencing homelessness and other hardships.\\nHovde claimed that Baldwin gave taxpayer money to a transgender-affirming clinic that \\'does it without even telling parents.\\'\\nBaldwin did secure funds for Briarpatch Youth Services, which has a program for LGBTQ youth that doesn\\'t require parental permission to join. But Hovde\\'s vagueness leaves room for the idea that there\\'s gender-affirming medical treatment happening, which is not accurate. On top of that, and most significantly, the funds Baldwin requested went to an entirely different program, and are not being used for the purpose Hovde claimed.\\nWe rate this claim False.\\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, \\'Tammy Baldwin opens 7-point lead over Eric Hovde in new Marquette poll,\\' Oct. 2, 2024\\nUSA TODAY, \\'Congress passes $1.2 trillion spending bill after short government shutdown,\\' March 23, 2024\\nBriarpatch Youth Services website, accessed Oct. 1, 2024\\nTammy Baldwin, Congressionally Directed Spending Requests for Fiscal Year 2024, accessed Oct. 1, 2024\\nBriarpatch Youth Services, \"Teens Like Us LGBTQIA2s+,\" (archived 2023), accessed Oct. 1, 2024\\nWisconsin Watch, \\'Did Tammy Baldwin fund a transgender clinic for youths?\\' Sept. 17, 2024\\nAmerican Sunrise, \\'Latest on Wisconsin Senate race,\\' Aug. 12, 2024\\nThe Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show, \\'Eric Hovde on His Race Against Tammy Baldwin and Harris-Walz,\\' accessed Oct. 2, 2024\\nEmail exchange with Jill Pfeiffer, Briarpatch Youth Services, Sept. 30, 2024\\nGreen Bay Press Gazette, \\'Wisconsin youth can\\'t seek health care without parental consent.

Working through the highs and lows of the season,\" he said Wednesday night. Mitchell\\'s two-out, two-run home run in the eighth inning led the Milwaukee Brewers to a dramatic 5-3 victory over the New York Mets in Game 2 of the teams\\' National League wild-card series at American Family Field.\\n\"It felt good. You dream of moments like that. You want to be in those situations. Obviously, there\\'s a lot of pressure there, but at the same time it\\'s just enjoying the game and having fun. It\\'s a kids\\' game. If you play it at a young age, those are the types of things you look at when you\\'re in the backyard.\\n\"It was awesome, exciting. Still trying to come down from it. But most importantly, excited to play another day of baseball.\"\\nMore:Brewers have a $10 ticket deal for decisive Game 3 playoff matchup against the Mets\\nMitchell, the Brewers\\' first-round pick in 2020, has battled myriad injuries in his time with the organization – most recently a fractured finger on his left hand he suffered on a fluke swing during a batting-practice session in spring training.\\nIt wasn\\'t a serious break, but it took serious time to heal. Three months, in fact, with Mitchell finally rejoining the team on July 1. He played 69 games the rest of the way, hitting .255 with eight homers, 21 runs batted in and an .811 OPS to go along with 11 stolen bases.\\nOne of several talented young outfielders on the Brewers\\' 26-man roster, Mitchell possesses a rare mix of size, speed and power that has made a believer of his teammates despite the fact he\\'s played only 118 games since debuting in 2022.\\nAnd now, he\\'s the owner of one of Milwaukee\\'s bigger postseason moments.\\nEntering Wednesday, the Brewers had lost 20 straight playoff games when trailing after seven innings. And it was just the second go-ahead postseason homer in the eighth inning or later in franchise history. Mitchell joined Paul Molitor, who homered in the eighth inning of Game 3 of the 1981 American League Division Series at New York to give the Brewers a 4-3 lead.\\n\"Insane. Insane,\" is how Willy Adames described Mitchell\\'s talents. \"I know for him that felt amazing. For the team, it felt unbelievable. That changed the whole game right there. He gave us an opportunity to play Game 3 tomorrow.\"\\nIt was Adames who was on base when Mitchell stepped to the plate in the eighth, an inning that began with the Brewers trailing, 3-2, but quickly flipped when Jackson Chourio led off against Phil Maton with a homer to right.\\nThree batters and two outs later, Adames had battled back from an 0-2 count to single to left and give Mitchell a chance. He was 0 for 3 in his postseason debut in Milwaukee\\'s 8-4 Game 1 loss and had been thrown out trying to steal second base after entering as a pinch-runner in the sixth.\\nMitchell wasted no time in ambushing Maton, drilling a first-pitch curveball to right-center at 107.3 mph that carried 390 feet and just barely made it over the wall.\\n\"My thought was just look for something out over,\" Mitchell said. \"A couple of the thoughts going through my mind were, \\'Be aggressive early.\\' Knowing the situation, he was looking to get a strike there. Then as for the curveball part, just my body getting to the right position. Being on time and giving myself a shot to hit that pitch.\\n\"That\\'s not the first time I\\'ve hit a curveball out this year on the first pitch. But I was in the right position to hit the pitch, and my thought process was to try to put the ball in play, pass it to the next guy and see what happens.\\n\"But obviously, I\\'ll take the homer.\"\\nMitchell\\'s celebration was emphatic as he rounded first, as he gestured to the stands with the crowd of 40,350 going wild.\\n\"When I hit it, I felt like I hit it hard enough,\" Mitchell said. \"I felt like I got it, and at that point I was kind of just looking and waiting and seeing what was happening. And when I saw it go out, I was fired up, obviously.\\n\"Once I knew it was gone, after that it was blackout. Fired-up with the teammates, pumped with the fans. Just, all of that.\"\\nIt was the knockout blow the Brewers needed, as Devin Williams pitched a 1-2-3 ninth to snap Milwaukee\\'s six-game postseason losing streak.\\nIt was also the type of payoff that everyone who knows Mitchell was happy to see the 26-year-old receive after missing almost all of 2023 following shoulder surgery and almost two months in the minor leagues in 2022 due to an oblique strain.\\n\"Garrett has been through three years of being injured,\" manager Pat Murphy said with emotion in his voice. \"Missed how many games this year? He\\'s willing to do anything. We\\'ve got one of the best defensive centerfielders in baseball (Blake Perkins), so he\\'s played a lot of right field. He hasn\\'t gotten to play every game.\\n\"You\\'d never know he\\'s been through that adversity because he just doesn\\'t show it to you. He just comes ready to play. He\\'s got a smile on his face. He\\'s ready to play every day.\\n\"The attitude gets him through it.\"\\nMitchell, who\\'d endured myriad postgame interviews with national media before entertaining local reporters in a quieted-down home clubhouse, simply smiled when it was pointed out to him how much he\\'d persevered before coming through in a career-defining moment.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'AUBURN HILLS, Michigan - At a stop in suburban Detroit, Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance blasted Vice President Kamala Harris on Wednesday for what he said was failed leadership.\\n\"If you\\'ve got all these great ideas, I\\'ve got a message: Why don\\'t you try it right now?\" the Ohio GOP senator and Donald Trump running mate told a crowd of about 200 people at Visioneering, an aerospace manufacturing company in Michigan\\'s Oakland County. \"Because you\\'re the sitting vice president and you haven\\'t done a damn thing for America.\"\\nThe crowd of Republican partisans in the critical 2024 battleground state cheered Vance, who is running to be vice president with former President Donald Trump.\\nVance flew to metro Detroit just hours after completing his one and only debate with Harris\\' running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota. He passed on criticizing Walz, saying he felt sorry for him having to defend Harris\\' economic record.\\nWatch replay:Vice presidential debate between Vance, Walz\\nVance won general praise for most of his debate performance, though he took widespread criticism for failing to answer a question about whether Trump won the 2020 election. Asked about his non-answer, Vance dodged again.\\n\"Here\\'s the simple reason, the media wants to talk about the election four years ago, I\\'m focused on the election 33 days from now,\" he said.\\nHe went on to blast Democratic opposition to the SAVE Act, a bill that would require documentary proof of citizenship to register to vote. Democrats have said it\\'s already illegal for noncitizens to vote and the legislation would make it hard to register voters.\\nStanding in front of a crowd with a giant American flag as a backdrop, Vance took a sharper tone onstage than he did during the televised debate. He hammered away at Harris, mentioning her name more than four dozen times in a speech that lasted almost an hour.\\nHe promised to place the interests of American workers at the heart of Trump\\'s second term. Vance stood by his criticism of electric vehicle mandates, saying they tilt the playing field in China\\'s favor.\\n\"There\\'s an entire supply chain in the auto industry, and China dominates when it comes to EVs, and America dominates when it comes to gas powered cars,\" Vance said.\\nHarris campaign surrogate Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., said in a statement that Trump is the one who failed autoworkers.\\n\\'He said he\\'d create more opportunities for workers and ignite a manufacturing boom across the Midwest, but when he got to the White House, he caused a manufacturing recession instead,\\' Dingell said. \"Vice President Harris is looking to the future while Donald Trump and JD Vance want to drag our country backwards.\"\\nA Free Press analysis shows that the overall picture on auto jobs is complicated.\\nRick Kuchta, 61, of Chesterfield, is an HVAC contractor who has attended other rallies. He wanted to see Vance, saying he\\'d watched the debate the night before and thought Vance won it.\\n\"I like him. I think he\\'s very down to earth, very relatable,\" Kuchta said. \"I just like his demeanor and his policy. He\\'s right behind Trump.\"\\nKuchta said he\\'s voting for Trump and hopes he wins, but he expects controversy either way.\\n\"I think no matter what happens, it will be a mess,\" he said. \"Nobody wants to lose and everybody thinks they\\'re gonna win. Somebody\\'s gonna lose.\"\\nKimberly Knue, 54, of Milford, is an employee benefits manager who attended the event to see Vance.\\n\"I think he\\'s a national treasure,\" she said. \"I think he\\'s smart, he\\'s articulate, he\\'s innovative. He brings a lot of ideas to the table. He\\'s a good leader. I love his background. I love his family.\"\\nShe said she expects Trump to win, but said it would be \"very close.\"',\n",

Adams wanted to play with then-Raiders quarterback and his former teammate at Fresno State, Derek Carr.\\nHe got that chance, but the reunion didn\\'t last long after Carr was benched late in the 2022 season. Carr was then cut after the season. Adams still produced at a high level in 2023, despite the team\\'s quarterback situation not what he envisioned when he left Green Bay.\\nThere were rumblings during this past offseason about Adams\\' future in Las Vegas even as he was about to enter the third year in his five-year contract. For their parts, the team and player said all the right things heading into the 2024 season.\\nThat brought us to the last week.\\nAdams, nursing a hamstring injury, didn\\'t play in the team\\'s 20-16 win over the Cleveland Browns last Sunday.\\nAnd then on Monday Raiders coach Antonio Pierce apparently liked a social media post from Sports Illustrated\\'s Michael Fabiano that speculated Adams may have \"already played his last snap with the Raiders.\"\\nNFL Network Insiders Ian Rapoport and Mike Garafolo then reported on Tuesday that Adams has preferred to be traded.\\nAs a guest on Kay Adams\\' Up & Adams show on FanDuel TV Tuesday, Adams sounded like a player who is keeping all of his options open.\\n\"I haven\\'t heard from him, I haven\\'t talked to him,\" Adams said about Pierce liking the social media post. \"I don\\'t really know what it\\'s exactly about. Social media is a beast. There\\'s a lot of people that saw it and wondering what\\'s going on and people reaching out. I haven\\'t spoken to him.\\n\"It\\'s hard to comment on.

       "   'summary': 'Hundreds of people are still missing following Hurricane Helene\\'s ravaging of the Southeast, including a North Carolina woman who was swept away along with her husband, their vacation home and the couple\\'s three dogs.\\nKim Ashby, 58, disappeared on Friday along with her husband, Rod Ashby, her daughter, Jessica Meidinger, told USA TODAY on Wednesday. The married couple of five years drove from Sanford, North Carolina to their vacation home in Elk Park to retrieve some precious family items from the property\\'s garage, Meidinger said.\\nThe final time Meidinger recalled speaking to her mother and stepfather was Thursday night.\\nMeidinger and her family did not know the Ashbys had gone missing until one of the couple\\'s neighbors in Elk Park informed them by using a Starlink satellite to send a Facebook message. Meidinger said she learned that her mother and stepfather were inside their vacation home when flooding caused the property to slide into a nearby river.\\nThe couple\\'s vacation home being affected by flooding is an indicator of how dastardly Hurricane Helene was: Rod Ashby had designed the property to prevent flood water from entering it.\\n\"The way he structured the house was the garage is on the bottom and he put doors on both sides so he could lift (them) and allow water to flow through underneath,\" Meidinger said.\\nEverything was working fine until Rod Ashby heard a crack on Friday morning, which prompted him to go outside and check it out. He noticed the corner pillar of the home had been taken out, according to Meidinger. Before the couple and their three dogs could reach high ground, the house had slid into the water, she added.\\nTo remain afloat, the married couple got on top of a mattress in the back room of the home and rode down the river at a speed of about 30 to 40 miles per hour, Meidinger said. At some point, the home hit an embankment and collapsed on top of the couple.\\nRod Ashby managed to get himself out of the debris, but Kim Ashby was 10 or 20 feet away from him, according to Meidinger. The couple was separated, but not for long, as a wall from the home landed on its side allowing them to grab ahold of it. The two managed to stay on the wall until they hit a spot of trees, which caused them both to fly into the water.\\n\"That was kind of the last that we saw of my mom,\" Meidinger said.\\nOnce underwater, Rod Ashby fought for air long enough until he managed to grab a tree branch that was leaning over the river, according to his stepdaughter. He then pulled himself out of the water, but when he looked for his wife, she was nowhere to be seen.\\nA shoeless Rod Ashby went to go find help because he figured his wife had gone downstream, Meidinger said. He then ran about 10 miles until he reached his neighbor\\'s home and eventually contacted Meidinger and other family members.\\n\"Physically, he\\'s got some non-life-threatening injuries,\" Meidinger said about her 58-year-old stepfather. \"Mentally, I mean... you have your wife in your arms one minute and the next she\\'s gone. You can\\'t describe what that must do to a human being. He\\'s really broken up and just anxious to get back out there to keep searching.\"\\nRod Ashby is currently in Pittsboro, North Carolina with Meidinger and her family as he holds out hope that his wife will come home safe. Meidinger said authorities have sent out dogs and have thermal imaging drones currently searching for her mother.\\nThe support Meidinger and her family have received has been immense, specifically from the middle school Kim Ashby taught math at and the town of Elk Park.\\n\"They\\'ve been reaching out regularly and said that they\\'re very much a family at that school and (Kim Ashby) is kind of like the heart of the seventh grade,\" Meidinger said about SanLee Middle School. \"They\\'ve been doing prayer circles.\"\\nResidents in Avery County, where Elk Park is located, have also reached out and offered help to Meidinger and her family.\\n\"It\\'s just been surreal, I mean just the level of giving that we\\'ve received,\" Meidinger said about Elk Park.\\nIf Kim Ashby is somewhere safe, Meidinger said the biggest thing she wants her mother to know is her husband is \"safe and OK.\"',\n",

Williams gets his first postseason save opportunity in the ninth.\\nMitchell was batting for the first time; he checked in as a pinch runner in the sixth and was thrown out stealing.\\nAFTER EIGHTH: Brewers 5, Mets 3\\nYOU CAN\\'T TEACH CLUTCH #Undaunted x @GarretMitchell5 https://t.co/0f6XHcACrg pic.twitter.com/AaTAnFOtLb\\nFor the second time tonight, Jackson Chourio has tied the game with a home run.\\nHis shot to right center off Phil Maton leading off the eighth and sent this place up for grabs. The Brewers and Mets are locked up at 3-3 in the eighth inning.\\nAccording to MLB.com stats guru Sarah Langs, he\\'s the second youngest player to have a multi-homer game in the playoffs. At 20 years & 205 days, only Andruw Jones (19y, 180d) was younger when he homered twice in Game 1 of the 1996 World Series.\\nWE ARE ALL WITNESSES @Bryanchourio11 https://t.co/sneLUJPKSx pic.twitter.com/e4jYo5mkol\\nFor the fourth time tonight, the Mets got a leadoff man on base; Starling Marte drew a walk after Joe Ross had gotten ahead, 0-2, but Tyrone Taylor flew out and Francisco Alvarez grounded into a double play on the first pitch he saw. Ross delivers four big outs, and now the game is in the hands of the offense and closer Devin Williams (at least, until extra innings if we need them).\\nIt\\'s a 1-2-3 frame for Milwaukee in the seventh, with the bottom third of the order all putting it in play but nothing too dangerous.\\nMilwaukee has six outs left to save its season. Joe Ross back to the mound for the eighth.\\nEND SEVENTH: Mets 3, Brewers 2\\nBrewers just chewed through the tough part of New York\\'s order for a clean seventh. Jared Koenig registered groundouts from Mark Vientos and Brandon Nimmo, and after a broken-bat single by Pete Alonso, manager Pat Murphy went to right-hander Joe Ross for J.D. Martinez.\\nMartinez hit it decently well, but Joey Ortiz had enough hops to go get it. Ortiz also made a slick fielding play earlier in the inning to retire Nimmo.\\nBrewers go to the bottom half needing at least a run.\\nGarrett Mitchell checked in for Gary Sánchez after an infield single and got thrown out stealing, and then Rhys Hoskins struck out to kill another inning.\\nThe Brewers veterans are nowhere to be found. Willy Adames, who grounded out leading off the inning, is now 0 for 6 in this series. Hoskins is also 0 for 6, though he was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded yesterday.\\nReed Garrett threw that frame for the Mets; Manaea ends up with five innings of work, allowing two runs on six hits.\\nJared Koenig checks in. The Brewers have three innings to save their season.\\nEND SIXTH: Mets 3, Brewers 2\\nJoel Payamps made the huge mistake Tuesday that led to a five-run inning, but he was absolute nails down the stretch for Milwaukee, and I thought it was fine that Payamps was back on the mound here in Game 2.\\nIt didn\\'t go smoothly, but it ended well for Milwaukee. Payamps lost a battle with J.D. Martinez and walked him leading off the sixth, and then Starling Marte was right on a few pitches before bounding a single through the right side. That brought up Tyrone Taylor, who hit a dangerous blooper that Sal Frelick caught in right field.\\nPayamps then escaped by getting Francisco Alvarez to hit a check-swing tapper in front of the mound, walking Francisco Lindor and getting Jose Iglesias swinging.\\nThere are, by the way, 40,350 fans in this stadium for tonight\\'s game. Neither one of these two games were sellouts.\\nThe Brewers get a breakthrough in the fifth, with Brice Turang leading off with a double and coming around to score on a groundout and Blake Perkins sacrifice fly to center.\\nThat makes it 3-2. Turang, who had three hits yesterday (two doubles), has two hits today, including another double. Remarkable series for Turang.\\nEND FIFTH: Mets 3, Brewers 2\\nMegill\\'s three-strikeout fifth inning is going to leave some people wondering if a bullpen game was the way to go. He just blew away Pete Alonso to close out the fifth, in which Brandon Nimmo reached on a hit-by-pitch and advanced to second on a balk. But Jose Iglesias, Mark Vientos and Alonso all punched out.\\nJoey Ortiz hit a sharp grounder to shortstop on a full-count pitch, ending Milwaukee\\'s fourth inning. Sal Frelick\\'s two-out single went for naught and the Brewers remain down a pair.\\nEND FOURTH: Mets 3, Brewers 1\\nTrevor Megill retires Francisco Lindor on a pop up to left, and the Brewers survive without any further damage. It was a tightrope walk with Montas in there, and he finished with 52 pitches and, technically, only one earned run, but he\\'s the reason the other two are unearned after he dropped the feed at first base.\\nHe also allowed six hits and a walk in 3⅔ innings. It will not be remembered as a successful outing.\\nThe Mets are still batting in the fourth with a runner at second and Francisco Lindor due up, but it\\'ll be Trevor Megill heading into the game to try and end the inning.\\nStarling Marte is standing at second after a leadoff single and steal of second. He was initially ruled out, but replay overturned the call to put him in scoring position with no outs. Montas rallied, striking out Tyrone Taylor and Francisco Alvarez, but he won\\'t get a chance to face the Mets a third time through the order.\\nManager Pat Murphy let him go a little bit deeper than Freddy Peralta last night in terms of batters faced; we\\'ll see if that last runner comes across. Brewers can\\'t afford for this two-run deficit to inflate.\\nWilliam Contreras struck out and Willy Adames popped out on a lazy fly to center, eliminating a scoring opportunity for the Brewers in the third.\\nBrice Turang singled leading off the inning, and Turang\\'s speed won Blake Perkins a single when he slid in safely ahead of a glove toss from sliding Francisco Lindor to second base. But Jackson Chourio struck out in between, and the team\\'s three premier hitters all made outs in that frame.\\nEND THIRD: Mets 3, Brewers 1\\nBrandon Nimmo put a ball on the warning track in dead center field, and J.D. Martinez made good contact on a screamer to left field, but both balls were caught and Milwaukee will look to dent the 3-1 deficit in the bottom of the third.\\nSal Frelick might have beaten out an infield grounder but the Brewers don\\'t review, and it\\'s a nice play by shortstop Francisco Lindor to spin and retire him. The play was sandwiched by two flyouts, and we head to the third inning.\\nEND SECOND: Mets 3, Brewers 1\\nThe Brewers have seen multi-run leads evaporate in each of the past four playoff games, so now it\\'s their turn to do some digging. Last night after the disastrous five-run fifth, Brewers batters went into hibernation, and the final 17 batters in a row were retired.\\nObviously, there\\'s a lot of ballgame left but they can\\'t afford a similar malaise.\\nThat didn\\'t take long to sting.\\nAfter Montas dropped the ball, that runner came around to score quickly. The bloop single from ex-Brewers outfielder Tyrone Taylor put runners at the corners, and Francisco Alvarez then singled in the run. Another run scored as a result of the error when Francisco Lindor sent a deep drive to center for a sacrifice fly to score Taylor. It would have been the third out otherwise.\\nMets have a 3-1 lead. The defense that got the Brewers here has failed them in the postseason, though in very strange ways.\\nLast night, the Mets staged a two-out rally worth five runs when Joel Payamps was late covering first base. This time, Frankie Montas was there ... and dropped the ball.\\nMilwaukee is again in trouble because a pitcher can\\'t properly complete a 3-1 putout. Montas just straight dropped the feed from Rhys Hoskins for an error, and after a bloop single, the Mets again have runners at the corners with one out for the second straight inning.\\nMilwaukee might be cursed, guys.\\nSean Manaea allowed the homer to Chourio but threw 14 of his 18 pitches for strikes in the opening frame, allowing a single to William Contreras but also getting two strikeouts to close it down.\\nAFTER FIRST: Mets 1, Brewers 1\\nJackson Chourio is so special. Unbelievable.\\nThe 20-year-old just went opposite field on an 0-2 pitch for a home run to tie the game before the Brewers even surrender an out. The American Family Field crowd waved yellow rally towels in appreciation as he rounded the bases. It\\'s the first home run of the series for either team.\\nIt\\'s the second leadoff home run for the Brewers in their postseason history. Corey Hart turned the feat in Game 6 of the NLCS against St. Louis in 2011. The Brewers were losing that game, too, having yielded four first-inning runs.\\nTHE ROOKIE ANSWERS#Undaunted x @bryanchourio11 https://t.co/01pwfiwqHs pic.twitter.com/5UWgwmBsCo\\nWilly Adames made a diving stop on Pete Alonso\\'s ball up the middle, bobbled, but still had time to start a double play because Alonso stumbled out of the box. That saves the Brewers from surrendering another run, and maybe it\\'s the jolt they need after going down right off the bat.\\nAlonso stumbled on his own bat as he dropped it to the ground. Strange play! Adames struggled getting that relay going after he fell to the ground to stop it, pretty sure Alonso reaches base safely without the fall.\\nThe Brewers have had a habit of surrendering multi-run leads in the playoffs. Today, they\\'ll be playing from behind.\\nAfter the leadoff walk to Lindor and a fielder\\'s choice, Mark Vientos reached on an infield single and Brandon Nimmo poked one through the right side to drive in a run, and it\\'s 1-0. And it\\'s runners at the corners with one out. Just not the start Milwaukee needed.\\nFormer position-player prospect Lucas Erceg, who converted to pitcher with the Brewers and was then dealt to Oakland to make his big-league debut, just closed out a 2-1 win for the Royals and sent Kansas City past Baltimore in the wild-card round.\\nDevastating end of the road for the Orioles, who lost their games by a 2-1 and 1-0 count. Erceg, who has thrown in the triple digits this year, was dealt to Kansas City at the deadline and has been spectacular.\\nThat\\'s now all 10 series in the wild-card round since the new format was adopted in 2022 that have ended with the Game 1 winner victorious. Only one of those went to three games. Ominous.\\nGranted, last night began with a 1-2-3 first and two runs in the bottom half, then went downhill, so I don\\'t know if the initial batter can really offer an omen of any kind, but Frankie Montas walks Francisco Lindor on a full-count pitch leading off the first, and we\\'re under way.\\nMike Moustakas, who delivered the game-winning single in extras to beat the Colorado Rockies in Game 1 of the National League Division Series in 2018, is in the house for the ceremonial first pitch. The crowd regales him with \"Moooooose,\" of course.\\nWe are just about set for baseball.\\nJust checking on to ESPN looking for the Brewers game? It\\'s going to air on ESPN2 until the Orioles-Royals game finishes up.\\nGood nugget from the Brewers game notes: Tonight\\'s pitchers were teammates for four years in Oakland from 2017-21. Frankie Montas started with the Chicago White Sox in 2015 but joined Oakland two years later. He was actually traded three times before he pitched with Oakland, and one deal included the Mets\\' starting second baseman, Jose Iglesias, who went from Boston to Detroit in that three-team maneuver.\\nOakland traded him to the Yankees in 2002.\\nSean Manaea was drafted in 2013 by the Royals but was dealt to Oakland, and he made his debut there in 2016. He signed as a free agent with the Giants in 2022 and Mets in 2024.\\nJosh Hader has been one of the greatest closers in baseball over the past six years, but man, he\\'s had some rough luck in the postseason.\\nHader allowed three hits and two walks in 1⅓ innings for Houston on Wednesday, and Andy Ibáñez\\'s bases-clearing double was the difference in a 5-2 win for the Tigers that ended Houston\\'s season. The American League No. 3 seed is out.\\nHader was on the hill in 2019 when the Brewers lost a 3-1 lead to the Nationals, though that was a series of unfortunate events that included a bloop single, a hit-by-pitch that probably should have been called a foul and an error by right fielder Trent Grisham. Hader also served up a home run to Freddie Freeman with two outs in the bottom of the eighth in Game 4 of the 2021 NLDS, giving Atlanta a 5-4 win and sealing the series victory for the Braves.\\nWe should point out the good, though, as well. Hader appeared in all three games of the series with Colorado in 2018 and didn\\'t allow a baserunner, striking out four of the seven men he faced. He struck out 12 batters over 7⅔ innings in the 2018 NLCS vs. the Dodgers. He was also excellent for the Padres in 2022.\\nIn fact, coming into today, Hader\\'s postseason ERA was 1.31, with three earned runs in 20⅔ innings and a ridiculous 33 strikeouts to four walks.\\nWith the Tigers win over Houston, that\\'s now nine wild-card series in the new format adopted in 2022, and all nine have been won by the team that wins Game 1.\\nThat\\'s a little misleading, of course. There were eight three-game series in 2020, a makeshift format for the season abbreviated to 60 games by COVID-19. Even then, six of those series ended in two games, but the two that didn\\'t featured comebacks from one win down by both the Padres and Athletics.\\nWhat\\'s amazing about this run since 2022, though, is that one series has even gone to three games, and the team that won Game 1 prevailed. It could be 10 series by the time this game starts, too, with Kansas City looking for the sweep against Baltimore and up 1-0 midway though.\\nSo can the Brewers make a bit of history? It starts with a win Wednesday night.\\nIt\\'s closed for Game 2\\nTime: 6:38 p.m.\\nDate: Wednesday, Oct. 2\\nHow to watch: Brewers vs Mets in Game 2 of wild-card playoff series\\nThe Brewers released their playoff roster for the wild-card series against the Mets, and Sal Frelick — whose hip injury in the final series of the year put his roster status in question — is on the list.\\nIsaac Collins is also on the roster, as are all three catchers who have been with the team during the latter portion of the season. Notable players missing are reliever Bryan Hudson, who hasn\\'t been with the team for most of the September while working in Class AAA Nashville, and Colin Rea, a starter all season who worked more than 100 pitches in the season finale.\\nThe Brewers do have four pitchers who have been starting on the team, including Freddy Peralta, Frankie Montas, Tobias Myers and Aaron Civale. Here\\'s the full list:\\nRANKING BREWERS ROSTER: From 1 to 26, who is most crucial to October success\\nThis time of year, #Undaunted is our game pic.twitter.com/Qo94Sdnv3J\\nThe Brewers cruised to the NL Central championship for a second straight season with a 93-69 record.

       "   'summary': 'Almost 25,000 dockworkers at various ports along the East and Gulf Coasts are striking to ask for higher pay and protections from having their jobs automated out of existence.\\nMarking the first such strike in almost 50 years, members of the International Longshoremen\\'s Association walked off the job on Tuesday. In a social media post, the union\\'s president Harold Daggett said the union was fighting for \\'the kind of wages we deserve.\\'\\nIn a statement on Monday, the union blamed the United States Maritime Alliance, which represents docks and ocean carriers, for continuing to block an agreement that would end the strike.\\n\\'The Ocean Carriers represented by USMX want to enjoy rich billion-dollar profits that they are making in 2024, while they offer ILA Longshore Workers an unacceptable wage package that we reject,\" the statement said.\\nWhile 14 ports in the East and Gulf Coast are seeing striking workers, West Coast ports have not been affected as a different union represents its workers. Back in 2023, the West Coast union negotiated wage increases for its workers.\\nThe wages negotiated by the West Coast dockworkers union is one of the reasons for the current strike. ILA workers make significantly less than their counterparts.\\nThe ILA contract that expired on Monday shows that the starting pay for dockworkers was $20 per hour. Pay rises to $24.75 after two years, $31.90 after three and tops out at $39 for workers with at least six years on the job.\\nMeanwhile, the ILA is demanding a 77% increase over the duration of the contract, with a $5 increase each year of the contract. Workers would make $44 the first year, $49 the second and up to $69 in the final year.\\nIn recent days, the U.S. Maritime Alliance proposed a smaller increase, nearly 50%, which the ILA rejected.\\n\"They might claim a significant increase, but they conveniently omit that many of our members are operating multi-million-dollar container-handling equipment for a mere $20 an hour. In some states, the minimum wage is already $15,\" the ILA said.\\nThe current top wage amounts to about $81,000 per year, but according to a Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor report about a third of local longshoremen made $200,000 or more a year.\\nHowever, that pay may come with extreme hours. The ILA president, Harold Daggett, told the Associated Press that many of the workers earning high wages work up to 100 hours a week.\\n\\'Our members don\\'t work typical 9-to-5 jobs; they work extraordinary hours, sacrificing time with their families. Our position is firm: we believe in the value our incredible rank-and-file members bring to this industry and to our great nation,\\' the ILA said in a statement.\\nThe average U.S. salary was about $59,000 in the fourth quarter of 2023, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor.',\n",

       "   'excerpt': 'Broadcaster Diamond Sports announced it intends to drop most of its MLB lineup, at least for now. How does that impact the Brewers?',\n",
       "   'summary': 'Diamond Sports Group, which broadcasts Milwaukee Brewers games under the Bally Sports Wisconsin banner, indicated Wednesday its intention to stop carrying games for the vast majority of Major League Baseball teams under its purview, including the Brewers.\\nEvan Drellich of The Athletic first reported and then clarified the specifics of Diamond\\'s maneuver, indicating that the teams would need to re-negotiate contracts to remain with Diamond, excluding the Atlanta Braves.\\nThe development is part of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy court proceedings. The Brewers\\' contract with Diamond was set to expire after the 2024 season anyway, but the organization indicated it wants to drop broadcasting all of its teams under its umbrella except the Braves. At least, for now.\\nBrewers owner Mark Attanasio laid out the three options that the Brewers have to air games in 2025. Here\\'s what fans should know about the latest developments.\\n\"Trying to take a step back from a macro standpoint, we need to be able to get our games out to a much larger percentage of the addressable market right now,\" he said. \"Only 20% of our television territory can watch our games, so that\\'s not great. And (20-35%) is probably about average for all major-league teams. So, if we do something with MLB Media, it\\'s going to be likely you handle things as a group for some of it, and then you try to piece other things together.\"\\nThat\\'s to be determined.\\nAttanasio indicated three possible avenues, though really two.\\nOne would be to re-negotiate with Diamond Sports and continue down a pathway that resembles status quo, at least for another one-year contract.\\nOne would be to turn over broadcasts to Major League Baseball. The league has repeatedly indicated this as a preferred course of action, and the league already operates broadcasts for the San Diego Padres, Colorado Rockies and Arizona Diamondbacks. The advantage for the league would be to offer the broadcasts on its own MLB.TV app to in-market fans, with no blackouts. The disadvantage is likely lesser broadcast fees paid to the clubs.\\nThe third option would be to \"DIY\" a network arrangement, but that\\'s almost certainly too difficult to pursue. Teams in Houston attempted to build a network for Astros and Rockets coverage nearly a decade ago, and the network quickly went bankrupt in 2014. There simply wasn\\'t enough demand to persuade carriers to offer the channel for a wide audience.\\nHowever, the Rockets and Astros are giving it another go, re-acquiring the channel in 2023, labeling it the Space City Home Network.\\nESPN\\'s Alden Gonzalez cited a source that Diamond remains hopeful of agreeing to new terms with the 11 other teams and has previously submitted proposals to each squad. It remains to be seen if that\\'s a lucrative enough deal for teams to eschew what seems to be MLB\\'s preferred overriding strategy of reclaiming digital rights to as many teams as possible.\\nThe broadcasts wouldn\\'t look or sound all that different. The announcers would largely be the same (most are team employees, anyway), and it\\'s likely MLB will negotiate with carriers to get the games on satellite and cable airwaves. The channel might change, and the games might be available in other places (the Padres games are on Fubo, for example, but also cable and satellite), but Brewers fans won\\'t be short of ways to watch.\\nPadres games, for example, can be found on the MLB.TV app for those in San Diego. Fans can pay $99 for the year to just get Padres games (called the Padres.TV option), but fans who purchase the full package for $200 will also be able to view Padres games in-market. So, fans will still have to pay something if they don\\'t already have a cable or satellite package, but the broadcasts will be available using MLB\\'s native technology and come attached with the opportunity to purchase out-of-market games.\\nYes, it\\'s possible, but the degree to which this becomes a problem hinges on the solutions to distribute games. Milwaukee won\\'t be alone across MLB in facing this challenge, though logically it stands to reason that MLB\\'s broadcasting model will yield smaller rights fees than what Diamond was paying.\\nBaseball already has a revenue-sharing policy and does distribute money to clubs through lucrative national contracts that offers packages of games to places like ESPN or Apple TV+. Those deals reportedly helped MLB secure record gross revenues in 2022.\\nThe impact would theoretically be less evident in the NBA, where a higher proportion of games air nationally and team payrolls are limited by a salary cap, but the bankruptcy could diminish the league\\'s cap number across the board.\\nThe Brewers, for what it\\'s worth, have already decreased payroll in both the 2023 and 2024 seasons from the year before and, oddly enough, won more games each season compared to the year before.\\nAmazon has negotiated with Diamond to air games, but it wouldn\\'t look dramatically different from the current model. Fans would still need to pay for broadcasts and receive special access within the Amazon app.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'Plenty of products may become hard to find amid the ongoing union dockworkers strike, but there is one crucial place that experts don\\'t anticipate consumers are likely to suffer: at the gas pump.\\nOn Tuesday, 45,000 union workers walked off the job when negotiations for a new contract broke down, effectively shutting down 36 East and Gulf coast ports that, combined, handle about half of all U.S. ocean imports. The decision represented the International Longshoremen\\'s Association (ILA) first strike since 1977.\\nThe work stoppage is expected to make it harder for shoppers to find products like bananas, electronics, auto parts, pharmaceuticals and even alcohol. But fortunately for Americans, the strike isn\\'t expected to disrupt the oil and gas industry – at least not right away.\\nHere\\'s what the federal government and other experts want consumers to know about their ability to gas up their vehicles amid the strike.\\nHow port strike could affect shoppers:Alcohol, bananas and seafood among products that could be in short supply\\nBecause crude oil, gasoline, natural gas, and other liquid fuel exports and imports are handled by \"other workers,\" the Department of Energy put out a statement saying that the strike \"will not have any immediate impact on fuel supplies or prices.\"\\nThe department added that it is working with the White House and other government agencies to \"continue partnering with oil and gas companies, as well as electricity generators and utilities, to monitor operations and supply chains.\"\\n\"We encourage all parties to come to the bargaining table and negotiate in good faith – fairly and quickly,\" the agency said.\\nExperts who spoke to USA TODAY on Wednesday tended to agree under one caveat: that the strike doesn\\'t become prolonged.\\nErnie Miller, CEO of Verde Clean Fuels, said fears of a massive spike in oil prices from either the strike or a wider war in the Middle East following Iran\\'s missile strike on Israel may be exaggerated. The United States has something of a \"buffer\" thanks to an increase in domestic oil production in the last decade, he said.\\n\"We\\'re in a very different production scenario now versus years ago when we were a net importer,\" Miller said.\\nWhile that domestic stockpile may protect from a shortage in the short term, a prolonged strike \"could have consequences,\" said Stephen Schwartz, Wells Fargo managing director of supply chain, trade and channel solutions.\\n\"Oil and gas imports and exports are typically handled by different workers and go through terminals outside the scope of the current port strike, Schwartz said. \"However, a protracted strike could have consequences for energy demand in certain sectors such as trucking, rail and bunker fuel used for cargo ships.\"\\nBecause about half of all U.S. ocean imports flow through the ports, consumers may end up facing higher prices and shortages again, Chris Tang, distinguished professor at the University of California, Los Angeles who specializes in supply chain management, told USA TODAY.\\nItems that may experience shortages and higher prices include:\\nThe strike, which is projected to cost the economy up to $5 billion a day, may be keenly felt in consumers\\' wallets if prices increase as a result, experts previously told USA TODAY.\\nEven if port workers agree to a deal, \\'labor costs go up,\\' Tang said. \\'So down the road, consumers still pay a higher price. Consumers will have to learn to adjust and adapt, but unfortunately, things will be more expensive.\\'\\nAmericans may also soon struggle to complete their holiday shopping.\\nBecause of the strike\\'s impending supply chain disruption, consumers may have a tough time finding the toys and other gifts for their children they are looking for in the weeks and months ahead.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'As Camy Matthay readied the book requests of more than 200 Wisconsin inmates earlier this year, she got word of a significant complication: No more used books would be allowed to enter any of the adult institutions.\\nThe news directly impaired the mission of Wisconsin Books to Prisoners, the all-volunteer, Madison-based nonprofit Matthay co-founded in 2006. The organization tries to foster a love of reading behind bars, encourage the pursuit of knowledge and self-empowerment, and help break the cycle of recidivism. It relies on donations from the general public.\\nBut \"bad actors\" have led to the Department of Corrections ceasing the flow of used books coming into the state\\'s 36 adult correctional institutions, wrote Sarah Cooper, the administrator of the DOC\\'s Division of Adult Institutions, in a recent email to Matthay and other Wisconsin Books to Prisoners volunteers. According to incident reports released by the DOC, batches of used books this year have tested positive for dangerous illicit substances.\\n\"Unfortunately, those who wish to send drugs into the prisons do so under the guise of legitimateagencies, organizations and even legal entities,\" Cooper wrote, noting that contributors have veiled themselves as the Child Support Agency, the IRS, the State Public Defender\\'s Office, the Department of Justice and individual attorneys.\\nPrison advocates say barring used books from being delivered is a violation of First and Fourteenth Amendment Rights, basic rights that still apply to people who are incarcerated. Now, the Wisconsin Books to Prisoners is pursuing legal recourse against the state DOC.\\nMoira Marquis, founder of Prison Banned Books Week, a national campaign that highlights book censorship and First Amendment Rights in prisons, has been on the frontlines of prison-related book bans across the United States. She sees Wisconsin DOC\\'s latest actions as part of a widespread trend that attacks basic rights, the tenor of which is only increasing.\\n\"We documented that, in between 2015 and 2023, there was an increase from 30% of carceral facilities to 80% of carceral facilities who were limiting the booksellers that could freely communicate with incarcerated people,\" Marquis said. \"The First Amendment Rights are absolutely under attack.\"\\nSince 2019, Wisconsin DOC has attempted to crack down on contraband potentially laced with K2 and other synthetic cannabinoids from entering its facilities by way of personal letters. These substances, which can be severely harmful and even life-threatening, can be soaked into or sprayed on paper, which then gets distributed across facilities. Typically, according to incident reports, inmates will tear up the substance-laden paper and smoke it.\\nOn Nov. 3, 2021, the DOC announced it was initiating a new process of photocopying mail and using the third-party mail management service TextBehind to deliver messages.\\nThen, on Feb. 8, two of the book bundles allegedly shipped from Wisconsin Books to Prisoners tested positive for drugs at the Oshkosh Correctional Institution, according to incident reports obtained by the Journal Sentinel. The reports showed that one of the book bundles in question tested positive for Spice-G and the second bundle tested positive for Spice-F, Spice-J and Spice-N — all strains of synthetic cannabinoids identified by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.\\nNone of the books in either bundle was delivered. Instead, they are being stored in the investigations room for complaint purposes, according to the incident report.\\nMultiple items from a third shipment of books, also allegedly from Wisconsin Books to Prisoners, in March tested positive for illicit substances, according to Beth Hardtke, director of communications for Wisconsin DOC. That incident report hasn\\'t been released, pending redaction.\\n\"DOC has long prohibited used books from the general public and most organizations from entering our facilities to prevent contraband from entering,\" said Hardtke. \"DOC had previously made an exception for Wisconsin Books to Prisoners due to the organization being based in Wisconsin with leadership who were responsive and willing to work with DOC.\"\\nBook requests have ranged from Merriam-Webster\\'s Collegiate Dictionary — the most requested book across U.S. prisons — to Native American and African American history books, Manga books, and Spanish-learning guides.\\n\"You can pretty much assume that the reading interest of people in prison is comparable to the patronage of any public library,\" Matthay told the Journal Sentinel.\\nMatthay said she understands the need for higher scrutiny to ensure the safety of incarcerated people and DOC staff, but she also questions whether limiting book access in prisons will actually curtail drug use. Books, said Matthay, connect an extremely isolated population to the wider world, give them new skills and can potentially reduce recidivism.\\nDuring COVID-19 prison lockdowns, Matthay\\'s organization regularly received letters from inmates that were both \"incredibly touching and worrisome.\" The books these inmates received through the project helped many \"maintain their sanity,\" Matthay said.\\nMarquis agreed, adding that limiting book access hasn\\'t been effective in mitigating drug smuggling. She cited the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections, which has a separate book processing center that inspects every book and piece of reading material carefully. Despite this and using a mail scanning service, the department recently reported that the rate of random positive drug tests among inmates is now 2.7 times higher than it was before it was implemented.\\nHardtke said this isn\\'t about Wisconsin Books to Prisoners so much as it is about the handling process of used books. In 2021, Hardtke said, there were 192 drug-related contraband incident reports, and, of those reports, 23 \"required outside medical help for persons in our care suspected of overdose or intoxication.\" The following year, there were 164 contraband incident reports, 38 of which involved drugs detected on paper.\\nContraband incident reports continued to taper until 2024, according to Hardtke, when drug-related incidents spiked to 214. More than a quarter of these incidents, at 55, involved paper, Hardtke said. In at least 28 of those incidents, outside medical personnel had to be called to transport or treat people for overdoses or intoxication, Hardtke said.\\nHardtke emphasized that each correctional institution maintains a library, where individuals can go for reading materials. The DOC partners with technical colleges, universities and other education programs to bring in textbooks and other reading materials for classes, she said.\\nRacine Correctional Institution contains more than 11,000 books, Hardtke said, while Green Bay Correctional Institution has \"run out of shelf space and (has) to keep some books in storage.\"\\nBut Matthay, who volunteered for nine years at a prison library, questioned what it means to \"maintain\" a library. In her mind, that could mean anything. At the same time, she has heard from inmates that the selection of reading materials available at institutional libraries leaves much to be desired.\\n\"What I\\'d like to know is how (the DOC) has improved its libraries? How many linear square feet of books have they added to their shelves?\" Matthay said. \"There\\'s a part of me that suspects we may have been the largest contributor of books — as in current books and books of interest — to prisoners.\"\\nWisconsin Books to Prisoners still has the option to donate new books so long as they\\'re sent directly from a bookseller with a receipt, Hardtke said. That policy applies to any individual or organization wanting to send books to inmates.\\nThe DOC is also rolling out new tablets for free to incarcerated individuals that allow access to a number of free ebooks, Hardtke said.\\nBut Marquis said the free ebooks will likely come from Project Gutenberg, which are often books published at least 95 years ago and are in the public domain. The books, though classified as educational, run the risk of being irrelevant, Marquis said.\\nAnd then there\\'s the fact that the reading level required to read 19th-century titles doesn\\'t typically match the reading level of most prisoners — or the general population, for that matter.\\nBoth the DOC and Matthay have expressed a desire to find solutions that safely put books into prisoners\\' hands.\\n\"The department is continuing to talk with Wisconsin Books to Prisoners and hopes to find a way for the organization to support persons in our care and their reading — safely,\" Hardtke said over email.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'DUBAI − Iran\\'s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned Hezbollah leader Syyed Hassan Nasrallah to flee Lebanon days before he was killed in an Israeli strike and is now deeply worried about Israeli infiltration of senior government ranks in Tehran, three Iranian sources said.\\nIn the immediate aftermath of the Sept. 17 attack on Hezbollah\\'s booby-trapped pagers, Khamenei sent a message with an envoy to beseech the Hezbollah secretary general to leave for Iran, citing intelligence reports that suggested Israel had operatives within Hezbollah and was planning to kill him, one of the sources, a senior Iranian official, told Reuters.\\nThe messenger, the official said, was a senior Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander, Brig. Gen. Abbas Nilforoushan, who was with Nasrallah in his bunker when it was hit by Israeli bombs and was also killed.\\nMore:Israel plans \\'significant\\' and swift response to Iran missile attack\\nKhamenei, who has remained in a secure location inside Iran since Saturday, personally ordered a barrage of around 200 missiles to be fired at Israel on Tuesday, a senior Iranian official said. The attack was retaliation for the deaths of Nasrallah and Nilforoushan, the Revolutionary Guards said in a statement.\\nThe statement also cited the July killing of Hamas Leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran, and Israel\\'s attacks on Lebanon. Israel has not claimed responsibility for Haniyeh\\'s death.\\nIsrael on Tuesday began what it labelled as a \"limited\" ground incursion against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon.\\nIran\\'s foreign ministry and the office of Israel\\'s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which oversees the country\\'s foreign intelligence agency Mossad, did not reply to requests for comment.\\nNasrallah\\'s assassination followed two weeks of precise Israeli strikes that have destroyed weapons sites, eliminated half of Hezbollah\\'s leadership council and decimated its top military command. Hundreds have been killed in the air strikes.\\nIran\\'s fears for the safety of Khamenei and the loss of trust, within both Hezbollah and Iran\\'s establishment − and between them − emerged in the conversations with 10 sources for this story, who described a situation that could complicate the effective functioning of Iran\\'s \"Axis of Resistance\" alliance of anti-Israel irregular armed groups.\\nFounded with Iran\\'s backing the 1980s, Hezbollah has long been the most formidable member of the alliance.\\nThe disarray is also making it hard for Hezbollah to choose a new leader, fearing the ongoing infiltration will put the successor at risk, four Lebanese sources said.\\n\"Basically, Iran lost the biggest investment it had for the past decades,\" said Magnus Ranstorp, a Hezbollah expert at the Swedish Defense University, of the deep damage caused to Hezbollah that he said diminished Iran\\'s capacity to strike at Israel\\'s borders.\\nMore:\\'Iran made a big mistake\\': Israel promises revenge after missile attack\\n\"It shook Iran to the core. It shows how Iran is deeply infiltrated also: they not only killed Nasrallah, they killed Nilforoushan,\" who was a trusted military adviser to Khamenei, he said.\\nHezbollah\\'s lost military capacity and leadership cadre might push Iran towards the type of attacks against Israeli embassies and personnel abroad that it engaged in more frequently before the rise of its proxy forces, Ranstorp said.\\nNasrallah\\'s death has prompted Iranian authorities to thoroughly investigate possible infiltrations within Iran\\'s own ranks, from the powerful Revolutionary Guards to senior security officials, a second senior Iranian official told Reuters. They are especially focused on those who travel abroad or have relatives living outside Iran, the first official said.\\nTehran grew suspicious of certain members of the Guards who had been traveling to Lebanon, he said. Concerns were raised when one of these individuals began asking about Nasrallah\\'s whereabouts, particularly inquiring about how long he would remain in specific locations, the official added.\\nThe individual has been arrested along with several others, the first official said, after alarm was raised in Iran\\'s intelligence circles. The suspect\\'s family had relocated outside Iran, the official said, without identifying the suspect or his relatives.\\nThe second official said the assassination has spread mistrust between Tehran and Hezbollah, and within Hezbollah.\\n\"The trust that held everything together has disappeared,\" the official said.\\nThe Supreme Leader \"no longer trusts anyone,\" said a third source who is close to Iran\\'s establishment.\\nAlarm bells had already rung within Tehran and Hezbollah about possible Mossad infiltrations after the killing in July of Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in an Israeli airstrike on a secretive Beirut location while meeting an IRGC commander, two Hezbollah sources and a Lebanese security official told Reuters at the time. That killing was followed a few hours later by the assassination of Hamas leader Haniyeh in Tehran.\\nMore:Spy satellites may have detected preparations for Iran\\'s missile attack on Israel\\nUnlike Haniyeh\\'s death, Israel publicly claimed responsibility for the killing of Shukr, a low-profile figure who Nasrallah nonetheless described, at his funeral, as a central figure in Hezbollah\\'s history who had built its most important capabilities.\\nShukr was key to the development of Hezbollah\\'s most advanced weaponary, including precision-guided missiles, and was in charge of the Shi\\'ite group\\'s operations against Israel over the past year, Israel\\'s military has said.\\nIranian fears about Israeli penetration of its upper ranks stretches back years.\\nIn 2021, former Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said the head of an Iranian intelligence unit that was supposed to target agents of Mossad had himself been an agent for the Israeli spy agency, telling CNN Turk that Israel obtained sensitive documents on Iran\\'s nuclear programme − a reference to a 2018 raid in which Israel obtained a huge trove of top secret documents about the programme.\\nAlso in 2021, Israel\\'s outgoing spy chief Yossi Cohen gave details about the raid, telling the BBC that 20 non-Israeli Mossad agents were involved in stealing the archive from a warehouse.\\nKhamenei\\'s invitation to Nasrallah to relocate to Iran came after thousands of pagers and walkie talkies used by Hezbollah blew up in deadly attacks on Sept. 17 and 18, the first official said. The attacks have been widely attributed to Israel, although it has not officially claimed responsibility.\\nNasrallah, however, was confident in his security and trusted his inner circle completely, the official said, despite Tehran\\'s serious concerns about potential infiltrators within Hezbollah\\'s ranks.\\nKhamenei tried a second time, relaying another message through Nilforoushan to Nasrallah last week, imploring him to leave Lebanon and relocate to Iran as a safer location. But Nasrallah insisted on staying in Lebanon, the official said.\\nSeveral high-level meetings were held in Tehran following the pager blasts to discuss Hezbollah and Nasrallah\\'s safety, the official said, but declined to say who attended those meetings.\\nSimultaneously, in Lebanon, Hezbollah began conducting a major investigation to purge Israeli spies among them, questioning hundreds of members after the pager detonations, three sources in Lebanon told Reuters.\\nSheikh Nabil Kaouk, a senior Hezbollah official, was leading the investigation, a Hezbollah source said. The probe was progressing rapidly, the source said, before an Israeli raid killed him a day after Nasrallah\\'s assassination. Another raid earlier last week had targeted other senior Hezbollah commanders, some of who were involved in the inquiry.\\nKaouk had summoned for questioning Hezbollah officials involved in logistics and others \"who participated, mediated and received offers on pagers and walkie-talkies,\" the source said.\\nA \"deeper and comprehensive inquiry\" and purge were now needed after the killing of Nasrallah and other commanders, the source said.\\nMore:Israel launches ground invasion in Lebanon with \\'limited\\' raids on Hezbollah\\nAli al-Amin, the editor-in-chief for Janoubia, a news site based that focuses on the Shi\\'ite community and Hezbollah, said reports indicated Hezbollah detained hundreds of people for questioning after the pagers disasster.\\nHezbollah is reeling from Nasrallah\\'s killing in his deep bunker in a command headquarters, shocked at how successfully Israel penetrated the group, seven sources said.\\nMohanad Hage Ali, deputy research director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut, with a focus on Iran and Hezbollah, described the offensive as \"the biggest intelligence infiltration by Israel\" since Hezbollah was founded in the 1980s.\\nThe current Israeli escalation follows almost a year of cross-border fighting after Hezbollah began rocket attacks in support of its ally Hamas. The Palestinian group killed 1,200 people and seized 250 hostages in an attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, according to Israeli tallies.\\nIn Gaza, Israel\\'s retaliation has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza health ministry.\\nThe Israeli offensive and fear of more attacks on Hezbollah have also prevented the Iranian-backed group from organizing a nationwide funeral on a scale reflecting Nasrallah\\'s religious and leadership status, according to four sources familiar with the debate within Hezbollah.\\n\"No one can authorize a funeral in these circumstances,\\' one Hezbollah source said, lamenting the situation in which officials and religious leaders could not come forward to properly honor the late leader.\\nSeveral commanders killed last week were buried discreetly on Monday, with plans for a proper religious ceremony when the conflict ends.\\nHezbollah is mulling the option of securing a religious decree to bury Nasrallah temporarily and hold an official funeral when the situation permits, the four Lebanese sources said.\\nHezbollah has refrained from officially appointing a successor to Nasrallah, possibly to avoid making his replacement a target for an Israeli assassination, they said.',\n",

       "   'excerpt': 'On Sunday, Trump and other top Republicans framed the election in existential terms and urged supporters to vote.',\n",
       "   'summary': 'JUNEAU – Former President Donald Trump rallied supporters in Dodge County for nearly two hours Sunday in his fourth Wisconsin event in nine days as he and Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris crisscross this critical swing state ahead of next month\\'s election.\\nThe rally at the Dodge County Airport followed events Trump held Tuesday in the Democratic strongholds of Dane County and Milwaukee and an event Sept. 28 in Prairie du Chien in southwestern Wisconsin.\\nOn Sunday, Trump and other top Republicans framed the election in existential terms and urged supporters to vote.\\n\"If we lose this election, this country is finished. I really believe that this country is finished,\" Trump told the crowd that a campaign official estimated to number 17,000.\\nWith less than a month until Election Day, Trump encouraged people to return their mail-in absentee ballots \"as soon as you can\" or use in-person absentee voting opportunities, also known as early voting, beginning Oct. 22 in Wisconsin.\\nHe called the large crowd gathered Sunday \"the ultimate poll.\" Most polls show a one or two-point race between Trump and Harris in Wisconsin, according to \\u2060RealClearPolling.com. The most recent Marquette Law School poll showed Harris with a 4-point edge in Wisconsin, within the survey\\'s margin of error.\\n\"They say that Wisconsin is probably the toughest of the swing states to win. I don\\'t think so at all, we have got the biggest crowds,\" Trump said. \"If we get just the people here to vote, I think we win.\"\\nTrump brought U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson and U.S. Rep. Bryan Steil up on stage, joking \"we have plenty of time. It\\'s a Sunday, right?\"\\nJohnson thanked Trump for his \"new alliance\" with Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who suspended his independent presidential campaign and backed Trump in August.\\n\"You are right about the enemy within. They are dividing us on purpose. They are destroying this nation. And by aligning with Bobby Kennedy, you are setting the example. The two of you set the differences aside,\" Johnson said.\\nTrump also took a brief swipe at Wisconsin\\'s Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, who has not yet announced whether he will run for reelection in 2026, though he has hinted at a third term.\\n\"I do hear just one thing about him, he doesn\\'t work hard. That\\'s the only thing I hear about him,\" Trump said. \"He\\'s a lousy governor. I guess they\\'ll work on that next cycle.\"\\nIn the Marquette University Law School poll released last week, Evers\\' job approval was at 48% and disapproval was at 46%. That was the first time since November 2023 that his approval rating dipped below 50%.\\nOn Thursday in Ripon, known as the birthplace of the Republican Party, Harris appeared with a high-profile Republican and Trump critic: former Congresswoman Liz Cheney.\\nThe daughter of former Republican Vice President Dick Cheney made her first campaign appearance with the Democratic ticket in an effort to urge Republicans with doubts about Trump to cross over. She said Trump was \"not fit to lead this good and great nation.\"\\nTrump\\'s supporters who commented on Cheney\\'s decision Sunday did not take kindly to it.\\n\\'She\\'s a RINO,\\' said Jim Elst, 61, of Oconomowoc, using the acronym for Republican In Name Only.\\nAlthough Cheney did not come up during the rally itself, in remarks before Trump took the stage, Eric Hovde and U.S. Rep. Scott Fitzgerald sought to flip the Democrats\\' narrative on defending democracy.\\n\"I\\'ve been to Madison. I\\'ve been to liberal Madison, and they\\'re going to show up,\" said Fitzgerald, who is from Juneau. \"We need to do the same thing, because we are the firewall ... to keep this country independent and free. Don\\'t believe this democracy talk.\"\\n\"Let\\'s listen to their whole spin on defending democracy,\" Hovde said, after critiquing President Joe Biden\\'s handling of the withdrawal from Afghanistan and relations with Israel and China. \"What the left is doing to our country, it is robbing us and eroding our great country. We have to take it back.\"\\nThe Harris campaign continued flexing its endorsements from Republicans Sunday, hosting a call with reporters ahead of Trump\\'s visit that included Mark Becker, the former chair of the Republican Party of Brown County, and former U.S. Rep. Joe Walsh from Illinois. Both pointed to the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol as part of their opposition to Trump.\\n\"You don\\'t have to agree with (Harris) on everything. I certainly don\\'t. But if you believe it\\'s time to move forward together, vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz,\" Becker said. \"Donald Trump has pushed me and so many others away from the party that I once believed in.\"\\nWalsh added that being a Republican against Trump \"hasn\\'t been easy. We put up with daily and weekly threats and challenges and hate, but no regrets. Our democracy is worth fighting for.\"\\nBaker added that he and others, including former conservative talk radio host Charlie Sykes, had a personal meeting with Harris and Cheney before the rally, which lasted 25 minutes. Baker said the \\'Never Trump\\' movement had roots in Wisconsin, with Sykes and other statewide figures speaking out against Trump.\\n\"I campaigned for Donald Trump (in 2016),\" Walsh said. \"Like many Republicans at the time, I thought he could bring a new direction to the country, but what he\\'s done since then is nothing short of a tragedy for the Republican Party and for the country.\"\\nIn a speech that repeated many of the points he made during his Waunakee and Milwaukee stops last week, Trump spent much of his time attacking Harris on topics like immigration, the war in Ukraine and inflation.\\n\"This country is in big trouble. We\\'re a failing nation. We\\'re a nation in decline. We\\'re a nation in distress. We\\'re going to get it fixed very quickly,\" Trump said, calling Harris \"worse than Biden.\"\\nTrump spent parts of his speech criticizing the administration\\'s response to Hurricane Helene.\\n\"Kamala Harris has left them stranded. This is the worst response to a storm or a catastrophe or a hurricane that we\\'ve ever seen,\" Trump said in part. \"The federal government, the White House is doing nothing. They\\'ve abandoned us.\"\\nFEMA has a webpage debunking misinformation surrounding the hurricane response, confirming that FEMA has enough money for immediate response and recovery needs, and no funding has been diverted for international efforts or border-related issues.\\nFederal assistance for survivors has surpassed $137 million, FEMA said Sunday. Nearly 7,000 federal workers are deployed, including FEMA staff.\\nWhile Trump typically rails on the \"fake media\" at his rallies, he did so more than usual on Sunday. He said he would move the media area further to the back if cameras weren\\'t already at their maximum distance.\\nHe repeated that voters will \"only have to vote this one time,\" adding he has to be careful with the line. Some interpreted that statement as anti-democratic. He also claimed the media \\u2060took his comment about \"being a dictator\" on his first day in office out of context.\\n\"But after that, I never want to be a dictator,\" he said.\\nSupporters ranged in age and hailed from different hometowns but listed similar concerns that were fueling their plans to vote for Trump: the southern U.S. border and the economy.\\nSydney Roedl, 17, of Watertown, said she was looking forward to voting for Trump after she turns 18 just days before the election. She said the border and abortion were her top issues and that she had watched every night of the Republican National Convention that took place in Milwaukee in July.\\nSupporters also expressed a desire to show Trump they were backing him.\\nLouie LaPorte, 36, of Watertown said she had not been all that interested in politics until Trump was shot in an assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania in July. On Saturday, Trump returned to the same rally site.\\nLaPorte said Trump has \\'literally taken a bullet for us.\\'\\nShe said she had skipped church to come to the rally. There wasn\\'t anything specific she was hoping to hear from him.\\n\\'I am just here really to support him,\\' she said, again mentioning the attempted assassination.\\nThose who spoke with the Journal Sentinel didn\\'t plan to leave even if the rally continued past the beginning of the afternoon Green Bay Packers game, which started at 3:25 p.m.\\nStill, by the time Trump had been speaking for more than 90 minutes, some members of the crowd began leaving. Those who remained were still engaged in his speech.\\nTrump\\'s speech at a few minutes shy of two hours ended just as the first quarter of the Packers-Los Angeles Rams game concluded.\\n(This story has been updated to add a photo or video and new information.)\\nAlison Dirr can be reached at adirr@jrn.com.

       "   'summary': 'A cyclist is demanding change after a wire strung across Lincoln Memorial Drive by an Orthodox Jewish group fell and struck him in the neck.\\nRabbi Yisroel Lein, of Chabad of the East Side, said the wire was repaired quickly, and he will abide by any changes Milwaukee County officials dictate about the placement of the wire. It is part of a miles-long perimeter of cables around Milwaukee\\'s east side that Lein said is inspected weekly.\\nThe eruv, as the perimeter is called, eases Orthodox Jewish residents\\' Shabbat restrictions. It\\'s a response to a Torah law that prohibits carrying items outside a private space such as a home on Saturdays. The perimeter acts as a symbolic boundary that extends the \"home\" to the broader neighborhood, allowing Orthodox families to push strollers, walk dogs and carry bags.\\nStill, Ronald Ekker, the cyclist who was injured, argues the thin wires pose a \"public safety risk\" if they fall.\\n\"Public safety should take precedent whatever anybody\\'s religious belief\" is, Ekker said.\\nEkker said he was riding his electric bike down a hill on Lincoln Memorial Drive near the Linnwood Water Treatment Plant on Sept. 18, reaching up to 25 mph, when a wire snagged around his neck. It was attached on one end to a light post and had detached from another anchor on the other side of the four-lane road.\\nSo when he ran into it, the entire roughly 60 feet of wire skated across his neck, he said, leaving marks on the front, side and back of his neck.\\n\"It happened so fast, you couldn\\'t really see it because it\\'s so thin,\" Ekker said. \"Quite frankly, I thought I was going to be decapitated.\"\\nEkker didn\\'t know about the eruv and believed for days it was a booby trap or prank of some kind. He spoke to local TV news stations about the wire without knowing it was placed there for religious reasons.\\nLein called Ekker to personally apologize, and Ekker accepted his apology, but he was not swayed from his belief that thin, nearly invisible wires such as the one that injured him are \"beyond common sense.\"\\nMore: A new eruv that is going up in the North Shore will ease Shabbat restrictions for Orthodox Jews\\nThe eruv strung around the east side was put up over the course of several years and completed in 2023, according to the Wisconsin Jewish Chronicle. The segment of wire that Ekker encountered had been up for three years, Lein said.\\nLein guesses that a large truck carrying equipment to the road construction zone at the corner of Lincoln Memorial and Lake drives hit the wire and caused it to fall. Typically large trucks don\\'t drive in that area, he said.\\n\"It was really a freak accident,\" Lein said. \"We\\'re not in control over everything, unfortunately.\"\\nThis is the third time an eruv wire has fallen across roads on the east side in recent years, Lein said. In the other two cases, a truck and a tree branch were to blame.\\n\"Anytime there\\'s a break in the cable anywhere, it gets repaired immediately,\" Lein said. He added that a crew of people checks the eruv weekly to ensure it is intact, since a broken boundary would mean Orthodox residents couldn\\'t move around outside on Shabbat.\\nThe east side eruv encompasses about 5 square miles, according to the Jewish Chronicle, and includes the upper east side, Shorewood and part of Whitefish Bay. There are also eruvs in Mequon, Bayside, Glendale and Milwaukee\\'s Sherman Park neighborhood.\\nSince the land where Ekker was injured is managed by Milwaukee County, Lein said county attorneys are determining whether a wire over the road poses too much of a liability. If it does, and they ask him to move it, he will, he said.\\n\"We will definitely make any effort to mitigate any of those possibilities for injury,\" he said.\\n(This story was updated to meet our standards and to add video)',\n",

More than that, how we understand, and provide coverage for, mental illness in the workforce is chambered to the past. It reflects a mindset, articulated by one neuropsychologist who spoke with the Journal Sentinel, that a mental illness diagnosis used to be forever, something you didn\\'t come back from the way you could come back from, say, a broken femur.\\nEven the language embedded in disability policies, with references to a \"mental/nervous limitation,\" is a nod to an outdated understanding of behavioral health.\\nIn Milwaukee, the 1980 \"Black and Blue\" tour lived up to its billing.\\nThe Oct. 9, 1980, concert by heavy-metal legends Black Sabbath and Blue Oyster Cult ended with one injured musician, about 9,000 frustrated fans, a battered Milwaukee Arena, more than 160 arrests — and a ban on hard rock at what was then Milwaukee\\'s biggest indoor music venue.\\nA long delay between sets prompted some unruly behavior and eventually someone in the crowd threw a beer bottle that hit Black Sabbath bassist Geezer Butler in the head.\\nIt all went to hell from there, but made for a memorable night if nothing else.

In Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance\\'s rebuttal, he argued Donald Trump could bring \"peace through strength.\"\\nHere is what else to know about their answers:\\nDebate live coverage:JD Vance, Tim Walz battle over abortion rights, economy\\n\"Iran is closer to a nuclear weapon than they were before, because of Donald Trump\\'s fickle leadership,\" Walz said.\\nTrump has said Iran has been targeting him as supposed payback over his former administration\\'s hardline tactics, including pulling out of the Iranian nuclear deal. In 2018, Trump decided to re-impose sanctions on Tehran, saying the deal, negotiated under former President Barack Obama, was \"horrible, one-sided.\" The move angered allies.\\nVance tried to shift the foreign policy blame back on Harris as she served in the White House over the past four years.\\nBut Vance also said twice that Trump would bring \"peace through strength.\"\\n\"Donald Trump recognized that for people to fear the United States, you needed peace through strength,\" he said. \"They needed to recognize that if they got out of line, the United States, global leadership would put stability and peace back in the world.\"\\nFormer Republican President Ronald Reagan touted this foreign policy doctrine during his presidency as he increased defense spending by 35% and tried to improve relations with the Soviet Union.\\nTune into the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate on Tuesday, Oct. 1, at 9 p.m. ET on CBS or simulcast on www.usatoday.com.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'The National Hurricane Center said Wednesday that Hurricane Kirk is \"strengthening and forecast to grow larger,\" although current forecast models show the system curving north and into the middle of the Atlantic, well away from the U.S. coast.\\nThe hurricane center said Wednesday morning Kirk was located about 1,200 miles west of the Cabo Verde Islands with maximum sustained winds near 80 mph, with higher gusts, and is expected to move northwestward for the next few days.\\n\"Additional strengthening is forecast during the next few days, and Kirk is expected to become a major hurricane by Thursday,\" the NHC said in an advisory Wednesday morning.\\nAlthough Kirk will be turning north and staying over the open Atlantic, long-period swell from the large hurricane could reach all the way to the U.S. Eastern Seaboard – from the Mid-Atlantic into coastal areas of the Northeast – by early to middle of next week, meteorologist Michael Lowry, a hurricane specialist at WPLG Local 10 in Miami, told USA TODAY Tuesday.\\nOctober hurricane forecast:Brace for the \\'return of big hurricanes\\'\\nThe NHC also said Wednesday morning it is keeping tabs on a \"broad trough of low pressure\" that is producing a large area of disorganized showers and thunderstorms from the southwestern Caribbean sea into the southern Gulf of Mexico.\\nForecasters said environmental conditions \"could support some gradual development of this system,\" and a tropical depression could form over the weekend as the system moves fully into the Gulf of Mexico.\\n\"Interests along the U.S. Gulf Coast should continue to monitor the progress of this system,\" the NHC said Wednesday morning.\\nAdditionally, a system in the eastern tropical Atlantic currently designated as Invest 91L is producing showers and thunderstorms that \"continue to show signs of organization in association with an area of low pressure,\" the NHC said.\\nThis area of low pressure was located a few hundred miles south-southwest of the Cabo Verde Islands as of Wednesday morning, and the hurricane center said environmental conditions appear conducive for further development of this system.\\n\"A tropical depression is expected to form during the next day or so while it moves slowly westward over the eastern tropical Atlantic,\" the NHC said.\\nThe NHC says the system has a 90 percent chance of formation in the next 48 hours and a 90 percent chance through the next seven days. If it becomes a tropical storm, it would likely get the name Leslie.\\nThe 2024 Atlantic hurricane season entered its fifth month Tuesday, and experts are again taking stock of a deadly and puzzling season.\\nThe year started with dire predictions of a hyperactive season, quickly followed by the explosive and record-breaking landfall of Beryl in early July. Then came an odd mismatch in Pacific and Atlantic activity a later mid-season lull.\\nBut now, with Hurricane Helene\\'s deadly and devastating rampage across the Southeast last week, any hope of a quiet hurricane season for the U.S. has been obliterated.\\nUnfortunately, there\\'s still plenty of the season still to go, and \"October is historically an active month, particularly in the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico and off the U.S. Southeast coast,\" said Brian McNoldy, a hurricane research scientist at the University of Miami\\'s Rosenstiel School.\\n\"I would say that Helene doesn\\'t really have any bearing on the rest of the season\\'s forecast, but right now, large-scale conditions are highly conducive for tropical cyclone formation in the eastern Atlantic, and we\\'re seeing storms taking advantage of these conditions,\" said Phil Klotzbach, a senior research scientist at Colorado State University. \"We just released our latest two-week forecast, and we are calling for a very busy two weeks, due to Kirk, Invest 91L (the wave behind Kirk) and potentially a system in the Northwest Caribbean/Gulf.\"\\nUsing the storm names that have been retired since 1953 as a proxy for landfalling storms that had great impact, September has the most retired names, with 43, McNoldy said. August and October are essentially tied at 21 and 20, and only seven storm names have been retired from November storms.\\nHowever, it\\'s also worth noting that October and November together have more retired storm names than June, July and August combined, he said. \"So we must absolutely still be on alert for tropical cyclone threats in the remainder of hurricane season.\"\\nIt\\'s also important to remember that it doesn\\'t take a strong hurricane to cause a lot of damage, McNoldy said. \"A slow-moving disorganized disturbance that maybe doesn\\'t quite become a tropical storm can unleash feet of rain over an area and create terrible flash flooding,\" he said. \"The rainfall threat from tropical systems has historically taken a back seat to the wind threat in people\\'s minds, despite being deadlier.\"',\n",

       "   'excerpt': 'The process of applying for disability can be harrowing for people struggling with their mental health. Sometimes, it can be re-traumatizing as well.',\n",
       "   'summary': 'Too many times, Anne Huebner\\'s patients opt to use their much-needed therapy appointments to fill out disability applications.\\nIt\\'s a daunting process, one that usually doesn\\'t reward her patients with good news, said Huebner, a licensed psychologist based in Brookfield.\\nPeople diagnosed with severe and persistent mental illness and trauma are more often denied disability coverage than those with physical impairments, according to the few insurance companies that choose to disclose annual reports on approved and denied claims rates. Such disclosures are not required by law.\\nProgress toward health coverage parity, in which mental health issues are covered in the same way as physical health issues, has been extremely slow. Insurance denials and sudden terminations of benefits happen in part because such disabilities aren\\'t always visible, and psychological pain is deemed subjective. More than that, how we understand mental illness is far behind how we understand physical illness.\\nThe disconnect isn\\'t lost on Huebner.\\nMore:Physically disabled? No problem. Mentally disabled? Coverage is limited, harder to get.\\nPeople who are struggling with mental illness enough to require a leave from work often have trouble with short- and long-term memory, concentration and motivation. Huebner regularly supports patients with debilitating trauma and other behavioral health conditions through the process of making claims for short- and long-term disability coverage, Social Security Disability Insurance payments, and worker\\'s compensation.\\n\"They\\'re often frustrated with everyday tasks and, of course, frustrated they have to fill out these forms that don\\'t make sense to them\" Huebner said. \"Their symptoms will worsen, they\\'ll put the process aside. It seems the process discourages people who are already struggling.\"\\nThrough forensic evaluations, Huebner educates people on the process. It involves a lengthy interview process, record reviews and assessments to better understand someone\\'s behavioral, psychological and intellectual capabilities. But, in doing this work, she also has learned that the process can be harrowing for the individual.\\n\"I will tell people right away, \\'This is going to be very hard.\\' We\\'ll work through that as much as possible,\" Huebner said. \"But some people may change their mind when faced with all that paperwork. Then we have to talk about what other things they can do. Can they move? Can they live with a relative?\"\\nMany of her patients struggle with the wording on the application. Huebner compared it to going to a car mechanic and knowing only vaguely what\\'s wrong with your car. If you say the car isn\\'t working, but you don\\'t know which part and why, it\\'s not as though you\\'ll be turned away. But that\\'s what can happen to people struggling with their behavioral health condition who apply for disability. The odds are often stacked against them.\\n\"Now you have to describe something you\\'re not used to using the words for,\" Huebner said. \"None of the disability forms help clients who don\\'t have the vocabulary, who desperately need help, and aren\\'t given appropriate tools to describe their symptoms. It just galls me to no end.\"\\nWhen they\\'re conducted appropriately, independent medical exams can last up to five to six hours to complete depending on the medical specialty involved, said Steven Rothke, a clinical neuropsychologist based in Northbrook, Illinois. Rothke, who\\'s licensed in three states including Wisconsin, said it\\'s an intense process that evaluates the impairment level of the patient in addition to whether the information being provided is valid (accurate) and reliable (consistent).\\nThe person being evaluated for a behavioral health condition has to be far more engaged in the examination process than if they were sitting and getting an X-ray done, Rothke said.\\n\"Unlike, when taking an X-ray where all you have to do is sit still, in a neuropsychological evaluation you have to pay careful attention and try your best to respond to questions or tests,\" Rothke said. \"For example, these evaluations often include the need to carefully attend to and repeat a list of words being read to you, in which your best effort is required.\"\\nRothke, board-certified by the American Academy of Clinical Neuropsychology, works comfortably with both insurance companies and attorneys representing employees. And being in the middle, he can see the difficult position of both employees and insurance companies.\\nInsurance companies have to be sure that a claimant is disabled if they\\'re to pay out a portion of their income. Employees have to show that white-knuckling through destabilizing mental health symptoms isn\\'t working — that they need help, and the space and time to receive treatment.\\nThe evaluations Rothke conducts are aimed at assessing all the major areas of cognitive ability and psychological emotional functioning.\\nHe\\'s looking to not only answer whether someone\\'s diagnosis is disabling, but whether the answers someone is supplying are reliable and valid.\\n\"One way that this is determined is by the use of validity tests and the examiner\\'s attention to claimants reporting symptoms that seem over the top or embellished,\" Rothke said.\\nThe examiner is also reviewing all medical, psychiatric, psychological and hospital records, Huebner said. Sometimes, she gets into education, employment, military and police records, if present, to evaluate the facts about the person\\'s history of illness and injuries.\\nSkepticism about moving to mental health parity is often based on the fear that it would invite more fraudulent claims, often referred to as malingering, or the act of feigning symptoms to shirk work duties. Currently, people with behavioral health disabilities can only be covered for 24 months, but coverage for physical disabilities can go up until retirement age.\\nBut true malingering cases, according to both Rothke and Huebner, are relatively rare.\\nMost people who apply for disability see their conditions as destabilizing and all-encompassing. Rothke\\'s job is to determine, through evaluations, whether someone\\'s conditions render them incapable of working.\\n\"Exaggeration can exist, even in people with genuinely disabling conditions, and part of my job is to determine whether that potential exaggeration means the results of an exam are not accurate,\" Rothke said.\\nIn Huebner\\'s experience, she hardly ever encounters malingering cases.\\n\"It can happen. But, generally speaking, with the people that I\\'ve seen, so much of their circumstances have changed since they became sick that they can\\'t get out of — like losing their life savings and resources — and they\\'re worse for it,\" Huebner said, \"That is pretty obvious.\"\\nNatalie Eilbert is reporting on problems at the intersection of disability insurance and mental health through a grant from theUSC Annenberg Center for Health Journalism\\'s 2024 National Fellowship Fund.

       "   'summary': 'WASHINGTON – All nine of Wisconsin\\'s federal races will be contested on Nov. 5.\\nBut just a couple of those races — the Senate race and western Wisconsin\\'s 3rd Congressional District, in particular — are expected to be competitive as Democrats look to flip control of the House and Republicans aim to take over the Senate majority.\\nHere\\'s what you need to know about who is running in each Wisconsin House district in 2024:\\n(An asterisk next to a candidate\\'s name signifies an incumbent.)\\nBaldwin, 62, is seeking her 3rd term in the Senate. She became the first openly gay senator when she was elected to the high chamber in 2012. She previously served the state\\'s 2nd Congressional District anchored in Madison from 1999 until she entered the Senate in 2013 — making her the first woman from Wisconsin elected to either chamber.\\nBefore her arrival in Congress, Baldwin represented the Madison area in the Wisconsin State Assembly.\\nBaldwin has campaigned on preserving access to abortion, strengthening Wisconsin\\'s manufacturing sector, lowering prescription drug prices and supporting vetrans.\\nHovde, 60, is a banking mogul and real estate executive making his second run for Senate in Wisconsin. He previously ran for Senate in 2012 but finished a close second to former Wisconsin Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson in the primary. Baldwin defeated Thompson in that race. Hovde weighed a run against Baldwin again in 2018 but backed off, and he also briefly considered a run for governor in 2022.\\nHovde is the CEO of a Madison-based commercial and residential real estate company started by his grandfather. He also leads two West Coast-based businesses — H Bancorp and its primary subsidiary, Sunwest Bank.\\nHovde is running on reigning in federal government spending that he blames for causing inflation, cracking down on immigrant border crossings, extending the Republican enacted 2017 tax cuts that are set to expire and overhauling the health care system to reduce costs. Hovde said during his 2012 candidacy that was \"totally opposed to abortion\" and has since said he\\'s always been in favor of exceptions for rape, incest and the life of the mother and believes state voters should decide abortion policy via referendum.\\nAlso appearing on the ballot for U.S. Senate are Phil Anderson, listed under the Distrupt The Corruption party, and Thomas Leager, listed under the America First party. Anderson describes himself as a \"libertarian activist.\" Leager, a former lobbyist for a gun rights organization, calls for a major downsizing of the federal government.\\nThe district stretches from Rock County to Kenosha County and southern Milwaukee County.\\nSteil, 43, is a Janesville Republican who has represented southeastern Wisconsin\\'s House district since former Speaker Paul Ryan left Congress in 2018. Steil currently serves as chairman of the House Committee on Administration, a panel that oversees the day-to-day operations of Congress\\' lower chamber.\\nBefore arriving on Capitol Hill, Steil worked as counsel for a Beloit manufacturing company and represented other businesses as an attorney. Former Republican Gov. Scott Walker nominated Steil to the University of Wisconsin Board of Regents in 2016 — two years before he was elected.\\nSteil has said the top issues he hears when speaking to voters are the cost of living and the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border.\\nBarca, 69, is running again for a seat he held 30 years prior. The Kenosha Democrat represented the 1st Congressional District from 1993-1995 before losing his first reelection bid. He was the last Democrat to hold the seat.\\nBarca was first elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly in 1985. He was appointed Midwest regional administrator to the U.S. Small Business Administration by then-President Bill Clinton after he lost his congressional reelection bid and eventually returned to the state Assembly in 2009.

She said it\\'s her duty.\\n\\'We have a responsibility as non-citizens and citizens to take care of each other,\\' said Flores, who works for the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign.\\nFlores was part of an event Saturday to mobilize and motivate Gen Z and Millennials to register and vote in the upcoming presidential election.\\nDoSomething, a national youth leadership and civic engagement organization partnered with the YWCA Southeast Wisconsin and famed choreographer and Milwaukee native Frank Gatson Jr. to host the Show Up for Wisconsin event at City Social, 530 N. Water St.\\nGatson, noted for choreographing Beyoncé\\'s \"Single Ladies\" video, brought even more star power to the event — Grammy-nominated singer and actor Luke James of \\'The Chi\\' and Ashley Everett, a former Beyoncé backup dancer.\\nJames voted for the first time when then-U.S. Senator Barack Obama ran for president. He still has the \\'stub\\' he received when he cast his ballot. He urged young people not to believe the fallacy that their vote doesn\\'t matter. He said it\\'s an effort to diminish their power.\\nMore:National nonprofit wants to know what\\'s on Gen Z\\'s mind, get them registered to vote in Wisconsin\\n\\'That was my first inkling of change, when I saw a Black man become president. I really felt the power of my vote,\\' James said. \\'The coolest things you could ever do is to register and vote.\\'\\n\\'People have struggled for us to vote,\\' said Gatson, who recalled a visit to a southern Louisiana town where he experienced segregation. He remembers vividly his mother using a \\'colored only\\' water fountain and a \\'colored only\\' bathroom. Even his birth certificate lists him and his parents as \\'colored.\\'\\n\\'Voting changes things like that,\\' said Gatson, who\\'s now leading a project to turn the YWCA building on King Drive into an intervention performance arts and athletic center.\\nYoung voters have played a key role in winning the White House.\\nIn the 2020 presidential election, turnout among ages 18-29 was 50%, a 11-point increase from 2016, according to a Tufts University Tisch College report. The increase represents one of the highest rates of youth electoral participation since the voting age was lowered to 18, the report said.\\nSaturday, the nearly 30 young people attending the event sat around tables, discussing the issues important to them — from crime and education to jobs and youth incarcerations. But some lamented that the presidential candidates aren\\'t addressing those issues even while courting their votes.\\n\\'Health care is a really major thing that they are missing,\\' said Keontay \\'Tay\\' Burchette, 18, a Milwaukee Area Technical College student and a DoSomething member.\\nHe said there\\'s a lot of talk about protecting reproductive rights, but something as basic as sex education in schools isn\\'t part of those conversations. He said a lot of teens are engaging in risky behaviors.\\n\\'It really is lack of knowledge,\\' he said. \\'We don\\'t have spaces to learn those things. We do things blindly and they refused to put it in the school system because they see it as a problem.\\'\\nAyana Boyd echoed Burchette\\'s concern about health care. Boyd, 25, has diabetes. She\\'s concerned about young adults who fall through the cracks when no longer on their parents\\' health plan.\\n\\'We hear a lot of commercials talking about insulin prices being capped, but it is more to it than just the insulin prices,\\' she said. \\'Just getting the care period. I don\\'t think we have enough resources. And it is not talked about enough.\\'\\nYoung adults have a role in shaping these policies, noted Burchette, who registered to vote this year. Like many at the event, he will be voting in his first presidential election.\\nIt\\'s important for young people to get registered and to vote \\'to force (politicians) to talk about those issues,\\' he said. \\'And we won\\'t be able to do that unless we vote.\\'\\nImmigration and migration will always be an issue for Flores. But she wished that more politicians see immigrants as human beings and deserving just like anybody else. Often, she said, immigrants are labeled as unskilled workers.\\n\\'But without the fruit-pickers, without people that install floors and people that build these houses — day in and day out, regardless of the weather — this country wouldn\\'t exist to the strength that it is today,\\' Flores said.\\nMei Bean, 20, is excited about voting in her first presidential election. The University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire student poured over the candidates\\' platforms to inform her decision in November. Academic freedoms and freedom of speech top her concerns. She hopes candidates will speak more about it.\\nThe University of Wisconsin System recently enacted a viewpoint neutrality policy, which Bean said hinders academic freedom for professors, department chairs and faculties. The policy changes came amid pro-Palestinian encampments that sprung up on college campuses nationwide, including in Wisconsin, protesting the Israel-Hamas war.\\n\\'Some of our faculty are worried about doing research on certain topics because they are worried it would be categorized as political,\\' Bean said. \\'It is a very slippery slope of where to draw the line for free speech.\\'\\nStill, she said this election will change the course of U.S. history.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'This weekend, the scenic backroads of Sauk County in Wisconsin\\'s Driftless region will become a living, breathing art exhibit.\\nThe Farm/Art DTour celebrates the work of farmers and their land in this rural area by \"punctuating\" the landscape with art. The free, self-guided driving tour through 50 miles of farmland brings visitors to sculptures and other visual art installations, musical performances, roadside poems and even a farm machinery ballet.\\nThe event invites people to explore and appreciate what the land does for them, and consider the nuances and challenges that rural areas experience. It\\'s hosted by the Wormfarm Institute, which connects rural and urban spaces through food and art.\\n\"These are the landscapes that support all of us,\" said Philip Matthews, the Wormfarm Institute\\'s director of programs. \"We all have a stake in how they\\'re stewarded.\"\\nThe DTour began in 2011 and is now a biennial event. It draws crowds of up to 25,000 people to Sauk County over several days — this year, Oct. 5-14.\\nMore:97% of Wisconsin\\'s Driftless land is private. New trail will give more chances to explore.\\nVisitors start at one of two trailheads, the Kraemer Library and Community Center in Plain or the Sauk Prairie Area Chamber of Commerce in Sauk City, to pick up a map of the route. Once on the route, people can follow signs pointing them to official DTour stops, as well as to informal pop-ups such as farm stands. Be open to discovery, Matthews advised — and be aware that cell reception is spotty. Budget for three to six hours to see everything, he added.\\nMore than a dozen artists will present their featured pieces this year, whittled down from 156 applicants across 29 states and 15 countries.\\nThat includes Matthew Vivirito, a Milwaukee-based sculptor and art educator, who was selected for the first time this year. He\\'ll showcase \"Framework,\" an 18 feet tall, 20 feet wide piece of architecture made from ash trees killed by the emerald ash borer. People are invited to view the rolling hills through the portal it creates.\\nIt\\'s the biggest piece Vivirito has ever created, constructed little by little in his Milwaukee studio and only put together once he arrived in Sauk County earlier this week. He called it a \"big exercise in trusting myself.\" And although this is his first time participating in the event, the concept isn\\'t new to him: He studied under two former DTour artists, and his own work involves environmental themes and interactive elements.\\nMore:6 foodie places to explore in Spring Green, Wisconsin\\n\"In today\\'s world, we all feel so divisive and separated,\" Vivirito said. \"This is out in a rural place, and it\\'s inviting people from the city to come out, engage with these farmers, have a conversation, and use art as a facilitator to make that happen. (That) mission is really beautiful and important.\"\\nThe DTour also hosts \"Pasture Performances,\" special weekend events that feature other art forms. This year, \"Hayrake Ballet\" by Berlin, Germany-based Sarah Butler is one of them. On Oct. 5 and 6 between 1 and 3 p.m., she\\'ll debut a choreographed dance featuring tractors and hay rakes.\\nButler, a professional choreographer and performing artist who\\'s been working with the Wormfarm Institute since 2020, said it\\'s been special to get to know the farmers who agreed to participate, some of whom have had a family farm in the area for generations. During a Tuesday rehearsal, they were twirling around in the field and doing donuts, she said, unlocking a different way to work with the machines that are key to their livelihood.\\n\"Art gets attributed to something in a gallery or a painting. But there\\'s the art of anything,\" Butler said. \"Meeting (these farmers) and talking about how they attend to the field, when it\\'s time to rake, it\\'s such an art form. It\\'s just not recognized as such.\"\\nMore:To revitalize rural communities, this group looks to food tourism to tell the story behind what we eat\\nOther art installations and pasture performances this year include a collection of antique tractors, a \"Soiled Undies\" display by the Sauk Soil And Water Improvement Group, a reimagining of pivot irrigation machinery as a mythical beast, an artistic interpretation of Aldo Leopold\\'s shack and a walking exhibit reflecting the journeys of people from Mexico and Ecuador who have traveled to the U.S.\\nIn other words, there\\'s something for everyone.\\nBut the event is meant for more than something pretty to look at, listen to or watch. Though it might feel like there\\'s more distance than ever between rural and urban populations — something especially poignant in purple Wisconsin a month before the presidential election — Matthews hopes visitors will look beyond stereotypes and realize that rural places are home to people doing meaningful, eclectic and vibrant work.\\nButler described art as an \"invisible bridge.\"\\n\"If you can get to a space where people are engaged or involved, we\\'re all working together — and we don\\'t even really know how that happened,\" she said.\\nGet an idea of what you\\'ll experience by visiting wormfarminstitute.org/programs/farm-art-dtour. Then, pick up a DTour map from the Kraemer Library in Plain at 910 Main St. or the Sauk Prairie Area Chamber of Commerce, 109 Phillips Blvd. in Sauk City.If you\\'re visiting on the weekend and get hungry, stop at the Food Chain at the heart of the route in Witwen Park.The DTour can route can be driven (or biked, if you\\'re up for a serious workout) from sunrise to sunset.',\n",

Her father, former Republican Vice President Dick Cheney, also endorsed Harris.\\nCheney, who was born in Madison, is one of the most high-profile anti-Trump Republicans in the country.\\nShe was ousted as chair of the House Republican Conference — the third highest-ranking House Republican — over her criticism of Trump following his attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. She was one of 10 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump over the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and served as the vice chair of the House select committee investigating the insurrection.\\nShe was disavowed by Wyoming Republicans and lost her House re-election bid in 2022 over her break with Trump.\\n'As a conservative, as someone who believes in and cares about the Constitution, I have thought deeply about this,' Cheney said when she announced her support for Harris last month. 'Because of the danger that Donald Trump poses, not only am I not voting for Donald Trump, but I will be voting for Kamala Harris.'\\nIn recent weeks, Cheney has endorsed and appeared alongside Democratic U.S. Rep. Colin Allred, who is challenging Republican Sen. Ted Cruz for his Senate seat in Texas.\\nHarris in her remarks Thursday is expected to acknowledge the Little White Schoolhouse in Ripon where the Republican Party was reportedly founded in 1854 and make an appeal to Republican and independent voters, according to a senior Harris campaign official.\\nHarris, the official said, plans to reiterate her commitment to upholding the Constitution and the rule of law and will praise Cheney for her own commitment to the country as Harris attempts to draw a contrast between herself and Trump.\\nThe Harris campaign in recent weeks has touted the support it has received from Republicans, including a number of former Republican Wisconsin state lawmakers, has evidence of what they've painted as a broad coalition of support from those both inside and outside of the Democratic Party.\\nDuring Tuesday night's vice presidential debate between Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris' running mate, and Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Walz referenced the support his ticket received from Dick Cheney, who served under Republican President George W. Bush.\",\n",

       "   'excerpt': 'Rev. William Barber II called for the presidential campaign to focus on the poor, the truth in a post VP-debate interview.',\n",
       "   'summary': 'As the nation reviewed the vice presidential debate between Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz Tuesday night, Rev. William J. Barber II noticed one group of people missing from the conversation: the poor.\\nThe founder of Repairers of the Breach, The Poor People\\'s Campaign and the Director of the Center for Public Theology and Public Policy at Yale told USA TODAY in an interview Wednesday that the presidential race, and by extension the vice presidential debate, was not revealing solutions for the nearly 38 million people living in poverty in the country.\\n\"We\\'re talking about poverty that is not an anomaly among one group of people. But in fact, is across the country, in every community, in every city,\" Barber said. \"We should really be talking about how to abolish the majority of poverty, because we know what would happen if we did have serious living minimum wage and health care.\"\\nBarber was unsparing in his criticism of falsehoods spread by Vance during the debate, including those on the Affordable Care Act and on his position on abortion.\\n\"I saw some of the un-Christian type statements coming out of Vance\\'s mouth. He wasn\\'t hollering, he wasn\\'t cussing, he wasn\\'t being belittling. He was doing it with a smile, in some sense, makes it worse,\" Barber said.\\nBarber criticized the debate for lacking questions about those facing poverty and working for low wages, specifically raising the federal minimum wage to what he called a living minimum wage.\\n\"To not have that as a major question and drill it down and make these candidates answer the question is a failing, we believe of the debate system,\" Barber said.\\nThe last attempt to raise the federal minimum wage occurred in 2021 when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) added a proposal as an amendment to the March COVID-19 stimulus bill. The amendment was defeated when eight Democrats voted with the entirety of the Republicans in the Senate, 58-42.\\nBarber recognized that the Biden administration has taken executive action to raise the minimum wage for federal workers to $15 per hour in 2021, after the Sanders amendment was defeated.\\nThe last successful raising of the minimum wage came in 2009.\\n\"Everything else has gone up,\" Barber said. \"Prices have gone up, the amount of work has gone up, and yet we\\'re in 2009 with the minimum wage. It is really at almost like 1960s level in terms of buying power.\"\\nBarber noted that Walz brought up the campaign\\'s plans for expanding the child tax credit and increasing access to housing, but felt that not having the needs of the nation\\'s poor explicitly addressed in a question was the responsibility of the moderators.\\n\"I think there\\'s a great failure of the press, of those who planned the debate, and even the politicians themselves, for not putting millions of people at the center of the political debate,\" Barber said.\\nBarber noted that the moment when Walz referenced his faith and Matthew 25:40 from the Bible, it appeared the Democratic candidate was speaking, \"from the heart.\"\\n\"The thing he was saying, he was saying, as a matter of faith, there\\'s plenty of clear directions for how you should operate in the political square as a person of faith and who happens to be elected,\" Barber said.\\nBarber called Vance\\'s falsehoods during the debate both anti-Christian and anti-faith.\\nVance professes to be a Catholic, however Barber echoed the message of James 2:26 when comparing the Republican vice presidential candidate\\'s words and actions.\\n\"To be a nation where the leadership is talking about driving people out of the country, rather than being welcoming to people coming in the country, and then to stand up and say, but I\\'m a person of faith. It makes your claim of faith suspect at best and a form of heresy at worst,\" Barber said.\\nBarber further said that the stories that Vance has admitted to making up about Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, which the Republican candidate admitted to creating, were inherently against the spirit of the Constitution and should be disqualifying for voters.\\n\"When you put your hand on the Constitution, you swear to uphold it. That means you swear to tell truth, and what you say is that you\\'re going to be about establishing justice. Lying doesn\\'t establish justice,\" Barber said. \"When you put your hand on that constitution, or on a Bible, and swear to uphold that constitution you swear you\\'re going to promote and provide for the common defense. When you lie on people and immigrants and others, you\\'re not providing the common defense, and you certainly are not ensuring domestic tranquilities, because lies create confusion, and the lies that Vance is telling actually create hate.\"\\nBarber proposed in the interview that in the unlikely event that there is a second debate between Harris and Trump that the format should change.\\nThe reverend proposed a format resembling a town hall with the wrinkle of a non-partisan expert on the topic providing the facts prior to any question being asked by a person affected by the topic.\\n\"You put the facts out there up front, and then put a face on the facts,\" Barber said.\\nBarber noted that CBS moderators Norah O\\'Donnell and Margaret Brennan began some of their questions by citing sources, though the pair\\'s only fact check of the night came when Vance returned to the stories about Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio that the Republican candidate admitted to creating.',\n",

       "   'excerpt': \"Willy Adames broke out of a funk at the right time, and Joe Ross made the most of a high-leverage relief outing in Milwaukee's epic 5-3 playoff win.\",\n",
       "   'summary': 'There was at least a chance Willy Adames\\' at-bat in the eighth inning Wednesday would be his last in a Milwaukee Brewers uniform.\\nScheduled to become a free agent this offseason with all indications that Milwaukee won\\'t engage in a bidding war, the Brewers standout shortstop was on the cusp of taking an 0-fer in his final postseason series with the club he\\'s called home since May 2021. He\\'d gone 0 for 6 in the National League wild-card series against the New York Mets, though things were looking up in the moments after Jackson Chourio\\'s home run tied the game at 3-3.\\nAdames fell behind, then took a ball from reliever Phil Maton, who took the loss in Milwaukee\\'s epic 5-3 win. Adames fouled the next two pitches off and then lined a single to left field.\\nThe two-out base hit brought Garrett Mitchell to the plate, and his two-run homer on the very next pitch guaranteed more game action for Adames in forced a deciding Game 3 Thursday at American Family Field and perhaps changed Milwaukee\\'s entire 2024 playoff outlook.\\n\"At that moment, you\\'ve got to battle. You have to get on base. You have to find a way to get on base,\" Adames said. \"I was just fighting, fighting, trying to maybe get a walk or something, but I needed to put the ball in play and try to get to first. We had to keep the momentum going in that inning. I was able to put a ball in play, and it was good enough to get a hit.\"\\nMitchell and Chourio were the stars, but if this game becomes cemented as one of the greats in Milwaukee lore — and a win Thursday would ensure that — then one simply cannot ignore the unsung heroes of the moment.\\nAdames, the team\\'s home-run leader in the regular season, hasn\\'t hit one since Sept. 14 and has quietly struggled down the stretch, with a .602 OPS in the final 13 games of the regular season.\\nBut the man who\\'s been a mentor to Chourio, whose stardom has now been observed by a national audience, had his own subterranean moment in Game 2.\\n\"I think in the postseason, a homer is a momentum changer,\" Adames said. \"When you hit a homer in the postseason, that changes the whole energy in the dugout, and you saw it today. Chourio … he\\'s unbelievable, man. That guy\\'s crazy.\\n\"We just told him, \\'Man I\\'m proud of you. The way that you\\'ve shown up this postseason, 20 years old. You\\'re a kid, and you\\'re just going out there and performing when we need you the most.\\' That\\'s something, he was just born with it.\"\\nAdames had another play that might get lost in the shuffle, although it required some good fortune on the back end. In the first inning after the Mets had already taken a 1-0 lead, Adames ranged for a Pete Alonso grounder and, despite a bobble, turned it into a nifty double play to keep a run from scoring. It helped that Alonso tripped over his own bat getting out of the batter\\'s box. Chourio\\'s leadoff homer quickly compromised the 1-0 deficit that was left.\\nAdames also made another nifty defensive play leading off the seventh on a ball deflected by Koenig that he converted into an out.\\nThen, there\\'s Joe Ross, making his first postseason appearance since he worked twice in the 2019 World Series.\\nRoss, who hadn\\'t pitched in an MLB game since 2021 when he joined the Brewers for this season, retired four batters late in the game to collect the victory.\\nRoss checked into the game in the bottom of the seventh for Jared Koenig and induced a J.D. Martinez lineout. After getting ahead of Starling Marte leading off the eighth, 0-2, before issuing a walk, he struck out Tyrone Taylor and coaxed a double-play ball from Francisco Alvarez.\\n\"The thing we did with (Trevor) Megill early, we knew it was going to come down to that type of thing, a righty against that group,\" Brewers manager Pat Murphy said, referring to the decision to pitch the high-leverage Megill early in the game in relief of starter Frankie Montas.\\nIn other words, one of the hammers had been deployed early, and someone was going to have to soak up big outs late. That was Ross.\\n\"He\\'s poised,\" Murphy added of Ross. \"He throws the ball around the plate. He tries to keep it out of the middle, and he\\'s poised. He loves the slider, and he\\'s been out there … no sitaution is too big for him.\"\\nRoss was a completely different pitcher as a reliever this season, with a 1.67 ERA in 15 games compared to a 4.98 mark in 10 starts. He had 27 strikeouts in 27 innings working out of the bullpen.\\nHe wasn\\'t alone in the bullpen on Wednesday. Megill, Joel Payamps, Koenig, Ross and Devin Williams combined for 5 ⅓ innings of scoreless relief to give the Brewers a chance to claw back from a 3-1 deficit. Payamps, whose struggles played into a disastrous five-run inning in Game 1, allowed three baserunners to reach (one via intentional walk) but struck out Jose Iglesias to strand all three.',\n",

And while it's probably a long shot for him to play this week, the Packers are hopeful that he won't be out too long.\\n'Just talking to him today. I think we got lucky,' LaFleur said Wednesday.

The way Watson's ankle got twisted underneath Grugier-Hill, it looked like he might have suffered a serious injury to his ankle or knee.\\nThe day after the injury occurred, LaFleur said he was waiting to hear more from the doctors on Watson, but he said he wouldn't play this week against the Los Angeles Rams and he didn't know much beyond that.\\nWatson didn't practice Wednesday and may not practice at all this week. But if the Packers can get the speedster running close to full speed relatively quickly, it would be a big boon to the offense.\\nLaFleur said he wasn't sure of defensive tackle Devonte Wyatt's status. He also suffered an ankle injury and did not return to the Vikings game. He was in a support boot and walking with crutches after the game.\\nLaFleur said the hope is he doesn't have to go on injured reserve and miss a minimum of four games.\\n'I think we got to wait to figure out a couple more days to see where he's at,' he said.

       "   'excerpt': \"Now's your chance to tell state regulators how electric, gas bill increases would impact your household\",\n",
       "   'summary': 'ASHWAUBENON - Wisconsin Public Service Corp. customers have a chance to make their voices heard on how the electric and natural gas utility\\'s request to raise rates in 2025 and 2026 would impact them.\\nWisconsin Public Service (WPS) in April applied to increase the typical residential customer\\'s electric rates by 11% in 2025 to cover a projected $110.1 million revenue shortfall and 4.9% in 2026 to cover a projected $64.3 million revenue shortfall. It also applied to increase natural gas rates by 6.8% in 2025 to cover a projected $26.8 million revenue shortfall. In 2026, it requested another 3.9% increase to cover an projected $16.1 million revenue shortfall.\\nThe Wisconsin Public Service Commission (PSC) will host two public hearings on Oct. 10, at the Ashwaubenon Community Center and also plans to accept written testimony from the public through Oct. 14.\\nMore:We Energies rate increase hearings coming to Milwaukee and Racine. Typical bill would rise to $152\\nThe request comes as rising electricity and utility bills garner national attention. WPS customers absorbed a $9-per-month increase in 2023 and another two more rate increases by 2026 would increase the burden on northeastern Wisconsin households already struggling to afford their heat and electricity bills, said Tom Content of the Wisconsin Citizens Utility Board (CUB).\\n\"It\\'s a really significant increase from a customer perspective from December 2022 to January 2026,\" Content said. \"It\\'s kind of a whopper of an increase.\"\\nContent said household electricity and gas bills should consume no more than 6% of your monthly household income. Any more than that and you\\'re considered to have a high energy cost burden. Spend more than 10% of your monthly income on utilities and you\\'re considered to have a severely energy cost burden.\\n\"We have maps that show in our analysis that more people (in the WPS service area) are facing high and severe energy cost burdens these days,\" Content said. \"We think affordability is nearing a tipping point.\"\\nThe typical electric customer uses about 660 kilowatt hours of electricity per month, which equates to an average monthly bill of $107.43 according to the Public Service Commission\\'s customer electric bill data.\\nWPS says its rate requests would increase the typical customer\\'s electric bill by $10-12 per month in 2025 and $5-$6 per month in 2025, a 16.7% increase over the two-year period. At the high end, the typical residential customer\\'s monthly bill could increase from $107.43 to about $125.\\nThe typical natural gas customer\\'s monthly bill would increase $3-$4 in 2025.\\nWPS in an April 12 letter to the PSC cited the increasing cost of service due to inflation, high interest rates, climate change, changes in regional capacity and more strict environmental requirements. It said the utility, which is part of the WEC Energy Group, needs to raise rates to cover projected revenue shortfalls of $174.4 million in 2025 and 2026.\\nThe company said current revenues do not cover operating costs and some key objectives, including improving reliability and reducing outages, supporting economic growth and complying with federal emissions rules.\\nCUB recognizes WPS and other utilities that serve Wisconsinites need to increase rates to keep up with increasing costs and inflation, and even to make a reasonable profit for shareholders. But Content said the organization also said it identified two ways the PSC could cut as much as $48.7 million from WPS\\' shortfalls.\\nFirst, Content said the commission could cut WPS\\' profit margin from 10% to 9.3% to save about $38 million over the two years covered in the rate request. He said consumers already struggle with energy bills now and cutting the profit margin would shift some of the burden to shareholders.\\nHe also said CUB has proposed shareholders, not consumers, should pay about $10.7 million budgeted for management bonuses.\\n\"We think that should be the responsibility of shareholders,\" Content said.\\nThe Public Service Commission will host public hearings at 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. on Oct. 10, at the Ashwaubenon Community Center, 900 Anderson Drive. If you cannot attend in person, you can stream the hearings online at https://us02web.zoom.us/my/pschearings. In case you need it, the Zoom meeting ID is 809 513 2930.\\nThe PSC will provide Spanish, Hmong and American Sign Language interpreters to all the public hearings, to help all consumers testify.\\nIf you can\\'t attend the public hearing, you can also submit comments or testimony in writing either online or by mail. Online comments on the rate increase requests can be submitted via the commission\\'s public comment portal. If you need it, the electronic docket identification is 6690-UR-128.\\nTo comment by mail, send your comments to: Docket 6690-UR-128 Comments, Public Service Commission, P.O. Box 7854, Madison WI 53707-7854.\\nCustomers should note they can only submit comments in one format: Online, in-person, by mail, etc.\\nWPS provides electric service to 466,000 customers and natural gas service to about 344,000 customers in northeastern and central Wisconsin.\\nWPS provides service to the Antigo, Brillion, Chilton, Crandon, De Pere, Green Bay, Kewaunee, Marinette, Merrill, Mosinee, Oconto, Oshkosh, Peshtigo, Rhinelander, Schofield, Stevens Point, Tomahawk, Waupaca and Wausau areas.\\nIts service area stretches from Door, Kewaunee, Oconto counties in northeastern Wisconsin to Vilas, Oneida and Lincoln counties in central Wisconsin.',\n",

Ekker suffered injuries to the front, side and back of his neck as a result. The wire was repaired shortly after it fell.\\nHere's what we know about the eruv and where to find others in the Milwaukee area.\\nAn eruv is a symbolic enclosure that allows Orthodox Jews to carry items outside of their home during the weekly Shabbat observance, which begins at sundown on Friday and lasts through nightfall on Saturday. Around Milwaukee, the enclosure can be formed by the Lake Michigan bluff, utility poles and steel wire atop streetlights.\\nThe eruv allows Orthodox Jews to bypass traditional Shabbat restrictions because the contiguous wall creates a new public-private space that acts as an extension of the home under Torah law.\\nWith the eruv, Orthodox Jews can push baby strollers to synagogue service and bring casserole dishes to potluck Shabbat dinners among other things.\\nEruvs, or eruvin, exist in Shorewood, Whitefish Bay and the east side of Milwaukee along with Mequon, Bayside, Glendale and Milwaukee's Sherman Park neighborhood.\",\n",

       "   'summary': 'The Milwaukee Bucks, Milwaukee Brewers and Green Bay Packers collaborated for a unique experience Saturday when all three teams sponsored simultaneous Stars and Stripes Honor Flights out of Wisconsin.\\nWith two chartered planes departing from Milwaukee, and a third from Green Bay, the \\'Flight of Champions\\' sent 178 southeast Wisconsin military veterans to Washington, D.C., for a special day of touring the nation\\'s memorials and commemorative sites.\\n\\'We don\\'t know of any other city or effort that brings together the three major sports teams in one day to do something amazing,\\' said Karyn Roelke, president of Stars and Stripes Honor Flight.\\nSports columnist Lori Nickel traveled with the group and posted stories, photos and videos throughout the day. Check out the highlights below:\\nIt\\'s after midnight on Saturday. It was a full day. A pre-dawn flight out of Milwaukee for the Brewers-sponsored Honor Flight, a late, late night return for the Bucks-sponsored Honor Flight. We all feel the same way: It was a day that will never be forgotten.\\nThis was a day of dignity for the veterans.\\nIt was a day of reflection and gratitude for everyone.\\nIt was a gesture of thanks.\\nIt was a reminder of what matters and a chance to be thankful for our freedoms and privileges.\\nIt couldn\\'t happen without the guardians who make sure their veteran is accounted for, comfortable, hydrated and fed, and supported in every way possible.\\nAnd finally, this was a special sports-themed Honor Flight sponsored by our three pro sports teams, the Green Bay Packers, the Milwaukee Bucks, and the Milwaukee Brewers. And it felt like one big team, being on this trip, with everyone working together, looking out for one another and sharing the journey together.\\nA team that got closer together as the day went on.\\nThank you to everyone for your service and your sacrifices.\\nThe Bucks-sponsored Honor Flight has landed in Milwaukee just before 9:30 p.m. and the welcome home parade is immense, emotional and unlike anything else. Thank you to everyone who turned out to support these veterans late on a Saturday night.\\nWe are landing in Milwaukee soon. It\\'s almost 9:10 pm.\\nSincerest thanks to Spencer Jeka who works in marketing for the Bucks, photographer Dani Mejchar and Karyn Roelke for all their help (Wifi passwords, my phone, my stress, my not knowing my boarding pass was in my lanyard packet, etc.)\\nThanks to all the volunteers, medic crew and guardians.\\nIt\\'s 8 p.m. your time.\\nOur Southwest Airlines Honor Flight is jetting back home after a full day. We\\'re all incredibly grateful. I heard that former Packers center Scott Wells is on the Packers flight as well as a few other Packer alumni. Wish I could have talked to them but we are buses passing one another and never meeting. Thanks to those Packers alumni for volunteering.\\nThey\\'re doing mail call on our flight now. These are written letters to veterans. It\\'s a special surprise. The Honor Flight asked the families of the veterans to secretly collect letters of thanks and love for them and give them to us ahead of the flight, said Karyn Roelke, president of Stars and Stripes Honor Flight.\\nThey are big envelopes with several letters inside. Schools in their community also wrote letters of thanks. Sometimes there\\'s a family letter of love that brings these vets to tears, sometimes it\\'s realizing that local kids are learning about their sacrifices in school and remembering their service, sometimes it\\'s receiving a letter from their favorite sports team, said Karyn. All three sports teams will contribute a personal letter for each veteran.\\nIt\\'s 8:30 p.m.\\nOne of the veterans getting mail is Rick Witz who is sitting behind me. We bonded right away because we\\'re both Riverside High School graduates and we want to tour the historic old building. He\\'s class of 1971 and I asked him if he ever swam in the river behind the school.\\n\"Yeah there used to be a rope you could swing on that would drop you in,\" he said. \"People said, \\'you\\'re going to lose your hair!\\'\"\\nHe\\'s a sweetheart. They\\'re all funny and kind, too. Is having a great sense of humor a military thing?\\nMaybe its a survival skill.\\n\"You want to see something crazy?\" he just said to me.\\nHe got a letter from his best friend - who passed away more than a decade ago from Lou Gehrig\\'s disease.\\nI asked him to repeat that. How is that possible?\\nThe letter was really written by his best friend\\'s sons.\\nI ask if I can take a photo.\\n\"You don\\'t want to see my tears,\" said Rick.\\nRick, Bill Lemorande and me talked about the fact that some veterans initially didn\\'t want to do an Honor Flight; that was the same for Rick, even though he has lengthy military service. Like so many if these guys, if not all of them, there\\'s emotions there and maybe some feelings like they\\'re not deserving.\\nBut then his wife Alice and others convinced him to go.\\nIf you know a veteran who could use a trip on the Honor Flight, nominate them.\\n\"If you say you\\'re not deserving, then you\\'re saying we\\'re all not deserving,\" said Witz.\\nThe Honor Flight is completely volunteer-run. There are no paid staffers. Every veteran on the Honor Flight has a guardian.\\nAnd every guardian took an oath to look after and protect their veteran.\\nEvery one.\\nThat\\'s the theme here. Before veterans could take off today on the Stars and Stripes Honor Flight, their guardians were trained on how to make the day safe and manageable for everyone.\\nThe first rule was to be no more than elbow\\'s length away, to ensure that any veteran has assistance with walking or rolling in a wheelchair and with directions on where to go.\\nAnd on the Honor Flight, there always seems to be someone to step up and lend a hand.\\n\\'Over the weekend we had a guardian drop from the flight because of a conflict, so we needed a last minute replacement guardian,\\' said Karyn Roelke, president of Stars and Stripes Honor Flight. \\'Our logistics VP called the next volunteer on our waitlist to see if he could go, and it worked out. Unbeknownst to our VP, that replacement guardian was Nick\\'s co-squad leader in Iraq, and is coming from Minnesota to serve as a guardian for a vet he has never met. So, Nick will be reunited with someone he served with, as they serve a bus of older Marines together.\\'\\nNick Vento, captain of Bravo 4 – the Marine bus - and Jamie Studnicka served together, and it didn\\'t take much convincing for Jamie to serve as a guardian for his first Honor Flight today.\\n\\'If you want to know my \\'why,\\'\\' said Jamie, \\'it\\'s so I can be with friends like Nick again.\\'\\nThis is a bond, a brotherhood, that lasts a lifetime. It\\'s also, of course, to make sure the oldest veterans feel appreciated for their service. And that was Vento and Studnicka\\'s top priority.\\nVento served in the Marines from 2000-\\'06 and Studnicka served from 1999-\\'07 in the Golf Company out of Madison.\\n\\'I get something out of it every time,\\' said Vento. \\'It\\'s a way to show the veterans that didn\\'t get the welcome home that I received; the proper thank you that they never got. And it\\'s to see the healing that takes place at each of the memorials with other veterans that have shared experiences.\\'\\nAll of the guardians, in red shirts, here are kind and considerate, putting their veteran, in baby blue shirts, first in every way, ensuring that they have a good day and a positive experience in what can be a rollercoaster of emotions.\\n\\'It\\'s about the people in the blue shirts,\\' said Studnicka. \\'I truly enjoyed being behind the scenes to help support the guys in blue shirts, it\\'s an honor to be here with them.\\'\\nIt\\'s early evening in Washington D.C., a gorgeous sun-splashed day, and we just made our last stop.\\nSome veterans are very quiet. Some needed some time away from the huge crowds to compose themselves from emotional moments after visiting a monument. Others are very open and direct about what they did and saw and experienced in deployment.\\nIt\\'s overwhelming for an outsider. Everyone has a story, and usually, much more than that.\\nBut Veteran and flight crew Nick Vento, on his fifth Honor Flight, said this tour of the monuments in Washington D.C. is about healing, and explained that was one of the principle values about the Honor Flight, but I wondered about that and joked we could have a counselor on every bus.\\nHe shook his head.\\n\\'Every veteran here can act like a counselor, someone to talk to,\\' he said. \\'Veterans open up to other veterans in ways they would not for family or friends.\\'\\nHe\\'s seen it first hand when he took his own family members on a flight.\\n\\'Veterans as a whole can relate to others that have had similar life experiences,\\' said Nick. \\'Our job isn\\'t necessarily to press them on anything but to be there as support, whether that\\'s simply listening of sharing experiences.\"\\nWilliam Koepsel wasn\\'t going to do an Honor Flight he said Saturday afternoon (it is 3:30 p.m. your time).\\n\"I said, send someone who is more deserving,\" said Koepsel, or Milwaukee. \"I was not in the bush.\"\\nBut his wife Betty said, no. You\\'re going.\\n\"She arranged this whole thing,\" he said.\\nHe was attracted to the Air Force and the aerospace program at first.\\n\"They promoted the Air Force and they lure you in by saying it was aerospace,\" he said with a chuckle. \"Hey that\\'s what I want to be, an astronaut. But actually the airplanes fly in the aerospace.\"\\nHe worked in communications and supported the troops in Vietnam from 1962-\\'66.\\n\"I\\'m very honored to be here with all these heroes,\" he said.\\nWe all need a Ms. Turner in our life. Can we ask her to patrol I-94 for us?\\n\"Get off your phone!\" she yells to a driver.\\nThe red bus, our bus, loves her. If the bus doesn\\'t make it to the site in time the veterans miss out; there\\'s only one day to see everything. She gets us here safe and on time in a huge busy city.\\nIt\\'s very emotional at the Memorials this afternoon in Washington D.C. (it is 1 p.m. your time). Please meet Vietnam veteran Richard \\'Grumpy\\' Johnston.\\nHe brought 43 tiny flags to put in front of the names on the Vietnam Wall of 43 soldiers whose remains he offloaded on the tarmac of the Flint, Michigan Airport while working for the airlines after his tour ended. He knows the names and locations of every one of them and feels it\\'s important to acknowledge them each with their own flag.\\nAt the time, the caskets of soldiers KIA were not draped in a flag because at the time it wasn\\'t military protocol. Grumpy needs to give each of them a flag, in his mind, to rectify this and honor them, said Karyn Roelke, president of Stars and Stripes Honor Flight.\\nHe spoke to the red/green bus on the way as asked for the veterans to help him out; and one of the veterans on the bus said, \"that\\'s my buddy.\" (Johnston\\'s reaction was pure surprise). A veteran on the bus knew one of the soldiers Grumpy wanted to remember today.\\nThey call that Honor Flight magic.\\nAnother of the veterans made sure to find his friend on The Wall and take a photo. Then on another name he said, \"I didn\\'t know ya, but may you rest in peace.\"\\nThe Green Bay Packers-sponsored Honor Flight bus is here on the grounds as well and just left.\\n\"Mom wait up!\"\\n\"I\\'m supposed to wait for her,\" said Patricia Kingsbery, looking back as her daughter Laura Kingsbery snapped a photo of the MLK memorial.\\n\"You would think it would be the other way around,\" said Laura.\\nMeet Patricia Kingsbery, 75, who treated Vietnam veterans who were hurt in the war. She is here with her daughter, Laura, 54, who is her guardian, and she was willing to share her story on a super full red bus in some heavy Washington D.C. traffic. It\\'s noon and we are heading to our first memorial.\\n(We are now calling ourselves the red and green bus, after picking up disbanded members of the broken down green bus. And the Honor Flight motto is to just roll with it; things happen. Stay positive. And that\\'s how everyone is.)\\nPatricia Kingsbery lost high school classmates in the Vietnam War (some of them were listed in Life magazine) so she enlisted at the age of 18, after one year of college, and turned 19 years old in basic training.\\nShe was an Army medic stationed in a hospital in Fort Sam Houston in 1968. She also did some work at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.\\n\\'They put me as a clerk first, but that didn\\'t last, that wasn\\'t going to work. I don\\'t like to type,\\' said Patricia. \\'No, I need to be medical.\\'\\nShe cared for Vietnam veterans coming back from the war who had all kinds of injuries and many were burn victims. She\\'s a firecracker and she dated guys she met.\\nShe met her husband, Kenneth, at a Christmas party, after he returned from Vietnam, got married, had Laura and finished her school work on the GI bill. She became a nurse and came back to Wisconsin to work at the VA Hospital for 25 years. She started as a private and retired as a Lieutenant colonel.\\nShe was deployed during Desert Storm and Enduring Freedom.\\nHer daughter Laura also served and also worked at the VA Hospital in the emergency room. She now works for veterans benefits. She was last seen chasing down her mom.\\n\"She\\'s a firecracker,\" said Laura.\\nAnd a trailblazer. There\\'s a women\\'s memorial here in D.C. - Military Women\\'s Memorial - that Patricia really wanted to see; we were able to drive by it on the bus on a busy day.\\nThe veterans have gotten another incredible sendoff leaving the airport and boarding the buses.\\nOne little snafu so far as one of the buses isn\\'t working. So we\\'re going to double up.\\nAll of us volunteers and guardians were trained and taught beforehand to stay positive in these situations. Stuff happens. Be kind and understanding. And everyone is extremely courteous and polite. It\\'s nice. It\\'s so incredibly civil and the veterans make enough dad jokes to make us laugh.\\nThe plane has landed. The crowd of people here at the airport is lined forever and the people are just so thoughtful. Flags, signs, handshakes. Genuine thanks for service. Video doesn\\'t do it justice. There\\'s no capturing how long this line is. People in the airport are thanking the volunteers as well.\\nHave you ever heard of a water cannon salute?\\nIt is a tradition for special airline flights. And the veterans were treated to one outgoing from Milwaukee Mitchell Airport and greeted with one here in Washington, D.C.\\nA Navy commander who served 25-30 years, Bill Lemorande, has been all over the world in his military career. He\\'s really kind, and funny, and hails from Milwaukee\\'s East side.\\nThe Bucks-sponsored plane has 60 vets and their guardians, a Bucks camera crew with Cam Bauer, some Bucks front office folks acting as guardians, and a Fiserv employee, Spencer Jeka, who is our bus captain (she\\'s a gem, and she needs a raise for how much she\\'s been helping an overwhelmed sports reporter).\\nWe are flying chartered Southwest Aircraft with Karyn Roelke, president of Stars and Stripes Honor Flight, who is also amazing.\\nIt\\'s 8:15 a.m. Saturday and we are in the air.\\nIf you\\'re interested, families and friends of the veterans, and all members of the community, are invited and encouraged to attend the homecoming parades at Mitchell International Airport and Austin Straubel Airport on Saturday evening upon returning from the Stars and Stripes Honor Flights.\\nThe Green Bay plane is scheduled to land at Austin Straubel Airport around 9:15 pm.\\nThe two Milwaukee planes are scheduled to land at Mitchell Airport around 8 p.m. and 9:20 pm.\\nThe Walden High School band and the Franklin High School cheer team will provide spirit for the homecoming festivities at Mitchell Airport, while the Denmark High School band will entertain the crowds at Austin Straubel Airport.\\nTimeline of activities for Saturday Oct. 5 Stars and Stripes Honor Flight \\'Flight of Champions\\':\\n5:00 am – Veterans and their guardians begin check in on Mitchell Airport\\'s main concourse\\n5:50 am & 6:50 am - National anthem by Bucks\\' vocalist Ben Tajnai at Mitchell Airport\\n6:00 am - \\'Green Bay Packers Stars and Stripes Honor Flight\\' begins check-in at Austin Strabuel Int\\'l Airport\\n6:30 am - \\'Milwaukee Brewers Stars and Stripes Honor Flight\\' departs Milwaukee for Washington Dulles Airport, water cannon salute on runway\\n7:30 am – \\'Milwaukee Bucks Stars and Stripes Honor Flight\\' departs Milwaukee for Dulles Airport with a water cannon salute on the runway, and the \\'Green Bay Packers Stars and Stripes Honor Flight\\' departs from Green Bay\\'s Austin Straubel International Airport\\n8:30 am - 10:00 am (ET) – Flights arrive at Dulles Airport and Reagan Int\\'l Airport, load buses for DC tour\\n5:00 - 6:30 pm (ET) – Return to DC airports, load planes for departure back to MKE\\n8:00 pm (CT, approximate MKE) 9:15 (CT, approximately, Green Bay) and 9:20 pm (CT, approximate MKE) – Return flights land, veterans deplane for parades through the airports\\' main concourses.\\nMilwaukee\\'s Hoan Bridge will be lit up in a red, white and blue motif on flight day as a special salute to the veterans on the Flight of Champions.\\nDennis Robinson is on Bravo 1, the Southwest Flight to Washington D.C. this is the flight sponsored by the Milwaukee Bucks.\\nThis is Mission 77 – which stands for the 77th Honor Flight mission to date.\\nRobinson will be 70 soon, he still plays basketball at the YMCA on 124th and he has had a full knee replacement as well as a quadriceps recovery.\\nHe began in the Marines in 1973 in Oahu at just the age of 19 and then transferred to the Army after that, where he served in Fort Hood, Texas as well as Germany, where he did field prep. He was an infantryman both times and served until 1983.\\nHe regrets not telling the military he was a trumpet and baritone player – because he could have been in the MSO band.\\nServing his country also took him to Korea where he was stationed in the demilitarized zone in 1981.\\n\\'I learned about life,\\' he said of his military service. He had been warned that Hawaii and Germany would not treat Black men well but his experience, he said, was that there wasn\\'t prejudice there.\\n\\'I figured things out for myself, about the world – rather than having other people tell me,\\' he said.\\nHe\\'s been a working man with several different jobs throughout his career, and his last job was working for an armored truck company until the knee surgery finally ended that.\\n\\'I\\'d still be working if I could,\\' said Robinson.\\nFor the record, yes his knee does hurt sometimes playing basketball, but he figures it\\'s just best to keep going.\\nThe Bucks- and Brewers-sponsored planes will send a combined 116 veterans out of Milwaukee on a Southwest chartered flight and the Packers will send 62 vets out of Green Bay with veterans, guardians and Packers alumni. The veterans range in age from 65 to 105.\\nWith the assistance of volunteers, the veterans will tour the World War II Memorial, the Korean War Memorial, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the Marine Corps/Iwo Jima Memorial and the Changing of the Guard at Arlington National Cemetery.\\nThe Honor Flight is all-volunteer run which means that 97 cents per dollar donated goes to the flight and operations. The Stars and Stripes Honor Flight has flown more than 10,000 vets total.\\n\\'We are honored to be a part of this historic mission with our fellow pro sports teams from Wisconsin,\\' Green Bay Packers President/CEO Mark Murphy said in a statement. \\'While we play different sports, we all have one thing in common, and that is great respect for those who have served, and are serving, in our military. We couldn\\'t be more excited to be asked to play a small role in ensuring these veterans, who are American heroes, have a great day in D.C.\\'\\n\\'It is a great honor to once again support the Stars and Stripes Honor Flight as we accompany veterans in their Flight of Champions experience,\\' Brewers president of business operations Rick Schlesinger said in a statement. \\'We know this will be a memorable and unique experience for both the honored veterans and all of us at the Brewers. We look forward to continuing our commitment alongside the Packers and Bucks in supporting the brave men and women who have proudly served our country.\\'\\nHonor Flight is a national program with more than 130 hubs from coast to coast. The World War II Memorial didn\\'t open until 2004 and many veterans are unable to visit Washington without assistance. Nationally, hubs in the Honor Flight network have honored over 275,000 veterans with free trips to see their memorials.\\nThis story was updated to add a video.',\n",

       "   'summary': \"Advocates are pressuring Berlin School District officials to change its race-based 'Indians' mascot and logo.\\nBerlin, about 20 miles west of Oshkosh, is one of about two dozen communities in Wisconsin that still use Native American mascots, nicknames or logos for its school sports teams.\\n'The Berlin Area School District is looking at the mascot issue and I hope they take into consideration that it is never good education policy to encourage students to stereotype a race of people,' said Barbara Munson, who heads the Mascot Task Force for the Wisconsin Indian Education Association (WIEA). 'The best time to change is as soon as possible so students are not forced to learn discriminatory behavior. I hope the Berlin Area School District makes the best possible choice for students, teachers and anyone who works for them.'\\nThe focus on Berlin started last year when a district custodian who is Native and a resident, Ashley Lemerand, sat down with school board members to discuss changing the mascot. (The Journal Sentinel is not identifying the former custodian because of concern about harassment.)\\nNot much movement was made after Lemerand and the custodian brought it up, so the custodian decided to protest the school's nickname on her break during a football game in August. Lemerand and others said the custodian was jeered and taunted by many fans. The custodian ultimately decided to leave the district amid ongoing harassment, according to Munson.\\nSome of the fans had argued at the game and afterward that the nickname honors Native Americans.\\nAdvocates for the WIEA argue that mascots and nicknames used by non-tribal school districts on land that was taken from Indigenous people mocks Native Americans.\\nThe term 'mascot' is derived from the Spanish word 'mascota' meaning 'pet.' Those opposed to Indigenous mascots argue that it reinforces stereotypes about Indigenous people, and uses them as entertainment. The tribal leaders and boards from all 11 federally recognized tribal nations within Wisconsin are opposed to the use of race-based Native American mascots.\\nIn Berlin's case, the school board in 2015 voted to keep the nickname after a survey showed that 92% of community members supported it. The logo continues to be a spear tip and a feather.\\nLemerand, members of the WIEA and others have been trying to get the issue posted on a Berlin School Board agenda. Lemerand did address the board during an open comment section of a recent meeting.\\n'I'm here today to express my deep disappointment that the mascot issue was not included on tonight's agenda, despite a Native American employee using her personal time to protest the use of her culture as your athletic identity,' she said during the meeting.\\nLemerand told the school board that its policy of not tolerating hateful or disrespectful words was hypocritical, and brought up the treatment of the former custodian at the game.\\n'Neither the students nor the school staff received any education on why their behavior was wrong, nor did they gain any insight into the mascot issue itself,' she told the board.\\nMunson said the WIEA's Mascot Task Force is planning to address the issue with the school board in the coming weeks. Task force member Harvey Gunderson sent a letter to Berlin school officials outlining why they should immediately discontinue use of the mascot.\\nHe suggested the board should just change it, and not open the question to the community, the vast majority of which is not tribal. That would just make the issue hotly contested, and lead to emotional meetings.\\nGunderson wrote that school districts that have successfully changed their race-based mascots did so relatively smoothly by just removing the mascot, and then having the community decide on a non-race-based mascot.\\nMore:How one Wisconsin school district changed its Native American race-based mascot\\nMore:Wisconsin schools with Native mascots show 'disregard for the personhood of America's first peoples,' state and national tribal leaders say in letter to districts\\nFrank Vaisvilas is a former Report for America corps member who covers Native American issues in Wisconsin based at the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

       "   'summary': \"The Republican Party's 2024 platform makes little mention of gun rights or the Second Amendment beyond saying that the party would protect 'THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS.' Despite that, the issue remains central to the upcoming elections, and many Republican politicians continue to campaign heavily on it.\\nGun violence and gun safety were essential talking points in Tuesday's vice-presidential debate between Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota and Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance.\\nAsked about what he would do to curb gun deaths among children and teens, Vance, who the moderators noted opposes red flag laws and semi-automatic rifle bans, answered that schools should be hardened as targets for mass shootings.\\n'We have to increase security in our schools. We have to make the doors lock better. We have to make the doors stronger. We've got to make the windows stronger,' he said. 'And of course, we've got to increase school resource officers because the idea that we can magically wave a wand and take guns out of the hands of bad guys, it just doesn't fit with recent experience.'\\nOn the issue of whether parents should be held responsible for contributing to a shooting by their children, he said, 'I certainly trust local law enforcement and local authorities to make those decisions.'\\nRepublican voters seem to share the opinions of their elected officials. A 2024 poll from the Pew Research Center found that 40% of supporters of former President Donald Trump said that 'An increase in the number of guns in the United States is good for society,' and 86% said that 'Gun ownership does more to increase safety by allowing law-abiding citizens to protect themselves' than 'Reduce safety by giving too many people access to firearms and increasing misuse.'\\nThe poll also found that 27% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents said that gun violence 'is a very big problem,' compared to 68% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning independent voters.\\nAt the Gun Owners Advocacy and Leadership Summit in Knoxville in August, Trump underlined the centrality of opposition to firearm regulations to the party's base, The Trace reported. He falsely claimed that Vice President Kamala Harris, who is a gun owner along with Walz, was a 'gun grabber.'\\nPresident Biden signed a bipartisan gun safety bill into law in 2022, which encouraged states to pass red flag laws, banned convicted domestic abusers from owning guns, and expanded background checks for those under 21.\\nConservative support of gun rights extends beyond elected officials. The U.S. Supreme Court, with a conservative majority cemented by former President Donald Trump's appointments, struck down a concealed carry restriction in New York in 2023 and overturned a ban on bump stocks earlier this year.\\nThe issue of gun rights is 'something that's very important to us, from a campaign standpoint and an issue standpoint,' Trump campaign co-manager and Republican strategist Chris LaCivita said at an event sponsored by the U.S. Concealed Carry Association at the Republican National Convention in July, according to reporting from Salon. LaCivita said that strengthening a conservative majority in the judiciary, which is favorable to weakening gun safety laws, was his goal.\",\n",

On Tuesday, sleeping or camping on public property in the state was made illegal, and camping areas must be set up to accommodate the homeless community.\\nStatute 1365, formerly House Bill (HB) 1365, will make it illegal for people struggling with homelessness to sleep outside on public land.\\n\"HB 1365 prohibits counties and municipalities from authorizing or allowing individuals to regularly sleep or camp on public property, at public buildings or their grounds, or on public rights-of-way within their jurisdictions,\" said the county\\'s mayor, Daniella Levine Cava, in a memorandum sent to the Board of County Commissioners in September.\\nStarting January 1, 2025, cities or municipalities that fail to comply within five days of a written complaint could \"face legal action from any resident or business owner within their jurisdictions or the Florida Attorney General,\" stated the memorandum.\\nThe camping areas the municipalities are mandated to provide must be approved by the Florida Department of Children and Families and include security, behavioral health services, and bathrooms with running water.\\nHomeless crisis:I lived in a homeless encampment for a week. I saw how Housing First doesn\\'t work.\\nThe mayor of Pensacola, D.C. Reeves, announced that he planned to use $1 million in unencumbered American Rescue Plan Act funds to purchase small, semi-permanent shelters, according to the Pensacola News Journal.\\n\"Arresting our way out of homelessness is not going to solve our problem,\" Reeves said. \"So, having that release valve of additional units coming online much faster than a long process, it\\'s really why I pivoted from the low-barrier shelter that we were talking about.\"\\nReeves was previously interested in using the funds to kick-start a low-barrier homeless shelter, but that idea was taken off the table earlier this year when a report from Jon DeCarmine, executive director of GRACE Marketplace in Gainesville, showed start-up cost would be between $2.19 million and $3.47 million.\\nShelters will be placed throughout the community to increase the stock of housing available and get people off the street.\\nMeanwhile, one agency in Miami-Dade County doesn\\'t think the new statute will help reduce homelessness.\\n\\'We reject sanctioned encampments and believe there is no evidence that they reduce homelessness,\\' said Ron Book, Chairman of the Miami-Dade County Homeless Trust, in a statement. \\'We are committed to investing in solutions that deliver long-term results and bringing new partners in, as we firmly believe we can end homelessness in Miami-Dade.\\'\\nIn the last year, the City of Miami, City of Miami Beach, and Miami-Dade County have seen a a 2% increase in homelessness since 2023, according to an annual census conducted by the trust.\\nIt will conduct the census again in January, as mandated by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.\\nUSA TODAY has contacted Miami-Dade County and the City of Tampa about the new law, but has not yet heard back.',\n",

       "   'excerpt': 'JD Vance and Tim Walz have important roles to play as the presidential campaign heads into the final stretch: Attack dogs, but without messing up.',\n",
       "   'summary': 'NEW YORK – Donald Trump Jr. had one piece of advice for how his father\\'s running mate should spend the next 33 days now that Tuesday\\'s vice-presidential debate was over.\\n\\'Keep doing what he\\'s doing,\\' Trump Jr. told USA TODAY when asked about his friend, JD Vance.\\nVance and his Democratic rival Tim Walz cleared their biggest hurdle of the campaign this week – the Ohio senator sailing smoothly past it, while the Minnesota governor stumbled along the way. The debate will likely be the last time voters see a face-off at the top of the ticket as former President Donald Trump refuses to debate Vice President Kamala Harris for a second time.\\nVice-presidential nominees rarely sway voters or determine the outcome of an election. But both have important jobs to do heading into the final stretch of the campaign: Make the case for why Trump and Harris should be president, and don\\'t mess up along the way.\\nOr, as former Missouri Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill put it to reporters in New York covering the debate: \\'Be normal.\\'\\nVance entered Tuesday\\'s debate in a difficult spot.\\nHis favorability ratings were underwater after many of his past comments went viral, including criticism of \"childless cat ladies\" and the suggestion that women who graduate from Ivy League schools and prioritize work are on a \"path to misery.\" A USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll last month found just 36% of voters had a positive view of Vance, compared to 48% for Walz.\\nAt the same time, Republicans recognized Vance\\'s willingness to serve as Trump\\'s attack dog against Harris and go toe-to-toe with adversaries.\\nSince being picked in mid-July, Vance had done more media interviews as of Wednesday than either Trump or Harris – 127, not including unplanned chats with reporters, according to the Trump-Vance campaign. The Ohio senator also makes a show of news conferences at his rallies, answering reporter questions in front of supporters who egg him on. That practice – while not an official piece of debate preparations – kept him sharp and focused as he faced Walz on Tuesday.\\n\\'We understand that the job of the vice presidency is to be one heartbeat away,\\' Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., who was floated as a potential VP contender, told reporters before the debate. \\'The American people are going to see that JD Vance is more than equipped to step in if he is needed to.\\'\\nOn that, Vance\\'s backers say he more than delivered, projecting a more measured, moderate version of himself to attract undecided voters.\\nNow, the Trump campaign feels better than ever about dispatching Vance to key battlegrounds − and he was already back in Michigan the day after the debate. During his stop in Auburn Hills, Vance addressed a debate moment that already made it into a Harris campaign ad: His refusal to acknowledge that Trump lost the 2020 election.\\nVance accused journalists of focusing on the past, reported the Detroit News, but also sought to instill confidence in his supporters about the upcoming election.\\n\\'To all of you listening out there, I believe that we are going to have the safest and most secure election in 2024 that we\\'ve had because the (Republican National Committee) is fighting for election integrity in a way that it, frankly, wasn\\'t four years ago,\" Vance said. \"So I encourage folks to get out there and vote.\"\\nGoing forward, Trump adviser Jason Miller said the campaign may expand Vance\\'s travel docket and send him to blue states like Virginia, where Republicans see an opportunity to gain ground despite years of losses. Miller quipped that even Minnesota could be in play after its governor\\'s shaky debate performance on Tuesday.\\n\"JD Vance is someone who, with his background, is very much able to connect with people,\\' Miller said. \\'When you\\'re asking the voters to trust you, and if voters don\\'t know you, helping to explain that you\\'ve been in their shoes, that\\'s something that really comes across.\\'\\nDespite emphasizing the importance of a leader\\'s rhetoric, Walz has a lot of explaining to do for his own words, raising questions about exaggerations he has made and has struggled to explain. On the debate stage Tuesday, Walz struggled to answer for embellishing his resume again, this time about his time in China.\\nHis past claims about being in Hong Kong during the 1989 Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests came into question after media reporting contradicted his timeline. Asked to address the discrepancy during the debate, Walz fumbled to give a cogent answer and at one point called himself a \\'knucklehead.\\'\\nIn his two months on the campaign trail, Walz has traveled to swing states around the country and Democratic and Republican strongholds alike. According to a Harris campaign memo released Wednesday, he will continue to do the same in this final stretch before Election Day.\\nWalz has spent significant time fundraising for the ticket while also harnessing his working-class appeal to both rural and urban communities, holding rallies, visiting small businesses, and working to engage teachers, union members, veterans and young voters.\\nDuring his tenure as governor, Walz has maintained a relationship with local journalists as an accessible politician eager to answer questions during informal remarks with the media, press conferences, and one-on-one interviews. But after weeks of largely dodging the press and skipping out on traditional media appearances, like Harris\\' own moves, Walz is now embarking on what the campaign calls an \\'aggressive post-debate travel and media blitz.\\'\\nDemocrats argued that Walz\\'s uncharacteristically shaky start to the debate was not a result of his lack of screentime defending Harris\\' policies.\\nRep. Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, defended Walz\\'s campaigning style and said being present with voters is more important than answering questions from reporters.\\n\\'I think right now, what the people want is for you to show up and, you know, sitting down and doing an interview, whether it\\'s from Mar-A-Lago or whatever other safe space you have, isn\\'t the same as actually taking your fight to the people,\\' Crockett told USA TODAY Tuesday night.\\nThe Harris campaign memo details Walz\\'s plans to crisscross the country to encourage voter engagement while conducting two national interviews, making his late-night TV debut and recording multiple interviews, including an unnamed podcast appearance.\\nIn the coming days, Walz is set to visit the key battleground states of Pennsylvania, Nevada and Arizona before heading to fundraising trips on the West Coast. Speaking to reporters in Harrisburg, Pa., on Wednesday, the governor tried to clean up his debate remarks around China and acknowledged that he needs to be more careful with his words even as he takes a more prominent campaign role.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'Maybe, in Milwaukee in 2024, the October surprise is \"Beetlejuice.\"\\nSpending two-plus hours of quality time with a randy demon and his dead compadres is a lovely respite from breathing in the poisonous political atmosphere outside.\\nThe national touring company of the musical adapted from the popular 1988 movie opened a week of shows Tuesday evening at the Marcus Performing Arts Center, cheered on by a large and enthusiastic audience.\\n\"Beetlejuice\" is well on its way to becoming a cult show. I spotted several audience members in striped Beetlejuice suits and one in a fetching striped Beetlejuice dress. Too many to count: the young and youngish women in Goth-friendly black dresses, in homage to the show\\'s youthful heroine, Lydia.\\nAs the title character, Justin Collette\\'s initial appearance was greeted with rock-star-like fan-demonium by the crowd. It takes a strong comedian to bring this naughty demon alive. Collette, who has an improv background, delivers. He either has a few choice ad-libs during the show or else delivers these scripted zingers with such insouciance they landed like ad-libs.\\nBoth Lydia (Nevada Riley), who\\'s grieving her deceased mother, and Beetlejuice want to be seen. For the demon to make this happen, he needs a living person to speak his name three times. Beetlejuice enlists Barbara (Megan McGinnis) and Adam (Will Burton), a nebbishy but endearing couple who recently died, to haunt the new occupants of their house — Lydia and her dad Charles (Patrick Oliver Jones), more concerned with business and his ditzy new flame Delia (Sarah Litzsinger) than his daughter.\\nNeed I say that mayhem ensues, early and often?\\nTo oversimplify, \"Beetlejuice\" fuses the comic morbidity of Wednesday Addams with the naughty rock energy of \"Rocky Horror.\" (With a few swear words and a few butt grabs, the promoters recommend this show for people 13 and older.) The sets and effects are huge, impressive, frequently changing and apparently complicated — this performance began 11 minutes late due to an undisclosed technical issue. Once it started, it zipped along like a theme park ride.\\nKudos to the strong ensemble, who fluidly danced some of the numbers with giant skulls or other weird things on their heads.\\nAlex Timbers directed the production. The songs are by Eddie Perfect; the book of the musical was written by Scott Brown and Anthony King,',\n",

       "   'summary': 'The hardest thing in the world for young baseball players – and maybe even the veterans – who suffer a frustrating loss is to flush a game and all the emotions with it on the drive home from work, or certainly before the clock strikes midnight. It\\'s just weird to end a long and meandering 162-game regular season loaded with three- and four-game series in a quick win-two wild card. That has a sudden-death feeling.\\nMake no youth excuses for these Milwaukee Brewers. They wasted a golden opportunity Tuesday to beat the New York Mets in Game 1. The question now is, what do they do to regroup?\\nIt\\'s a mental game at this point and the Brewers probably have only two choices to reset.\\nThe first is to meet up, dissect and discuss, even briefly, the miscues and minor meltdowns that happened in Game 1. There\\'s no time for grand team meetings, or pulpit lectures from leadership. But with a 6:30 p.m. start, there could be maybe instead positional conversations that could be useful about handling the approach to tonight\\'s elimination game.\\nAnother way – and it sounds like this is the plan – is to return to American Family Field on Wednesday singularly focused on pregame routines.\\nBut here\\'s an argument to come back with that feisty, confident and even brazen style that has served them well all year. The Brewers have to think this way, even if they aren\\'t feeling like it. Even if they dealt with insomnia or indigestion the night before.\\nMove on, even if it\\'s messy, even if it\\'s imperfect.\\n\\'I think that\\'s the best way,\\' Brewers first baseman Rhys Hoskins said Tuesday night in a subdued clubhouse following the 8-4 loss. \\'Our game kind of makes you do that – just because of timing. We\\'ve got hours until first pitch tomorrow already.\\n\\'Yeah, some mistakes are just simple baseball conversations. And most of the time – at this level – we know already. So that conversation, I think, is more about just getting rid of it and being able to move on to the next game.\\n\\'It has to be business as usual. That\\'s the way we\\'ve gone about it the whole year and found ourselves pretty successful. So, take our chances tomorrow.\\'\\nMaybe you shouldn\\'t read this next paragraph; it\\'s like Googling an unconfirmed diagnosis or a medical symptom. But in the brief history of the best-of-three wild-card series, teams that won Game 1 have gone on to advance 14 out of 16 times. Worse for the Brewers, of the 10 teams to take Game 1 while on the road, eight have won the series, including seven via sweep.\\nNumbers like that are facts and baseball loves its stats, and the New York Mets absolutely earned that mental edge. But the Brewers standpoint should be: so what? There isn\\'t enough history here yet to bury the Brewers – at least that\\'s what the crew should be thinking. Low-seeded NFL teams have made comebacks in the playoffs (Packers in 2010) and Cinderella NCAA basketball squads have made history. Major League Baseball is just waiting for its modern postseason games to catch up.\\nThis is no the time to say, well, it\\'s a learning experience, for next year, for the Brewers. This team right now has the ultimate leader in Willy Adames. This team right now has speed-demon Brice Turang racing around making singles into doubles. This team right now has been underdogs all year and has proven it can win anyway, including against the Mets in 5 of 6 in the regular season.\\nTaking a cue from Sal Frelick would be a good idea. He came back from what looked like a hideous collision with a weird chain link window thing on the right outfield wall last week and had initially been ruled doubtful for Game 1.\\nWhen he smacked a double against the Mets and dove into second base, he already was pumping his fist in triumph. To Hoskins, it was perfect: Frelick\\'s uniform covered in dirt. The emotion is nice, but it\\'s that competitive drive and mentality that\\'s critical.\\n\"I mean, the whole game, it was just a boxing match,\" Frelick said Tuesday night. \"We threw a punch, they threw a punch. They got the last punch in today. And, you know, I think it\\'s hard sometimes, but these types of games, it\\'s really: how do you punch back? There\\'s going to be so many momentum swings throughout the game. It\\'s just, how do you keep fighting?\"\\nFreddy Peralta, Jackson Chourio, Adames and other players said similar things in the postgame locker room. They said they had the confidence that the Brewers could come back. But really there\\'s no other way to answer that question with intruding cameras in their faces just minutes after the loss.\\n\"We have to believe it,\" Hoskins said.\\nHow the Brewers approach Game 2 begins in their own minds first, if they prefer to address it individually and/or collectively. The Mets deserve all the credit in the world for what they\\'ve been able to accomplish this week with their crazy travel/make-up doubleheader schedule and adrenaline-testing endurance, and they dismissed Milwaukee unceremoniously with impressive pitching and relentless singles.\\nDump it and start over.\\n\\'Yeah, we\\'re not going to change a thing,\\' Frelick said. \\'That\\'s why you play three games.\\n\\'We\\'ll come back tomorrow and I think just play with a lot more fire.',\n",

       "   'excerpt': 'The Green Bay Packers have 34 penalties (tied for third most in the NFL) through four games. What is most to blame?',\n",
       "   'summary': \"GREEN BAY − The Green Bay Packers have 34 penalties (tied for third most in the NFL) through four games, including a league-high nine offensive-holding calls and 11 total on offensive linemen.\\nThe Packers had 31 penalties at this point last season.\\nWith that as the backdrop, here's what we asked our PackersNews coverage team:\\nPete Dougherty: The responsibility for now rests more with the guys committing the penalties, but if it continues it's on the coaching staff. When a problem like this crops up, it's on the staff to fix it. You get what you emphasize, and coach Matt LaFleur's staff has to emphasize penalties in general and ways to avoid the holding calls in particular, they've been killer. The rules make the line between legal and illegal holding tricky, but it's up to players and coaches to figure it out. Left tackle Rasheed Walker didn't have any holding calls last week after being called for four in the first three games, so at least one player made progress.\\nTom Silverstein: Usually an excess of penalties, especially contact ones, are a sign your players are getting beat a lot. When you get beat physically, you have to compensate and penalties are the result. The Packers aren't getting beat repeatedly on the offensive line, so it either comes down to coaches not teaching ways to avoid holds or the players are not listening to what they're saying. It is reasonable to think some of those penalties are due to all the movement the Packers are doing with their run game. All the pulls and traps require timing and, when the timing isn't good, it can lead to grabs and reaches. As for the pre-snap penalties, like illegal formation, those are inexcusable and need to be reinforced in practice. That's just sloppiness.\\nRyan Wood: Penalties usually are tied to coaching. Whether it's how techniques and fundamentals are taught, or overall accountability, there tends to be a direct correlation. Which is why Matt LaFleur's unsportsmanlike conduct penalty at the end of Sunday's first half was particularly damaging, and why it was important he immediately owned his mistake in the postgame. There are a variety of penalty types, from physical/aggressive play to mental lapses to what the team considers selfish penalties – such as unsportsmanlike conduct. The holding penalties fall in line with physical/aggressive play, technique issues that should be cleaned up. That the Packers have 11 mental-lapse penalties from false start to offside to illegal shift to illegal formation to delay of game hasn't helped. That may be a byproduct of a young team.\\nDominique Yates: I think it's the been the inconsistencies from the offensive line. When that group is connected, it's really good. However, it seems like, at times, the lack of experience hurts them. The two most-penalized players on the team are offensive linemen. To break down the starting line with Rasheed Walker, Elgton Jenkins, Josh Myers, Sean Rhyan and Zach Tom:\\nTucker Kraft also has two holding penalties. It's a relatively young line and Matt LaFleur has said it's come down to needing better technique.\",\n",

       "   'summary': 'This is the Trech Kekahuna everyone has been waiting for, including the receiver himself.\\nThe Wisconsin Badgers redshirt freshman had a day to remember against Purdue on Saturday at Camp Randall Stadium, hauling in six catches for 134 yards, with two touchdowns, a celebratory call from his parents in Hawaii and a postgame trip to Sumo Steakhouse in Madison with his grandmother.\\nThe flashy slot receiver had been limited to just four catches and 45 receiving yards on the season heading into the 52-6 victory over the Boilermakers, including back-to-back weeks without any catches at all. With Will Pauling hobbled and the Badgers needing a spark, Kekahuna found the end zone for the first time since he was part of the state-championship performance by Bishop Gorman High School (Nev.) in 2022.\\n\"It\\'s a marathon,\" Kekahuna said after the win. \"You\\'ve just got to keep trusting and running. And today, I guess (God) left me some great opportunities, and I\\'m grateful for it.\"\\nWisconsin scored late in the first half to take a 21-6 lead over the team picked to finish last in the Big Ten, then had a chance to double up with the opening kickoff of the second half. And Braedyn Locke found Kekahuna over the middle on a play that he transformed into a 69-yard touchdown.\\n\"I saw a lot of green grass,\" he said. \"But I saw one guy and C.J. (Williams) was enough to get in front of him, to decoy him off that way, and I just did my thing and scored.\"\\nKekahuna flexed for the crowd, the first of two end-zone celebrations on the day.\\n\"I think last week was probably a little bit hard on him,\" Badgers head coach Luke Fickell said. \"He\\'s still a young guy, but he is a competitor. He\\'s what we want to continue to build our culture around. Guys like that who are fearless, competitive as all get-out. I didn\\'t say they wouldn\\'t make mistakes. … It was great to see him kind of step up and take that role and make some plays.\"\\nThe Badgers weren\\'t down just Pauling either, with Bryson Green and Tyrell Henry also leaving the receiving corps depleted with first-half injuries.\\n\"Will and Trech are great complements of each other,\" said quarterback Braedyn Locke, whose 359 yards passing were the seventh-most in a game in Badgers history. \"The lateral quickness and the overall playmaking ability that they have. That was kind of our plan for whoever was in. I don\\'t know if we altered it for Trech or Will, but we want to take advantage of their skill set every week, and it was great to see today.\"\\nKekahuna called the score \"stress relief,\" and it also gave the Badgers a 28-6 lead that suddenly looked awfully comfortable. That left room for some additional fun on the next touchdown, a 25-yard snare in the end zone regardless of the pass interference on Purdue. This time, it was a different celebration in which he pretended the football was a beer can that he \"shotgunned.\" It\\'s very Wisconsin.\\n\"I don\\'t drink, I just did it as a cool celly,\" he said of the celebration. \"All the wide receiver group and O-line said, \\'You have to do it when you score.\\' The story was, I flexed, I was getting all (exicted) and I saw a beer on the front (of the stands), and I thought, \\'I\\'ve gotta do the celly,\\' and I did it.\"\\nThe familiar refrain after Kekakuna\\'s promising camp performance has been for UW to figure out a way to get the ball into his hands, as was the case on a short shuffle pass at the line of scrimmage leading into a 21-yard run early in the game.\\n\"Obviously Will Pauling and him play the same position,\" Fickell said. \"We want to have tight ends on the field, we want to sometimes have two tight ends on the field, and when you do that, sometimes that means you can\\'t have both of those explosive guys on the field or even one of them on the field. That\\'s where you continue to figure out who you are and how you get the best players on the field.\\n\"We know we have to establish the running game. We know we\\'ve got to get guys opportunities. … His (case) was a unique one, too; we were going to play him a lot, we had some things built in for him, but also when Will went down it gave him a lot more opportunities.\"\\nThough his parents weren\\'t able to attend, they did give him a call afterward. His grandmother, who was in the stands, now gets to celebrate with a meal.',\n",

It\\'s become harder for her to understand or even think about the devastation of the last year. Many of the people and things she knew, many of the streets she knew, are no longer there to see or touch. There have been too many losses and separations for herto make sense of.

But as brightly lit population centers expand, there are fewer chances to see it — in fact, an estimated 80% of people in North America can no longer see the Milky Way.\\nLight pollution has bigger impacts than blocking an impressive view, though. It can confuse and hurt birds and other animals, disrupt our sleep patterns, leading to poorer quality sleep, and waste energy, according to DarkSky International.\\nMore:A second dark sky park in Wisconsin was within reach. Then light pollution increased.\\nExperts say everyone can play a part in keeping the night sky dark, even at their own home or business. Here are five things you can do to help.\\nDarkSky International recommends starting with an assessment of outdoor lights on your property. Are you lighting up any areas that never receive night traffic, or duplicating lights in any spots?\\nIf so, consider turning those lights off permanently.\\nIf it's not possible to get rid of a light completely, try setting it up with a timer, motion sensor or dimmer switch. That way, you have control over when it's used and how bright it shines.\\nLight helps us find our way, so it makes sense to illuminate stairs, paths and doorways.\\nReduce excess light by focusing it only on the area you really need. Point the light at the ground, not up into the sky, and use a shielded fixture to make sure it's not spilling over into places that don't really need to be lit.\\nCheck the Kelvin rating on your lightbulb box. Lights with Kelvin ratings of 3000 or less give off a warmer glow and emit less blue light. For homes, DarkSky International recommends Kelvin ratings of 2700 or less.\\nMaking changes to outdoor lights on your property can be a first step, but there are a lot of other lights out there, too.\\nOnce a larger conversation has been started, some communities consider writing ordinances to address nighttime lighting or starting their own dark sky preservation group. DarkSky Wisconsin, for example, started in Wisconsin this summer.\",\n",

'A lot of guys got a lot of action. A lot of guys stepped up after watching the film. Really it was an impressive day and a day we needed in a lot of different ways.'\\nHere are the highlights from Fickell's 22-minute chat with reporters.`\\nFreshman Kevin Heywood's performance held up on film.\\nFickell was initially impressed with the job of the freshman tackle during the second half Saturday. Heywood played most of the final two quarters at left tackle after Jack Nelson experienced a minor injury.\\nWatching the film confirmed Fickell's thinking.\\n'It put him in a situation where he had to play,' Fickell said of Nelson's injury. 'It wasn't a situation where we were just going to run the football (or) we're going to do the things we did on the first day or second day of spring ball. It was like, 'Look, we're still in a battle here, we've got to see what you've got.''\\nMore:Putting Wisconsin football's win over Purdue into perspective. What should the Badgers be encouraged about?\\nTyler Van Dyke's season-ending knee injury didn't just open the door for Braedyn Locke but also for freshman quarterback Mabrey Mettauer, who has been elevated to top backup.\\nThe change means an increased mental workload for the 6-foot-4, 230-pounder from Texas. He wasn't getting nearly as deep into the playbook running the third team.\\nFickell said Mettauer has adjusted well to his enhanced role.\\n'The tough situation for him is those guys were battling in front of him,' Fickell said. 'He wasn't even getting many opportunities to run with the 2s. He probably had a handful of snaps in all of fall camp with the 2s.\\n'And it's hard to learn. Not that it's hard to learn playing with the third group, but even for me I'd say I don't want the third group doing a whole lot. I want to see those guys just play.'\\nThe injury bug spread through the receiver corps Saturday. Starters Bryson Green and Will Pauling as well as punt returner Tyrell Henry didn't finish the game due to lower body injuries.\\nPauling and Green rank 1-2 on the team in receptions.\\nFickell said none of those players did much during the team's Sunday workout but wouldn't speculate on what the rest of the week might bring.\\n'If they're not able to practice it's hard to think they'll be able to perform in a game,' Fickell said. 'And at that position in particular, there are a lot of things that go into a week. It's early yet. We'll find out where they are on Tuesday.'\\nBefore running back Chez Mellusi decided to take a leave from the team to focus on getting his body healthy, he and Fickell spoke extensively. .\\nFickell explained that it's difficult when an athlete's mind and body aren't aligned.\\n'We all that played the game have this expectation,' Fickell said. 'Your mind and body have an idea of how you want to play. Sometimes you can't do it because the opportunities aren't there and then sometimes deep down inside the health and things aren't there.'\\nFickell said he and Mellusi will continue to keep in contact.\",\n",

       "   'summary': 'A European spacecraft is soaring on its way to get an up-close look at the remnants of an asteroid that NASA deliberately crashed its own vehicle into two years ago.\\nHera, an orbiter built by the European Space Agency, launched at 10:52 a.m. ET Monday from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. Ahead of the small craft is a two-year journey to Dimorphos, a tiny moonlet asteroid orbiting the larger 2,560-foot space rock Didymos.\\nThe mission is part of a global effort between the world\\'s space agencies to build a defense against dangerous space rocks that threaten our planet. In 2022, NASA intentionally slammed a spacecraft into Dimorphos at roughly 14,000 mph to test a method of redirecting asteroids hurtling toward Earth.\\nDimorphos, which never posed any threat to Earth, still remains ripe for study two years later. Here\\'s what to know about the Hera mission.\\nThough Hurricane Milton is moving its way toward Florida\\'s western coast, the Hera spacecraft still managed to depart Monday atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.\\nThat won\\'t be the case for the launch NASA\\'s Europa Clipper, which has been scrubbed until launch teams determine a new target liftoff date after the storm clears.\\nForecasts on Sunday suggested only a 15% chance of favorable weather, yet ESA still confirmed conditions were \\'GO for launch\\' two hours before the scheduled liftoff time. The agency also provided a live broadcast of the event on YouTube.\\nHera will now begin a two-year \"cruise phase,\" the ESA said, which includes a close flyby of Mars within 4,000 miles of the Red Planet – closer than the orbits of the two Martian moons. The spacecraft is expected to enter the Didymos binary system\\'s orbit in October 2026, according to the agency.\\nIn September 2022, NASA demonstrated that it was possible to deflect the orbital path of an asteroid by slamming a spacecraft into it as part of its Double Asteroid Redirection Test.\\nLaunched in November 2021, DART traveled for more than 10 months before crashing into Dimorphos.\\nArmed with scientific instruments and two nanosatellites known as CubeSats, Hera is now on its way back to the region to understand not only how binary asteroid systems form, but to determine just how effective NASA\\'s test was. Officials hope that by analyzing the results of NASA\\'s experiment, space agencies will be better positioned to repeat the maneuver, particularly if an asteroid posing an actual threat is on a collision course with Earth.',\n",

The Arlington Police Department determined that the vehicle Bush was driving ran a red light, collided with a vehicle and caused a chain reaction that involved two other vehicles. Bush then got out of his car and tried to run away. When he was apprehended, he refused to perform a roadside sobriety test and declined to speak to investigators.\\nOne of the drivers was taken to an area hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.\\nBush came to the Brewers with baggage when he was acquired at the 2022 trade deadline in exchange for utility infielder Mark Mathias and left-handed pitching prospect Antoine Kelly.\\nThe No. 1 overall pick in the 2004 draft had three DUI convictions in his past, the last of which resulted in him receiving a 51-month prison sentence in 2012. In that instance, he was accused of driving under the influence and leaving the scene of a Florida accident that seriously injured a 72-year-old motorcyclist.\\nHe was released from prison in 2015 and signed a minor-league deal with the Rangers, then made the most of his second chance by reaching the big leagues in 2016. When the Brewers acquired him at the 2022 trade deadline, they hoped the maneuver would help soften the blow of a trade that sent ace closer Josh Hader to San Diego.\\nBut he yielded six home runs in 23 innings with the Brewers down the stretch, part of a broader bullpen downturn that contributed to Milwaukee missing the playoffs. When he posted a 9.58 ERA in 12 games in 2023, including a walk-off home run to future Brewers first baseman Carlos Santana, Bush was designated for assignment.\\nHe returned to the Rangers organization briefly on a minor-league deal before his release in 2023.',\n",

       "   'excerpt': 'Wisconsin would receive $43 million of $2.6 billion for drinking water upgrades and lead pipe replacements, White House says',\n",
       "   'summary': 'President Joe Biden will be in Milwaukee on Tuesday to tout additional funding for drinking water upgrades and lead pipe replacements.\\nThe efforts will be funded by $2.6 billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. He will also announce a final U.S. Environmental Protection Agency rule requiring that drinking water systems replace lead pipes that connect water mains in the street to properties, known as service lines, by 2037.\\n\"This funding not only provides clean drinking water, but this effort is also creating good-paying jobs, many of them union jobs, in replacing lead pipes and delivering clean water,\" White House Deputy Chief of Staff Natalie Quillian said.\\nLead poisoning can carry lifelong consequences, particularly for young children, and there is no safe level of exposure. Sources include chipping paint and plumbing that carries drinking water.\\nBefore the visit was announced, Milwaukee water officials and Common Council members raised concerns that heavy attention on lead pipes could provide residents a false sense of security given the serious hazards lead paint poses in the city\\'s old housing stock.\\nIn 2021, the city allocated $26 million in federal pandemic aid for lead paint abatement. Additional funding to address lead paint is set to be announced by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, with Milwaukee County expected to receive $7.75 million of the nearly $13 million allocated to Wisconsin, according to the White House.\\nBiden\\'s Tuesday visit will come as his Vice President Kamala Harris campaigns against former President Donald Trump for the White House. Both campaigns are crisscrossing Wisconsin, a critical swing state, ahead of the Nov. 5 election.\\nIn July, Biden dropped his race for re-election after a disastrous debate performance and endorsed Harris.\\nEnvironmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael S. Regan said Harris had been a \"significant partner to EPA as we have traveled the country and really highlighted the president\\'s vision, which is a 100% lead-free future as well as helping the public understand the implications of lead exposure.\"\\nA $43 million cut of the $2.6 billion will be allotted to Wisconsin. The state government will then determine how much is awarded to local water systems, according to the White House.\\nThe City of Milwaukee has about 65,000 residential lead service lines, according to the Milwaukee Water Works website.\\nSince Jan. 1, 2017, the city has replaced more than 8,000 lead pipes, Water Works Superintendent Patrick Pauly told the council\\'s Public Works Committee last week.\\nAs many as 2,400 lead pipes will be replaced in Milwaukee this year — more than the 2,200 replacements budgeted, Pauly said.\\nA year ago, the city received $30 million for lead service line replacement, and Pauly said the city has applied for $34.2 million for 2025. He expected that award would be announced early this month.\\nThe water utility is looking to replace 3,500 lead service lines in 2025. It will need to increase the number of replacements annually in 2026 and 2027 in order to meet the 2037 deadline to complete all replacements, he said.\\nAt last week\\'s committee meeting, questions were raised about the resources going to lead pipes and the attention on that source of lead over other sources like paint.\\nHistorical data show that even in buildings with lead service lines, the water utility\\'s corrosion control treatment is \"very effective,\" Water Works Water Quality Manager Michelle Natarajan said.\\n\"The problem with lead is that it is variable, and so any time there is lead plumbing or a lead service line, there is some amount of risk,\" she told the committee. \"So, it\\'s not bad to remove them, but it is a lot of resources being spent on an area where we\\'re not seeing overall elevated lead in the water.\"\\nAld. Robert Bauman said replacing lead pipes has \"now become almost an article of faith nationally, ... yet the actual data does not suggest it\\'s that big a problem.\"\\nPauly said the challenges of abating lead in paint and soil are significantly larger than replacing a lead service line, which he said could be done in four hours. The focus, he said, has in some ways shifted to water and lead service lines because it\\'s a simpler process to address.\\nHe raised concerns that this could provide residents a false sense of security.\\n\"We struggle, as I believe the Health Department does, with the focus falling to water, which is really a disservice to the community if we are not emphasizing the risks from the other contributors,\" Pauly told the committee. \"If there is a belief that it\\'s the water and you get the lead service line replaced and you\\'re safe, that\\'s a disservice.\"\\nA Journal Sentinel analysis of state Department of Health Services data last year showed that the highest childhood lead exposure rates in Milwaukee were concentrated in census tracts that were predominantly Black and had older housing stock and a higher rate of building code violations — a proxy for substandard housing where chipping lead paint is a particular danger for children.\\nThese factors were more strongly linked to childhood lead poisoning rates than other variables, like the presence of lead service lines. Although lead pipes are a known cause of childhood lead exposure, they are present in most parts of the city regardless of demographics and income levels.\\nOn Monday, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin announced that Milwaukee County would receive $7.75 million and Kenosha County would receive nearly $5.2 million to remove lead paint from homes. The funding is from the Department of Housing and Urban Development\\'s Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction grant program, according to Baldwin\\'s office.',\n",

Applications must be submitted months in advance and three hunters must be enrolled to hunt on each property.\\nIn some cases the existing rules prevent a person with a disabled permit from hunting deer on their own land during the special season.\\nThe proposal being considered by the DNR would leave that format in place but make a significant addition to it, said Jeff Pritzl, DNR deer program specialist.\\nPritzl outlined the idea at the Sept. 16 meeting of the DNR\\'s Deer Advisory Committee.\\nMore:DNR begins process to modify deer management units, mostly in northern Wisconsin\\n\"This is one of the things we regularly get comments on, people with disabled permits who would like to hunt on their own property, or a property nearby, but those sites aren\\'t designated in the program,\" Pritzl said. \"So that cohort of the disabled hunting population feels like they can\\'t get in on this.\"\\nThe modification would allow hunters with Class A, B, C or D disability permits to hunt deer anywhere in the state hunting is allowed during the two-day youth deer hunt. This year the youth hunt dates are Oct. 5 and 6.\\nThe disabled and youth hunts both have the blaze orange clothing requirement and allow the use of firearms.\\nThe proposed change would allow more flexibility and likely increase participation in the state\\'s disabled hunt.\\nApproximately 6,200 people hold disabled hunting permits in Wisconsin, according to the DNR. And only about 425 participate in the disabled deer hunt.\\nThe disabled hunt has typically resulted in a harvest of about 200 deer, according to the DNR.\\nThe concept of allowing people with disabled permits to hunt deer statewide during the youth deer hunt was presented to the public at the 2024 Spring Hearings. It was supported by a vote of 7,553 yes, 1,927 no.\\nAt its Sept. 16 meeting, the DNR Deer Advisory Committee supported the rule change by unanimous consent.\\nThe disabled hunt expansion would require an administrative rule change, according to the DNR.\\nThe issue is likely to appear on the 2025 Spring Hearings questionnaire as a DNR proposed wildlife rule.\\nIt would also require approval by the Natural Resources Board. If it receives support at each step, it\\'s possible the disabled deer hunt rule change would be in place for the 2025 fall hunting season, according to the DNR.\\nThe NRB will hold its final 2024 meetings Oct. 23 and Dec. 11, both in Madison. Per custom the board won\\'t meet in November.\\nThe NRB is the seven-member citizen board that sets policy for the DNR. Board members are volunteers who are appointed by the governor and approved by the Senate.

       "   'summary': 'MADISON – Coaches look at the game in their own way, so it\\'s no surprise that Phil Longo had a different take than most on Braedyn Locke\\'s performance Saturday.\\nWisconsin\\'s redshirt sophomore quarterback had one of the best passing days in program history in the Badgers\\' 52-6 victory over Purdue. You\\'d have to go back 17 years to find a UW signal caller who threw for more yards.\\nBut what had Longo, the Badgers\\' offensive coordinator, most encouraged were the decisions Locke made before the plays even began.\\n\\'In my opinion it is a very undervalued and overlooked area of quarterback play and that is the decision-making process while they\\'re on the field just before the snap,\\' Longo said.\\nLater, Longo noted that Locke checked out of the original play call 17 times Saturday. Sixteen times, or 94% of the time, Locke\\'s change impacted the team positively.\\nOne of those checks led to a touchdown pass.\\n\\'That one play is a really good example of what somebody, a quarterback particularly, who is mentally prepared for the opponent,\\' Longo said. \\'It is microcosm of what he does every down.\\'\\nLongo held his monthly news conference Monday at the McClain Center, where he talked about the offense\\'s big day, Locke\\'s leadership behind the scenes, the development of backup quarterback Mabrey Mettauer and the character of his offense.\\nMore:Game 6 Wisconsin football two-deep for Rutgers Scarlet Knights\\nWisconsin (3-2, 1-1 Big Ten) heads into its game at Rutgers (4-1, 1-1) on Saturday (11 a.m. kickoff) coming off the best showing for Longo\\'s offense since he came to UW.\\nThe 589 yards were the most for the team since it gained 595 against New Mexico State two years ago. Against the Big Ten, the total just beat the 579 yards UW gained at Rutgers in 2021.\\nThe Badgers\\' eight plays of 20 yards or longer were a season best.\\nLongo said the performance was the result of homing in on some of the little details of execution that were lacking previously.\\n\\'The players are doing a good job of polishing up some of these little things that maybe we didn\\'t do earlier on,\\' he said. \\'That includes the offensive line. Some of the same plays we ran Saturday hit more successfully than they did earlier because we did a better job from an execution standpoint.\"\\nWhen asked about the development of Mettauer, the backup quarterback, Longo noted his satisfaction with the freshman quarterback but also explained the impact Locke is having on the position group.\\n\\'Why do I bring that up? Because he kind of sets the standard for our room,\\' Longo said. \\'You can\\'t help if you\\'re backing up or you\\'re behind the starter on the depth chart when it\\'s Braedyn Locke but feel like you\\'re going to be challenged mentally every day.\\'\\nLongo also gave credit to freshman walk-on Milos Spasojevic for helping Mettauer get ready.\\n\\'I would point out that the walk-on that we have, Milos, is doing a good job as well and he\\'s been a part of that whole process, so we\\'re happy with him also,\\' Longo said.\\nWisconsin head coach Luke Fickell often has been asked if the offense has built an identity. Longo gets a similar question:\\n\\'What\\'s the character of the offense?\\'\\nBase on his answer it\\'s what you saw Saturday. Nine players were targeted in the passing game and three carried the ball before the bench was cleared.\\n\\'There\\'s four run plays and eight or 10 pass plays that we will call a fundamental foundation of the offense, but the character of the offense is us making good decisions pre-snap at quarterback and executing post-snap and taking advantage of what the defense is giving us,\\' he said.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'A brewing hurricane is forcing NASA to once again scrub a rocket launch, this time for its highly anticipated Europa Clipper mission.\\nThe uncrewed orbiter had been on track to takeoff Thursday on a SpaceX rocket in Florida, beginning its six-year cosmic journey to the Jupiter moon Europa to search for signs of life-supporting conditions.\\nBut that was before Hurricane Milton began roaring toward the state\\'s already battered western coast. The life-threatening storm is also expected to bring heavy rain and high winds to Florida\\'s east coast, where the launch site at the Kennedy Space Center is located.\\nAhead of landfall, NASA and SpaceX made the call to delay the Clipper launch as teams secured the spacecraft in a hangar at Launch Complex 39A, NASA said. The move comes just little more than a week after Hurricane Helene forced multiple delays of the Crew-9 mission, which sent a pair of astronauts to the International Space Station on a vehicle that will eventually bring the Boeing Starliner crew back to Earth.\\n\\'The safety of launch team personnel is our highest priority, and all precautions will be taken to protect the Europa Clipper spacecraft,\\' Tim Dunn, senior launch director at NASA\\'s Launch Services Program, said in a statement.\\nLaunch teams had prepared NASA\\'s Europa Clipper spacecraft on Friday to be integrated with the SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket amid final launch preparations ahead of its mission to Jupiter\\'s icy moon.\\nThe rocket was set to be rolled to the launch pad and raised to a vertical position ahead of its launch window opening Thursday before NASA delayed the mission Sunday due to Milton.\\nAs of early Monday, Milton had strengthened from a major Category 3 to a Category 4 storm, driving sustained winds of 150 mph as it rolled across the Gulf of Mexico.\\nWhile it may weaken before the hurricane reaches the coast, Milton \"is still likely to be a large and powerful hurricane at landfall in Florida,\" hurricane center specialist Jack Beven wrote in an advisory.\\nNASA has been planning for years to send the Europa Clipper spacecraft to Jupiter\\'s fourth largest moon of the same name.\\nBecause Europa conceals a vast ocean beneath its icy surface, scientists believe the celestial body presents one of the best opportunities to understand how life could exist beyond Earth. Scientists have long theorized that the icy crust above the ocean conceals evidence of organic compounds and energy sources that could potentially allow lifeforms to thrive.\\nWith its massive solar arrays and radar antennas, the Clipper is the largest spacecraft NASA has ever developed for a planetary mission. When the uncrewed orbiter reaches the moon by 2030, it will begin the historic task of mapping and scanning above and beneath Europa\\'s surface during nearly 50 flybys to determine whether the celestial body is indeed habitable, as scientists have long suspected.\\nNASA officials have not yet announced a new target launch date for the Europa Clipper, though the space agency indicated that the window is open until Nov. 6.\\nOnce Milton passes, teams plan to ensure the spaceport is safe for launch crews to return and continue preparations. The facilities at the Kennedy Space Center will also be assessed for storm damage, NASA said.\\n\\'Once we have the \\'all-clear\\' followed by facility assessment and any recovery actions, we will determine the next launch opportunity for this NASA flagship mission,\\' Dunn said.\\nContributing: John Bacon, USA TODAY',\n",

Instant Brands, which manufactures Pyrex kitchen and home products, agreed to certain stipulations in 2023 after the FTC took legal action against the company for the false claim.\\nAccording to the agency, demand for the popular glass measuring cups became so great in 2020 during the pandemic that Instant Brands shifted production to China while continuing to market them as being manufactured in the U.S.\\nHere\\'s how to know if you bought one of the measuring cups and how to apply for a refund.\\nInstant Brands has long used the U.S. manufacturing of its Pyrex products as a selling point, advertising its glassware as \"Made in USA.\"\\nBut when consumer interest in home baking spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic, the company struggled to keep up with the demand for its glass measuring cup sets sold on Amazon. As a result, the FTC claims Instant Brands produced some Pyrex cups in China from March 2021 to May 2022.\\nThe company continued to market the products on Amazon as \\'Made in USA\\' even though the cups themselves were marked \\'Made in China,\\' according to the FTC.\\nThe FTC took action against Instant Brands in 2023, claiming that more than 110,000 units of Chinese-made measuring cup sets were sold to U.S. consumers. Instant Brands later agreed to a settlement that required the company to stop \"making deceptive claims\" and included a $129,416 fine, according to the agency.\\n\\'Consumers rely on marketers to make truthful \\'Made in USA\\' claims,\\' Samuel Levine, director of the FTC\\'s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said in a previous statement. \\'If marketers move their manufacturing outside the United States, even temporarily, they must update their advertising to make it accurate.\\'\\nUSA TODAY left a message Monday morning with Instant Brands that was not immediately returned.\\nThe FTC is sending checks to 10,259 consumers.\\nThose who think they\\'re among them shouldn\\'t have to take any action to receive a check.\\nOnce checks arrive, recipients should cash them within 90 days.

At the time, my grandparents were taking care of me, and their insurance policy wouldn't cover me since I wasn't their child. After I got better, my grandparents began searching for an insurance policy that would cover me. But no insurance company would cover me at any price, because I had been branded with those terrifying words: 'pre-existing condition.'\\nSo I spent my entire youth without health insurance, and I realized I wasn't alone. Kids like me, alongside folks with cancer, diabetes or asthma, were also going without health insurance because of a completely broken system.\\nEric Hovde essay:Affordable Care Act made health care worse. We need to move beyond it.\\nMy story is the story of countless Wisconsinites. It's what inspired me to run for office because I never wanted another family to struggle like mine did. I believe that health care is a right, not a privilege. Everyone deserves access to affordable health care regardless of income status, where you live, or if you have a pre-existing condition. And I'm going to keep working until that becomes a reality for all Wisconsinites.\\nIt took decades of work and a few elections, but we passed the Affordable Care Act so no kid and no parent or grandparent has to go through that same stress around having a pre-existing condition that mine did. I was proud to write the provision that allows children to stay on their parents' health insurance until the age of 26. Today, millions of young Americans have health insurance coverage because of that work.\\nMore and more Wisconsinites have gotten insurance each year since we passed that legislation. The uninsured rate even fell to an all time low in 2022. And this year, ACA health insurance enrollment reached a record high in Wisconsin. But my opponent, Eric Hovde, has said he would repeal the ACA if elected, undoing decades of work and putting every Wisconsinite with a preexisting condition at risk of losing their care. We can't let that happen.\\nFor decades, the big pharmaceutical companies went virtually unchecked in Washington as Wisconsinites paid hand over fist for the drugs they needed to survive. However, that ended when we passed the Inflation Reduction Act two years ago, handing Big Pharma their first loss in recent memory. Because of that bill, Medicare can now negotiate lower prescription drug prices directly with the big pharmaceutical companies. Now those same companies cannot charge seniors more than $35 per month for insulin, and Wisconsinites with Medicare will not pay more than $2,000 per year for their prescription drugs. Over 1.2 million Wisconsinites are now paying less at the pharmacy because of the work we've done.\\nBut I'm not going to stop until we lower prescription drug costs for all Wisconsinites. Right now I'm working across the aisle to pass the INSULIN Act, which would build on our work and cap the cost of insulin at $35 for every single American. I am also spearheading an investigation into the four largest manufacturers of asthma inhalers to determine why they're selling inhalers in the U.S. for hundreds of dollars more than in Europe. Already, three of the four manufacturers have lowered their prices to $35 per inhaler. And I'm determined to end price gouging on all prescription drugs once and for all through my bipartisan FAIR Drug Pricing Act. Wisconsinites have my word that I'm going to keep fighting to ensure they can afford the prescription drugs they need to live healthily.\\nAffordable health care can only go so far if it's not accessible or convenient for our families. And I know so many in our state struggle to get care as our health care facilities are underfunded, under-resourced, or far away from where people live.\\nThis issue hit home for so many when Hospital Sisters Health System abruptly closed its two hospitals and 19 clinics in Western Wisconsin. These abrupt closures left families without critical care and eliminated many good paying jobs. When the closures were announced, I called out the Hospital Sisters Health System leadership for their disappointing decision. But I want to make sure something like this never happens again. That's why I introduced my HSHS Act, which would force closing hospital systems to develop a plan to ensure their patients are connected to the health care they need.\\nAs we fight hospital closures across the state, I'm determined to bring new funds to the facilities we have so they can continue to provide care to our families. In the last few years alone, I have been proud to deliver $1 million to Western Wisconsin Health in Baldwin to expand their women's health and labor and delivery services, $9 million for the construction of Memorial Hospital of Lafayette County and $2.5 million for construction of a Mental Health Emergency Center in Milwaukee.\\nAnd finally, I know our health care facilities would not function without our heroic health care workforce That's why I'm working on bills that would protect our health care workforce, expand the hospice and palliative care workforce, and increase apprenticeship opportunities so more young people have a pathway into a great career in health care, especially in our rural communities.\\nI've spent my career fighting to ensure Wisconsinites have access to the health care they deserve. Should I have the honor to be reelected, I promise to continue championing my health care agenda until every Wisconsinite has access to high-quality, affordable health care.\\nSen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisconsin, is seeking a third term in the U.S. Senate.\\nQuestion: Last spring, two hospitals (in Eau Claire and Chippewa Falls) and 19 clinics closed in western Wisconsin. The Marshfield Clinic Healthcare System instituted staff furloughs earlier this year. In the Milwaukee area, some providers are reducing services. Health care systems cite staffing difficulties, inadequate Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements, higher costs and declining rates of patients with private insurance. How would you propose to tackle this problem?\",\n",

       "   'summary': 'CUMMING, Ga. – Rebekah Peltz and Jordon Frechtman didn\\'t know about Forsyth County\\'s sordid history when they moved here from Los Angeles in 2021.\\nAt the time, the COVID-19 pandemic was raging and the couple longed to escape the congested West Coast city to live closer to family in the east.\\nGreater Atlanta\\'s burgeoning film industry appealed to the two entertainment professionals. And Democratic victories in Georgia by President Joe Biden and Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock in the 2020 election made the state a more appealing place for them to settle.\\n\\'We were like \\'Wow, it\\'s a good time to be in Georgia. Let\\'s go!\\' Peltz, 28, remembered thinking at the time of the move.\\nThey packed their bags and bought a home in Cumming, an exurb located a cool 50 minutes from the city\\'s bustling downtown with affordable housing prices, abundant land and a quieter way of life.\\nOver the past decade, droves of people like them from traditionally Democratic states have flooded the Greater Atlanta area in search of cheaper housing and a better way of life.\\nThe growth has spilled out from Democratic strongholds like Fulton and Dekalb County near the city center, to once Republican-leaning bedroom counties like Gwinnett and Cobb, and now further north, where new residents are coming to ruby red Cumming.\\nThey\\'ve helped turn this once-conservative stronghold into a swing state. And Democratic party activists view the increased migration as an opportunity to eventually reclaim Georgia as a Democratic territory.\\nIn 2022 alone, Georgia saw a net rise of more than 70,000 people who moved from other parts of the country, according to a USA TODAY analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data. The demographics of these movers skewed liberal: many were young, college educated and from diverse ethnic backgrounds.\\nLauren Groh-Warg, CEO of the national voting rights organization Fair Fight Action and former campaign manager to Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, cautioned that these \\'demographics aren\\'t destiny,\\' and that Democrats still have their work cut out for them in the state. But they do suggest that the scales are tipping leftward.\\n\\'When you\\'re looking at who you\\'re going to target and how you\\'re going to spend money, that can be your margin,\\' Groh-Wargo said. \\'Those folks are critically important.\\'\\nBiden\\'s surprising 2020 victory in Georgia marked the first win for a Democratic presidential candidate in the state since 1992.\\nIn many ways it was the culmination of years of pavement-stomping work by Democratic activists who sought to register thousands of disenfranchised Black voters across Georgia, and incentivize millions of other Democratic-leaning voters who did not typically cast a ballot in elections.\\nIn 2012, Abrams, then the Democratic leader in Georgia\\'s state house, and Groh-Wargo noticed that there were hundreds of thousands fewer Democratic voters than Republican voters in the state.\\nThey also saw an opportunity: large swaths of unregistered Black voters and \\'a huge number of predominantly Black Democrats moving from the Rust Belt,\\' Groh-Wargo said.\\nTwo years later, they created the New Georgia Project and began slowly chipping away, registering more than 200,000 new voters ahead of Abrams\\' 2018 gubernatorial run and more than 800,000 in before the 2020 presidential election.\\nAround the same time, Atlanta began experiencing a cultural boom. Hip Hop had a heavy presence in the city beginning in the 1980s, but by the mid-2010s, a bevy of up-and-coming rappers out of Atlanta began to define the genre. The 2016 premiere of Donald Glover\\'s show \\'Atlanta,\\' gave further clout to the city.\\nThen came \\'y\\'allywood.\\' A tax incentive for film productions signed into law by former Gov. Sonny Perdue in 2008 helped spur a movie and TV industry in Georgia. Hit shows like \"Stranger Things\" and \"The Walking Dead\" began filming in the suburbs, and Marvel Studios started shooting its massive superhero productions on soundstages just south of the city.\\nAmongst this resurgence, the city was making strides to turn 33-miles of neglected railroad tracks that wrapped around Atlanta\\'s core into a bike trail called the Beltline.\\nLuxury apartments, high-end restaurants and markets began to dot completed portions of the trail in 2015, attracting hordes of new residents.\\nDon Lowell, 54, remembers the changes well. He grew up down the street from what is now Krog Street Market – a former industrial-building turned food hall – and has lived in a one-square-mile radius of the area since the 1990s.\\nA retail manager at a boutique on the outskirts of the market, Lowell\\'s rent has increased dramatically as the area near the center of Fulton County has become more densely populated. Five years ago, Lowell said he was renting a two-bedroom 1920s bungalow for $900. Today, he\\'s paying $1,350 for a studio apartment and is nearly priced out of the neighborhood.\\nThe changes aren\\'t all bad, Lowell said as he ate his lunch at a picnic table underneath a metal awning outside of the market.\\nA true-blue Democrat, Lowell believes the influx of mostly young people into the area has helped juice Democratic margins in Fulton County and contributed to Biden\\'s 2020 victory.\\n\\'No one expected that,\\' Lowell said, skewering pieces of pasta salad onto his fork. \\'It was close, but no one thought it was going to be that close.\\'\\nFulton County\\'s population increased by about 15% between 2005 and 2022. President Barack Obama won the county with 67% of the vote in 2008. Biden topped that in 2020 by more than 10% with close to 73% of the vote and 381,144 votes. The story was much the same in other Democratic counties encompassing parts of Atlanta.\\nDontaye Carter, an officer in the Fulton County Democratic Party, said he views the increased turnout as a result of ongoing voter outreach efforts and Atlanta\\'s population growth over the last decade.\\n\\'If you\\'ve got an engine, and you bring in new parts to an engine that\\'s already running, all it does is speed things up,\\' Carter said. \\'That\\'s what we\\'re seeing.\\'\\nAs people like Lowell slowly became priced out of Atlanta\\'s interior neighborhoods, growth began to spike in the once-sleepy suburban counties that surrounded the city – Gwinnett, Cobb, Clayton and Henry.\\nGwinnett and Cobb now each top the list of counties in Georgia where people are moving from other states. The population boom is apparent nearly everywhere you look.\\nNew six-story apartment buildings shoot up from the ground at intersections, and the small sapling trees around them haven\\'t yet grown in.\\nArtificial green grass and multi-colored Adirondack chairs fill the recently renovated and newly built downtown centers, like Duluth and Peachtree Corners.\\nThe county\\'s Hispanic population grew by 36% over the past decade, according to the Atlanta Regional Council. The counties Asian population grew by 60% between 2000 and 2019.\\nAs the population has increased, so too has the share of votes Democrats have received in these counties. Take Gwinnett, for example.\\nBetween 1980 and 2012, the county was a Republican stronghold ‒ but support was eroding. Former President George W. Bush won it by a more than 30-point margin in the 2000 presidential election. In 2012, then-Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney won Gwinnett by only 9%.\\nA mere eight years later, Biden took it with an 18.2% margin.\\nBrenda Lopez, chair of the Gwinnett County Democrats, partially attributes the monumental shift to the local party\\'s voter outreach efforts. Starting in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, she said they noticed a spike in the number of voters who did not have a voting history in Georgia.\\nNormally, they would have labeled that group inactive voters – a group considered unlikely to participate in elections – and wouldn\\'t have invested as much time or money on getting them to the polls.\\nBut the party realized that many of those voters were just new residents who didn\\'t have data because they had never voted in Georgia. They dropped millions of dollars on targeted outreach to the newcomers, through mailings, canvassing initiatives, and local events.\\nThe energy was palpable.\\nTangi Johnson, 28, remembers getting knocks on her door multiple times a week in 2020 from people asking if she was registered to vote. Johnson had moved to Georgia in 2011 from Ohio with her mom to get a change in scenery, but hadn\\'t felt the political forces in the state as intensely until that year.\\n\\'It was a different experience,\\' she said.\\nStatewide, this year\\'s predictions for the state remain close. Republican Donald Trump leads Democrat Kamala Harris by just over 1 percentage point, according to recent polls, though results are within the margin of error.\\nPolls are rarely conducted at the county level, so it\\'s impossible to know now how close the race will be in Atlanta\\'s burgeoning suburbs, though voter turnout in the densely populated region could sway the results of the election in Georgia.\\nBut Democratic political strategists are all-too aware of the political fatigue voters are feeling. When asked about what the trend of apathy means for the future political tilt of the battleground state, they frequently repeat Stacey Abrams mantra: \\'Demographics are not destiny.\\'\\n\\'We\\'re a battleground state,\\' Groh-Wargo said. \\'Nobody should feel comfortable. This is not easy. It\\'s not going to be easy. It\\'s gonna be a fight for the long haul.\\'\\nRepublicans are also trying to garner support from new residents, particularly those of diverse backgrounds.\\nThe Republican National Committee in 2022 opened a Hispanic Community Center in Gwinnett as part of a multi-million outreach effort to build support for the party. The venue hosted candidate forums and events, including a World Cup watch party, designed to bring the community together though it closed in early 2023 with the end of that year\\'s RNC budget.\\nSammy Baker, chair of the Gwinnett County GOP, said the local party has continued targeted outreach to diverse voter communities through door-knocking campaigns and local events.\\nHe sees the most opportunity for Republicans with Latino and Asian business owners who might respond to the party\\'s economic platform.\\n\"As they make more inroads owning businesses and buying homes and things like that, I think you\\'re seeing them move more Republican,\" he said.\\nThe challenge, he added, is getting those voters out to the polls. Baker doesn\\'t believe Republicans will ever fully be able to win back Gwinnett County, but with greater outreach efforts, he said he could \"see it being half Republican and half Democrat.\"\\nLopez, on the other hand, sees not only a Democratic-leaning Gwinnett County, but a Democratic Georgia by the 2032 presidential election. That\\'s only possible if there\\'s continued investment in reaching out to new communities of voters.\\n\\'We haven\\'t saturated the number of Democratic votes that we can get out of Gwinnett County, and we\\'re not talking about 12,000 votes. We\\'re talking about well over hundreds of 1000s of votes,\" she said. \\'It\\'s a matter of who touches them first, who reaches out first.\"\\nIf Georgia is a battleground swing state, Kannan Udayarajan, chair of the Forsyth County Democratic chapter said he sees Forsyth, north of Atlanta, as \\'the frontline of that battleground.\\'\\nFor much of the 20th Century, Forsyth was a sundown town – not a single Black person lived within the county\\'s 247 square miles. A white mob in 1912 forced out its roughly 1,100 Black residents after three Black men were accused of raping two white women.\\nWhen, in 1987, protesters marched through Forsyth to shed light on its racist underbelly, they were met with jeers and rocks hurled by white supremacists, including members of the Klu Klux Klan. The violence prompted Oprah Winfrey to film an hour-long special in the county, calling it the \\'battlefield of the civil rights movement\\' of that decade.\\nToday, the divisions are less Black and white, and more red and blue.\\nSituated northeast of Gwinnett, Forsyth was the fastest growing county in Georgia and the 15th fastest across the U.S. in 2020, according to the Census Bureau.\\nMuch of that growth has come from an increase in south Asian residents. Between 2010 and 2019, the Asian population in the county quadrupled. Asians now represent 18% of Forsyth\\'s residents, according to the Atlanta Regional Commission.\\nMore population growth is expected soon.\\nThe county government recently approved an 84-acre development project that would include 1,800 multi-family housing units and an 18,500-seat arena as the home of a national hockey team the county is vying for.\\nThe project mimics a development called The Battery, built in Cobb County in 2017, that included a new stadium for the Atlanta Braves baseball team, along with a shopping area and thousands of apartments, condos and townhouses. It\\'s credited with causing an uptick in growth in that county, which also has shifted Democratic over the last several election cycles.\\nUdayarajan believes Forsyth is on a similar political trajectory as Cobb, Gwinnett and other bedroom communities closer to Atlanta. In 2012, Romney won 80% of the vote in the county. Trump received only 66% support in 2020.\\nWithout Forsyth, Udayarajan argues Biden would have lost Georgia. The county, he said, saw more than 16,000 new Democrats vote in that election, roughly 5,000 more than the margin Biden won the state by.\\nUdayarajan isn\\'t the only one who sees the possibility. This year marks the first time a Democratic presidential candidate has opened a local campaign office in Forsyth.\\nA sign of the energy building among Democrats in the area? The local party was expecting 60 people to show up to the office\\'s grand opening. More than 300 people came, including Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear who was once on the shortlist to become Vice President Kamala Harris\\' running mate.\\n\\'There is a certain sense at the top leadership around the importance of the work that needs to be done in Forsyth County,\\' Udayarajan said.\\nNikki Melendez has watched the building momentum – and political tensions – with an outsider\\'s perspective.Melendez, 20, moved to Cumming in 2017 with her family. As a military child, she had previously lived all over the world, including Germany, New Jersey, and a sleepy town in Oklahoma.\\nShe described Forsyth as in a \\'metamorphosis stage.\\'\\nDuring the 2020 election, she said Biden-Harris signs were scattered across lawns on one section of her block, and on the other were Trump signs, and bumper stickers with conspiracy theories.\\n\\'A lot of people who have lived here forever get a little angry when you talk about all the moving,\\' she said.',\n",

The Arizona Cardinals were only 3-for-10 on 3rd down, but came away with the 24-23 win.\\nThe Seahawks were a 7.5-point favorite against the New York Giants and started the 2nd quarter with a 7-0 lead. But the Giants controlled the game from that point on and won 29-20. They converted 7 of 16 attempts on 3rd down and led 23-13 until a late TD by Seahawks WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba. K Jason Myers' 47-yard game-tying field goal attempt was blocked and returned 60 yards for the clinching TD.\\nPlay our free daily Pick'em Challenge and win!

       "   'summary': 'Officials in Florida have issued evacuation orders and dire warnings as Hurricane Milton, a Category 4 storm as of Tuesday morning, approaches making landfall in the state less than two weeks after Hurricane Helene devastated Florida and parts of Georgia, the Carolinas and Tennessee.\\nIn a late Tuesday morning update from the National Hurricane Center, meteorologists expanded the storm surge warning along Florida\\'s Gulf Coast and gave residents one final alert to leave the area, saying \"Today is the last full day for Florida residents to get their families and homes ready and evacuate if told to do so by local officials.\"\\n\"Milton has the potential to be one of the most destructive hurricanes on record for west-central Florida,\" John Cangialosi, a specialist with the National Hurricane Center, said Tuesday.\\nHurricane Milton live updates:Florida braces for monster storm\\nAccording to the NHC, Milton is expected to turn toward the east-northeast and northeast Tuesday and Wednesday before making landfall in Florida Wednesday night. Potentially deadly storm surges of up to 15 feet are also possible for Tampa and other coastal communities, significantly higher than the already hugely destructive 4-8 foot surges experienced during Helene.\\nOfficials have one very important message to hammer home to residents: take evacuation orders seriously.\\nOf Florida\\'s 67 counties, 51 counties are under a state of emergency, according to the Jacksonville Florida Times-Union, part of the USA TODAY network. Zones A, B, C and are subject to mandatory evacuations across several counties.\\nOn Monday evening, Tampa Mayor Jane Castor told CNN in an interview that listening to mandatory orders is crucial for survival.\\n\"I can say without any dramatization whatsoever: If you choose to stay in one of those evacuation areas, you\\'re going to die,\" Castor said. When asked what she would say to those who have ridden out storms in the area in the past, she emphasized that \"there\\'s never been one like this before,\" and said that Milton is shaping up to be \"literally catoptric\" with predicted storm surges that are not survivable.\\n\"I\\'ve never said that (before). A 10 to 12-foot surge....this is something that I have never seen in my life and I can tell you that anyone who was born and raised in the Tampa Bay area has never seen anything like this before,\" she said. \"People need to get out.\"\\nHurricane Milton tracker:Storm weakens slightly to Category 4; still \\'extremely dangerous\\'\\nGov. Ron DeSantis told Florida residents in a press briefing Tuesday that \"time is running out\" to evacuate from areas on Milton\\'s path.\\n\"There\\'s no guarantee what the weather\\'s going to be like starting Wednesday morning,\" DeSantis said. \"You may have a window where it may be safe, but you may not. So use today as your day to finalize and execute the plan that is going to protect you and your family.\"\\nDeSantis signed an executive order eliminating tolls on western Florida roads.\\n\"You have an opportunity today to do what you need to do to execute this plan. You have time today but do it. Time is going to start running out very, very soon,\" he said.\\nIn a press conference held on Tuesday, Biden said Milton \"could be one of the worst storms in 100 years in Florida.\"\\n\"The current path of the storm (is expected to hit) Tampa Bay area and cut directly across the state, east to west, all the way across the state, with the potential for this storm to both enter Florida as a hurricane and leave Florida as a hurricane on the Atlantic coast.\" He said. \"This could be the worst storm to hit Florida in over a century. God willing it won\\'t be, but that\\'s what it\\'s looking like right now.\"\\nBiden also assured any support local leaders ask for \"they will get,\" saying he already has thousands of federal responders on the grounds to deliver resources as fast as possible.\\nOn Sunday, Pinellas Sheriff Bob Gualtieri told citizens and business owners in a press conference that any businesses refusing to heed evacuation orders would be shut down.\\n\"In the past, mandatory evacuation orders have been issued and bars stay open,\" he said. \"Restaurants stay open. And people just go about their business in stores. That\\'s not going to happen this time. We\\'re going to shut you down because we can\\'t have the tragedy that we had a week and a half ago.\"\\n\"This is going to be bad,\" he added. \"Everyone just needs to get out.\"\\nSarasota Mayor Liz Alpert told ABC News that residents should not let past experiences of riding out storms lure them into a false sense of security.\\n\"Even in a highrise, it\\'s still going to be dangerous,\" she said. \"I have stayed because we haven\\'t had anything like this and I have to say I\\'m really concerned.\"\\nShe said she is most concerned about the storm surge predicted to be as high as 10 to 15 feet, saying it will \"cover completely all of our barrier islands and cover houses that are two stories tall. Then these really excessive winds, unheard of kind of wind in a hurricane.\"',\n",

Other versions of the claim were shared on Instagram and X, formerly Twitter.\\nMore from the Fact-Check Team: How we pick and research claims | Email newsletter | Facebook page\\nThe original video shows Harris listening through an earpiece and speaking into a microphone; there\\'s no evidence the video shows Bluetooth earrings. She was wearing different jewelry than what she wore at the debate, but those weren\\'t Bluetooth earrings, either.\\nSome social media users falsely claimed Harris wore earrings that were in-ear transmitters to give her an advantage during her Sept. 10 presidential debate against former President Donald Trump. But those were Tiffany & Co. earrings she had worn to previous events.This post is equally wrong on the nature of her earrings.\\nThe original video was shared by MSNBC anchor Jonathan Capehart on X in 2019 and shows Harris chatting with Capehart about a recipe while wearing an earpiece to prepare for an on-camera interview. She is clearly wearing a microphone on her lapel. The longer, zoomed-out footage shows Harris picking up an electronic control box from the table after speaking into the microphone and listening through the earpiece. Wires run from the controller up Harris\\' chair.\\nThe vice president\\'s earrings in the video are clearly different from the pearl ones she wore during the debate, as well as the Nova audio earrings users falsely claimed she was wearing at the debate.\\nFact check: No those weren\\'t transmitters in Kamala Harris\\' ears during debate\\nUSA TODAY reached out to the user who shared the post for comment but did not immediately receive a response.

       "   'summary': 'Milwaukee\\'s crime continued to decrease during the third quarter of the year, building on other positive trends from earlier in the year.\\nCity leaders delivered the details of the city\\'s third quarter crime stats at a Tuesday press conference, noting that homicides and non-fatal shootings were both down significantly, at 22% and 23% respectively. Those categories are part of a city-wide dip, with what\\'s called Part 1 crime down 4% in total.\\nIn all, Part 1 crimes, as defined by the FBI as homicide, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary and vehicle theft, decreased from 19,994 last year to 19,172 this year.\\n\\'I want crime in this city to be rare,\\' said Mayor Cavalier Johnson during the press conference inside city hall.\\nThe decrease is particularly good news, as the third quarter includes the summer months — a period when violent crime generally rises.\\nTuesday\\'s press conference wasn\\'t filled with just good news, however, as three crime categories have increased.\\nRobberies were up 3%, auto thefts were up 4%, and carjackings were up 17%, bucking the other positive trends. Human trafficking, a rare crime in the city, stayed static at 25 reported instances so far this year, the same number as last year.\\nCarjackings have remained a persistent problem this year, even as reported auto thefts show much lower increases. In July, ahead of the Republican National Convention, Milwaukee Police Chief Jeffrey Norman warned of the crime and several high-profile crimes have involved carjackings.\\n\\'I do not like to see trends like this. While we know summer is hot both in weather and crime trends, we do not take this lightly,\\' Norman said at the press conference.\\nVehicle crashes remained static in Milwaukee year to date, down 1%, and hit-and-run crashes up 1%. However, fatalities were down 10%.\\nJohnson\\'s budget proposal for 2025 includes funding for police trailer cameras, which he hopes will help address reckless driving issues in the city. Those cameras are mobile and can be placed in areas with high levels of reckless driving to record incidents and then be used in subsequent enforcement.\\nIt remains to be seen if the cameras will be in the final budget, as the budget is being deliberated in the Common Council\\'s Finance and Personnel Committee through October. The final budget is scheduled to be adopted on Nov. 8.\\n\\'When we see certain categories flip up,\\' Johnson said. \\'We\\'re determined to find strategies in order to bring those numbers back down.\\'\\nThis year\\'s downturn in homicides is notable in comparison with the COVID-19 period in Milwaukee, when the city experienced three years of record-breaking homicides before a 20% reduction in 2023.\\nThis year, in Milwaukee, there have been 102 homicides through Oct. 2, the period which Tuesday\\'s press conference covered. In the days since the data was pulled, there have been more, including a 16-year-old boy who was shot and killed on Sunday.\\nThis year is a decrease from the city\\'s peak in 2020, when there were 190 reported homicides, and 2021, when there were 196 reported homicides. The following year, the city reached a historic high of 215 in 2022.\\nMilwaukee\\'s record-breaking period of homicides during the COVID-19 pandemic was part of a larger nationwide rise.\\nThis year, homicide is estimated to be down nationwide by almost 18%, according to an analysis of 277 cities from AH Datalytics, a data analysis firm. Milwaukee joins other cities with positive homicide data, like Chicago, with a 7.2% dip and Detroit, which saw a 20.5% dip, according to AH Datalytics analysis.\\nStill, this year\\'s decrease in Milwaukee is a far-cry from the late 2010s, when homicides were at 97 and 99, in 2019 and 2018 respectively, according to police data.\\nAshanti Hamilton, the director of the city\\'s Office of Community Wellness and Safety, said at the press conference that while the quarter stats were an \\'important milestone\", more needed to be done.\\n\\'We remain keenly aware that reducing violence is an ongoing process,\\' he said. \\'We understand that sustainable change requires addressing the root causes of crime and this means looking beyond the immediate crime reduction strategies and focus on broader social, economic and systemic changes.\\'\\nThe department also improved on completing cases, from last quarter, as Milwaukee\\'s homicide clearance rate was at 78% year to date.\\nTo clear a case, an individual must be arrested, charged and turned over for prosecution, according to the FBI\\'s crime reporting standards. Cases can also be cleared by unique circumstances. For example, when a suspect has been identified but cannot be arrested because they cannot be located or have already died.\\nThe clearance rate was at 74% in the second quarter. In the first quarter of the year, it was 83%.',\n",

       "   'summary': \"Editor's Note: The Ideas Lab asked the Democrat and Republican candidates for the U.S. Senate to submit 1,000 word essays on how they would tackle health care, the issue Wisconsinites surveyed as part of the Main Street Agenda project said is the third most significant problem they face heading into the Nov. 5 election.\\nThe Aﬀordable Care Act made numerous promises that it would slow down the increase in health care costs and improve the access to care. Additionally, President Obama said you would be able to keep your family doctor. The reality is health care costs have only spiked more rapidly since its enactment and access to care has declined in every community. The family doctor has sadly all but disappeared. The legislation sounded good in theory and included one worthy provision, which ensures individuals with pre-existing conditions are able to access health care, but everything else has made health care more expensive and worse.\\nTammy Baldwin essay:We beat Big Pharma, but I'm not done fighting for your health care\\nIn both my personal life and professional career, I have been forced to dive into the diﬃculties and complexities of our health care system to find solutions. In 1991, I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis at the age of 27, which completely changed my life. As an entrepreneur, I have started a myriad of businesses, purchasing health insurance for thousands of employees throughout my career.\\nA little over 10 years ago, the continued increase in medical costs began to negatively impact my businesses and my employees. Eventually, I even had to move to self-insure my employees in an eﬀort to keep our health care costs static.\\nIt allowed mass consolidation between health care systems, creating oligarchies and monopolies. As a result, massive health care systems don't need to be eﬃcient and aren't forced to provide a value proposition to patients.\\nI've seen this firsthand in my hometown of Madison. Madison's largest health care provider, UW Health, was allowed to buy the second largest provider, Meriter Health Services. Estimates suggest the combined entity now controls nearly 60% of the market for hospital services in the Madison region. Health care monopolies have led to less eﬃciency, higher costs, and a decrease in access.\\nThis mass consolidation has also led to the rapid decline in the presence of the family doctor. ACA placed so many regulations on the family doctor, and the consolidated health care systems made it harder for the family doctors to remain in the broader insurance pools, which forced many doctors to retire or sell to larger physician practices. Massive health care systems then buy up independent, physician-run practices, further enhancing their pricing power.\\nAnother major flaw in the ACA is the medical loss ratio. The MLR is a de-facto cap on profits that requires health insurers to spend a minimum percentage of their revenue on medical care. While this sounds good in theory, in reality the rule has only fueled medical care costs to rise faster.\\nThe reason is if you're capping what a health insurer can make on a dollar of premium, they no longer have an incentive to push back on medical costs to grow their profits. In fact, the only way a health insurer can grow their profits is by letting medical costs go up.\\nThis also fueled vertical integration with health care providers merging with health insurers and even pharmacy benefit managers, decreasing transparency and increasing costs. Cigna, United Health, and CVS Aetna all either own or are aﬃliated with PBMs, which has allowed them to inflate their medical payments to their aﬃliate, passing on the higher cost to patients. Health premiums have risen 20% faster since the MLR took eﬀect under the ACA than in the five previous years.\\nRising health care costs under the ACA have put individuals and families in a precarious financial situation. In 2010, according to KFF, family coverage cost $13,770. In 2023 family coverage costs rose to $23,968 — an increase of 74% over 13 years. More than 60% of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck, meaning they are just one medical bill away from a financial emergency.\\nSince 1980, the two sectors with the highest rates of inflation in our economy have been health care and higher education. The correlation between these two industries is that the federal government has gotten increasingly involved with an influx of money. More money sounds appealing at first, but in reality it has only allowed these two industries to continually raise prices on consumers. Specifically in health care, from 1980 to 2023, the Medical Care CPI increased by approximately 445%. That is astounding.\\nWhile increasing prices is a major problem, an equally important problem is the decline in access to care.\\nRural communities throughout the country and here in Wisconsin are struggling to provide access to care. Last spring, two hospitals in Eau Claire and Chippewa Falls, along with 19 clinics throughout western Wisconsin, were forced to close due to a multitude of factors including record-high inflation, staﬃng shortages and regulatory complexities.\\nSmaller hospital systems are having a harder time dealing with the mass regulations by the federal government and changes in reimbursement rates. Sen. Baldwin's solution was to make matters worse by requiring even more restrictions and regulations. We must address the root causes of what is forcing these closures and limiting access to care.\\nOur health care system is broken, and it is critical that we elect individuals who have real-life experience in the space to provide solutions. As your senator, I will fight for increased price transparency throughout the health care system, empowering patients and employees to price shop and make informed decisions. I will fight to require health insurers and PBMs to disclose their negotiated drug rebates and discounts, revealing the true cost of prescription drugs. I will fight to support Community Health Centers to bolster access to care for patients in rural and underserved urban areas. And I will fight to address the physician shortage and increase training programs for new doctors.\\nACA sounded good in theory, but in practice has a multitude of flaws. Results matter and Wisconsinites are struggling because of our broken health care system. We need a significant overhaul that puts patients first and prioritizes market based solutions to reduce costs, expand accessibility and increase transparency.\\nEric Hovde is the Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in Wisconsin. He is the CEO of Hovde Properties, a Madison-based real estate development company.\\nQuestion: Last spring, two hospitals (in Eau Claire and Chippewa Falls) and 19 clinics closed in western Wisconsin. The Marshfield Clinic Healthcare System instituted staff furloughs earlier this year. In the Milwaukee area, some providers are reducing services. Health care systems cite staffing difficulties, inadequate Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements, higher costs and declining rates of patients with private insurance. How would you propose to tackle this problem?\",\n",

       "   'summary': 'In April 2021, astronomy educator John Heasley set out to see just how dark the skies were in southwestern Wisconsin\\'s Vernon County.\\nHe measured the brightness of the night sky in three public recreational areas — Wildcat Mountain State Park, the Kickapoo Valley Reserve and Tunnelville Cliffs State Natural Area — and was delighted by what he found.\\nFor years, Heasley and other night sky enthusiasts in the region had dreamed of getting the properties designated as an international dark sky park, a title that signifies excellent stewardship of the night sky and attracts star-seeking visitors interested in astronomy — or just enjoying stars not visible when there is too much light. The measurements he took that spring showed the skies were easily dark enough to qualify for the designation.\\nBut by fall 2023, that had changed. His measurements found that sky brightness had increased by 50% or more in some areas — too bright to qualify.\\n\"It was a blow. It was a disappointment,\" Heasley said. \"We had done so much work to create this international dark sky park.\"\\nMore:Look! Up in the sky! It\\'s...well, not much, really. But you can limit light pollution.\\nHe and others believe the culprit is increased outdoor use of LED lights, which communities around the country are switching to en masse because they last longer and eat up less energy than traditional bulbs. Research is beginning to show that comes with a price: the bluer, brighter light that LEDs emit could be brightening the night sky by as much as 10% each year, one study found. And the impacts extend beyond stargazing. The brightness can disrupt the nighttime patterns of people and animals, which can have health consequences.\\nDark sky park designations come from the International Dark Sky Association, which began a \"dark sky places\" program in 2001. Parks are one of its categories, which range from sanctuaries (remote areas with little to no light encroachment) to urban night sky places (which are in urban areas but take significant steps to still provide an \"authentic nighttime experience\").\\nTo date, the association has certified more than 200 dark sky places, resulting in more than 61,000 square miles of protected night skies in 22 countries. Wisconsin has just one such place: Newport State Park, at the tip of Door County on the shores of Lake Michigan, which has had the designation for seven years.\\nMore:A Driftless Region county is aiming to be a new frontier in protecting Wisconsin\\'s darkest skies\\nThe application process is stringent and can take years. Dark sky parks must have robust educational programs to teach the public about the harms of light pollution. On top of that, getting dark enough skies often requires changing light fixtures. That has happened at Kickapoo Valley Reserve and Wildcat Mountain State Park, which have changed about 60 fixtures. There are no lights at Tunnelville Cliffs.\\nLocal power engineer Scott Lind led the effort, painting the sides of omnidirectional light fixtures so the light would only shine down, and using photographic gels to soften the light coming from recently replaced LED bulbs. Today, Heasley said, \"We\\'ve made all the light changes we can make\" on those properties.\\nThe problem is the land outside them.\\nEven when sky brightness readings met the qualifications to be a dark sky park, light domes from the small surrounding towns and villages were visible from the three properties, Heasley told the Journal Sentinel in 2022. Those communities have been slowly making the transition from high-pressure sodium streetlights and other outdoor lights to brighter LEDs.\\nIt\\'s not that residents haven\\'t been receptive to helping protect their starry skies — in fact, the nearby village of Ontario put lower-temperature LED bulbs in its streetlights when switching over to help keep things dark. (Lower-temperature LEDs, typically around 3000 Kelvin or lower, emit less blue light and give off a warmer glow.)\\nMore:Biggest astronomical events in 2024: Eclipses to meteor showers and full moon schedule\\nStill, it just isn\\'t dark enough anymore.\\nLind pointed to a 2021 study led by National Park Service staff in Chelan County, Washington, which had just switched its streetlights from high-pressure sodium to mostly 3000 Kelvin LEDs. Sky glow increased after the transition, the researchers found, in one place by as much as 60%.\\nSince light pollution can travel more than 100 miles from its source, municipalities from farther away could also be making an impact, Lind added.\\nThe Chelan County study — and the sky measurements in his own area — were a \"wake-up call,\" he said. He hopes to use what happened as a teaching moment \"to show how drastically things are changing, and quickly.\"\\nJust because the dark sky park designation may be out of reach for now doesn\\'t mean Lind and Heasley are giving up.\\nWhile they can\\'t approach places like Ontario and ask them to get new lights again, Lind acknowledged, they can develop relationships with other communities that haven\\'t yet transitioned to LED lights for outdoor fixtures — and when it\\'s time to do so, urge them to consider a lower temperature, such as 2200 Kelvin.\\nBusinesses and municipalities can also dim LED lights or turn them off completely if there are certain times they don\\'t need to be lit, Heasley suggested.\\nMore:Looking for more stars? Here are the five international dark sky places closest to Wisconsin\\nLind and Heasley are also interested in raising broader public awareness of light pollution and the importance of keeping night skies dark. One way they\\'ll tackle that is through the work of a new group, DarkSky Wisconsin, which launched this summer.\\nThough it\\'s in its infancy, chapter president Sam Saeger said the group\\'s ultimate goal is to work with municipalities to write rules that preserve starry skies. What happened in Vernon County shows that protecting them takes everyone, she said.\\nHeasley said he tries to reframe his disappointment by thinking about the work he and others have done to enhance stargazing opportunities at the three properties. People need public places to see the stars and other cosmic phenomena, he said, so they\\'ll \"fall in love with it and help speak up for it.\"\\n\"What I like to say is, starry skies await you in Vernon County along the Kickapoo River,\" Heasley said. \"They\\'re still there.\"',\n",

The law applies to active duty members of the uniformed services who are living away from home, as well as family members who are \"absent due to the member\\'s active duty or service,\" according to the U.S. Department of Justice\\'s website. It also applies to eligible U.S. citizens living abroad.\\nRegistered voters in Georgia can also request to vote by mail by absentee ballot without an excuse, according to the state\\'s website. County registrars were scheduled to begin sending these ballots to voters starting Oct. 7.\\nThe first day of early in-person voting in Georgia is Oct. 15.\\nUSA TODAY has debunked numerous claims related to the 2024 presidential election, including false assertions that one-time supporters of former President Donald Trump in a Harris campaign ad are Democratic actors, that a video shows Trump\\'s college report card and that Harris used a teleprompter during an interview with Oprah Winfrey.\\nUSA TODAY reached out to the Instagram user who shared the post for comment but did not immediately receive a response.\\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

These guys will never, ever quit. \"Murph\" will make sure they don\\'t.\\nThank you, Willy Adames, for your leadership, for that constant smile, for your love of the game. Oh, and all those 3 run homers helped a little, too. Thank you, Christian Yelich, for inspiring us, whether you were able to play or not. Same with \\'Coach\\' Brandon Woodruff. Excited to have you guys back next year.\\nThank you, William Contreras; tough as nails, a great catcher, a great hitter, great leader.\\nWho is the GOAT of basketball?LeBron James deserves NBA crown over Jordan.\\nThank you to the great Brewers infield kids, Brice Turang and Joey Ortiz, spectacular defense, and, with Turang on first after an opposition base hit, he was going to be on second very, very soon with one of those 50 steals.\\nThank you, Rys Hoskins. You set the tone against the Mets opening weekend! I know you didn\\'t hit the way you wanted, but that didn\\'t stop you from being a strong clubhouse presence.\\nHow about that outfield. Blake Perkins can jump over any wall, pulling back any homer in his reach; Sal Frelick would run through any wall to snag that ball; and Jackson Chourio, holy cow, something special at age 20!\\nA brilliant starting pitching staff on the injury list: Woodruff, Wade Miley, Robert Gasser; but, no problem, we\\'ve got Freddie Peralta, Tobias Myers, Colin Rea and now Aaron Civale and Frankie Montas. Devin Williams out for half of the season - no problem! Trevor MeGill for the save! Kudos, Chris Hook, best pitching coach in the game.\\nGarrett Mitchell, Aaron Ashby, and DL Hall finally got healthy, excited to see what they do next year.\\nI have to admit, it was really, really fun to check the standings every day and see the Chicago Cubs, ten or more games behind every single day! Murphy\\'s moves were masterful in this series from pitching to pinch hitting. Chourio and Mitchell going deep in Game 2, the crowd goes wild. How about Bauers, with what looked like a series winner, and next pitch, Frelick matching him. Great, ecstatic moments.\\nThen, heartbreak. Williams, so good, in so many games. The walk to Lindor, a killer. Frelick would\\'ve run through that wall, if he could have, to catch that homer. Those last three outs in an elimination game are really tough to get. I feel for you, Devin Williams.\\nHis daughter\\'s heart stopped.An act of kindness brought him comfort.\\nIt\\'ll take a while to get over, because we love our Brewers, and we love this scrappy team.\\nBut soon, like this team, we will be hungry, and our hope will return. The seeds are there for another great year.\\nI toss my Jonathan Lucroy jersey into the closet, and think, only four-and-a-half months until spring training!',\n",

       "   'excerpt': 'The TikToker with nearly 13 million followers has found herself the subject of controversy as some say she was spreading misinformation about FEMA.',\n",
       "   'summary': 'A social media influencer and beloved creator on TikTok is currently the subject of controversy thanks to rising tensions around the emergency response to hurricanes Helene and Milton.\\nOphelia Nichol, known better by her nickname \"Mama Tot,\" has built a massive following with her messages of kindness and understanding. Known for her motherly and inspirational content, she has made headlines in the past, including when her son was fatally shot and killed before his 19th birthday in 2022.\\nWith a follower count just shy of 13 million, Nichol has been something of a lifeline for her fans, providing words of affirmation, support and at times, donating large sums of money to causes, including most recently Hurricane Helene relief.\\nHowever Nichol has recently become embroiled in a controversy online, receiving backlash from some viewers who have accused her of spreading misinformation in a now-viral video.\\nHere\\'s what to know about the controversy.\\nBoasting 12.8 million followers and over 593.5 million likes on her main TikTok account, @shoelover99, Ophelia Nichol, better known online by her nickname Mama Tot, is as close as it gets to TikTok royalty.\\nReferring lovingly to her fans as her \"Tater Tots,\" Nichol has built her platform on a premise of kindness, gentleness, support, advocacy for the disenfranchised and spreading joy and unconditional love. From \"eat with me videos\" where she sits down to have lunch while sharing inspirational messages to personal responses to fans and other creators going through hard times, Nichol\\'s platform is often summed up as \"incredibly wholesome,\" especially in the oftentimes brutal world of the internet.\\nShe has also championed myriad causes in her time on the app, raising and donating money and expressing support for LGBTQ+ rights, disaster relief, personal fundraisers for medical bills, animal welfare causes and other issues.\\nShe has posted many videos about Hurricane Helene, sharing information about resources and donations and donating $1,100 of her own money to the Cajun Army in one video posted on Oct. 4.\\nIn an Oct. 3 video with over 5.4 million views, Nichol expressed frustration at the experiences of people affected by Hurricane Helene.\\n\"You ain\\'t mad!?\" The just shy of one-minute clip starts. \"Cause I\\'m mad as hell.\" Speaking of the victims of the disaster, Nichol said, \"They have lost everything. Everything. Imagine walking outside of your house and seeing nothing that you ever worked hard for, just gone.\"\\nAfter sharing some of the sad news she had seen online about the storm, Nichol spoke in vague terms about issues some may have in receiving aid, the part of the video that appears to have caused the bulk of the controversy.\\n\"How are they supposed to apply for stuff, then, if they don\\'t have electricity? That does not get their babies fed in this moment, like. The job they had, the building is gone. Like, how is nobody mad?\" she said.\\nThe comments beneath the video have since been turned off and the post was briefly made private or deleted before being reinstated. However, posts to TikTok and other platforms like X, formerly Twitter, began appearing soon after, saying the creator was disseminating misinformation about FEMA resources to her 13 million followers.\\nNichol did not immediately respond to request for comment.\\nSome fans also expressed disappointment that the video made them feel she may be a Trump supporter. She has since posted a video, saying \"I never thought that I would ever have to say that I didn\\'t vote for Trump. I thought people just knew that by my actions.\"\\nPlenty of other creators and viewers defended her, however. Though it appears she has lost an estimated 100,000 followers, Nichol\\'s large and dedicated fan base also came out in huge waves, expressing support and creating video responses to her accusers.\\nMany of her supporters made the point not only that Nichol never explicitly said anything about FEMA or politics in her post, but that she has historically put money where her mouth is by donating to and supporting causes, including disaster relief.\\nIn a response posted Oct. 6, Nichol addressed the backlash that had been rapidly growing online. Specifically, she made the point that she felt people had run with wild assumptions based on a clip that did not explicitly express any such political messaging.\\'I have been on this app since 2020, and I\\'ve loved on people the entire time,\\' she said in the 6-minute video. \\'And not one time have I ever used my platform for politics, for any of that stuff. Cause, for one, people don\\'t know how to talk to one another when it comes to politics. They just don\\'t. They hate you if you don\\'t agree.\"\\nShe explained that the video was a moment of her expressing sadness over the tragedy and what people of the Carolinas, Georgia, Tennessee and Florida are experiencing. Never, she said, did comments about the government\\'s response come into play.\\n\"In that video, I never said anything about politics, FEMA, money, the government, presidents, never said anything about those things,\" she said. \"None of that. I just expressed just how frustrating and sad and angry I was that they gotta go through this.\"\\nIn another video posted Monday, she spoke with more clarity on the subject, saying that she did not realize when posting the original clip that it could be taken in a negative way and saying she was frustrated to see people lying about what she did say.\\nShe also said that it\\'s possible people were saying such things in the comment section and her detractors erroneously intertwined her message with said comments. She likewise wondered if people were lumping her in with other creators she is not associated with who were spreading such messages.\\n\"I haven\\'t said those things at all. And people have accused me of everything,\" she said.\\nShe has since continued posting her normal content about lifestyle, food, shopping and positive affirmations to her audience. She has also posted several more videos about different forms of relief people looking to help Helene victims can provide through donations or volunteering.\\nRumors and misinformation about federal support around hurricane relief have proliferated on social media and beyond since Helene hit, with some of the false claims being spread by former president Donald Trump.\\nFEMA has since launched an entire webpage addressing these rumors, which include allegations that there are \\'no helicopters, no rescue\\' in North Carolina and that the federal government is only giving $750 to those who have lost their homes.\\nFEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell pushed back Trump\\'s claims about Hurricane Helene recovery efforts, saying she was disappointed in the misinformation he was spreading.',\n",

Milton is then expected to move east-northeastward across central Florida through Thursday, the National Hurricane Center shared with USA TODAY.\\nMillions across the region are scrambling to wrap up storm preparations or evacuate from vulnerable areas as Hurricane Milton makes its way from the Gulf of Mexico towards Florida Peninsula. And Waffle House, a restaurant chain known for being open and serving up breakfast 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, is no exception.\\nWaffle House on Tuesday afternoon announced the closures across Florida, imploring residents to stay safe and follow local guidelines since the information is subject to change with little notice due to the potential variations in Milton\\'s path.\\nWaffle House spokesperson Njeri Boss confirmed the Florida restaurant closures with USA TODAY on Tuesday evening.\\n\"As we stated during Hurricane Helene, our mission remains to keep our Associates out of harm\\'s way. Accordingly, in areas predicted to be hardest hit, we will preemptively close restaurants with a goal of reopening them as soon as it is safe to do so to serve the communities that have there for us over the years.\"\\nPreemptive closures were issued, as a safety precaution, for locations in areas predicted to be \"in the path of Hurricane Milton and likely to suffer significant damage, or where mandatory evacuations have been ordered,\" according to Waffle House.\\nWaffle House employees will also be following local evacuation procedures.\\nAbout 33 Waffle House locations are currently closed and 22 remain open across the state, according to the Waffle House Index posted to X. Waffle House has more than 1,900 locations in 25 states, and most are in the Midwest, according to the company\\'s website.\\nThe Waffle House Index, created by former Florida county emergency manager Craig Fugate, is a way for emergency responders and officials know where to deploy first responders and supplies based on where Waffle House restaurants are ranked and marked.\\nAll Waffle House restaurants are ranked and marked with one of three different colors — green, red, or yellow to signify conditions.\\nIf first responders reach an area and see an open Waffle House marked green, they know the area is safe and they can keep going to find others who need help. Yellow restaurants signify a limited menu and human service agencies were sent to help. If first responders found a Waffle House marked red, help was desperately needed.\\nFugate was quoted as saying \"If you get there and the Waffle House is closed, that\\'s really bad. That\\'s where you go to work.\"\\nIllustrations include an array of forecast tools and models, and not all are created equal. The hurricane center uses only the top four or five highest-performing models to help make its forecasts.\\nContributing: Saleen Martin',\n",

Prosecutors allege he retrieved his mother\\'s gun from a lockbox, using his mother\\'s key, and shot her in November 2022.\\nThe child was 10 at the time. He\\'s charged with first-degree intentional homicide.\\nWisconsin law allows for children as young as 10 to be charged as adults for certain serious crimes, at least to start the case. Those crimes include first-degree intentional homicide, first-degree reckless homicide and attempted first-degree intentional homicide.\\nLesser charges, such as attempted first-degree reckless homicide or attempted second-degree intentional homicide, start in juvenile court.\\nProsecutors have for months argued the seriousness of the crime warranted adjudicating the matter in adult court. The child\\'s lawyers have pushed for the case to be handled within the juvenile justice system, where he would be better positioned to receive more specialized treatment and age-appropriate services.\\nAt a reverse waiver hearing Tuesday, the child could be seen doodling or drawing on a piece of paper, while seated at the defense table between his lawyers Angela Cunningham and Tanner Kilander.\\nCunningham argued on Tuesday that the Wisconsin statute is unconstitutional, disproportionately affects Blacks and lays the foundation for mass incarceration.\\nMeting out the case in the adult system would deprive the boy of access to services he might need to prepare him for life after his eventual release, Cunningham said. That would potentially leave him at \"a huge disadvantage\" for recidivism and being victimized, she said.\\n\"(The boy) is accused of doing something when he was 10 years old,\" Cunningham said. \"Children at that age are more immature and impulsive ... and can\\'t appreciate the seriousness of an offense of this nature.\"\\nAssistant District Attorney Gil Urfer noted the act for which the child is accused demonstrated some level of intention and planning. Transferring the case to juvenile court, where the case could be disposed of anywhere from a year to when the child turns 25, would \"depreciate the seriousness of the offense.\"\\n\"The way it was perpetrated ... requires that the response be, to some extent, public,\" Urfer said. \"The public needs to know ... when you take action like this, under these circumstances, there\\'s a response from the justice system.\"',\n",

       "   'excerpt': 'Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Rep. Madeleine Dean, D-Pa., have asked Pepsi, Coke, General Mills for details about prices on shrinking products.',\n",
       "   'summary': 'Two members of Congress are calling out Coca-Cola, PepsiCo and General Mills over shrinkflation – reducing the size of their products, but not the prices – and price-gouging consumers while avoiding corporate taxes.\\nIn letters dated Oct. 6 and sent to the CEOs of those three companies, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., and Rep. Madeleine Dean, D-Pa., wrote they were concerned about the \"pattern of profiteering off consumers, both through \\'shrinkflation,\\' and dodging taxes on those price-gouging profits.\"\\nThe congresswomen cited several examples including PepsiCo\\'s replacement of 32-ounce Gatorade bottles with 28-ounce bottles, but charging the same price, essentially \"a 14% price increase,\" they wrote. General Mills reduced some Family Size cereals from 19.3 ounces to 18.1 ounces, while charging the same price, then raising prices five times from mid-2021-mid-2022, they charged. Coca-Cola, they said, used \"package innovation\" to sell \"less soda for the same price.\"\\nSpirit Christmas stores?:One could be opening near you as Spirit Halloween plans to expand with 10 Christmas locations.\\nAs the companies used shrinkflation tactics from 2018 to 2022, each had billions in profits, Warren and Dean charged, but paid average effective tax rates of 15% or less – lower than the corporate tax rate of 21%, set by the 2017 tax cuts, passed during President Trump\\'s term in office.\\nAs each company \"continues to profit off consumers,\" the congresswomen wrote, each \"is also turning around and paying less of those profits in taxes than the families it price gouges.\"\\nThe companies did not respond to request for comment from USA TODAY.\\nShrinkflation, reducing the size of a product\\'s packaging but keeping the price the same, is not a new concept. Recent Labor Department data found shrinkflation is more common now than during the COVID-19 pandemic years. However, it was also common prior to the pandemic, the data shows.\\nBut the issue has become a hot one as consumers have become highly price-sensitive over the past year. That\\'s led companies to be more likely to reduce the size or volume of a product rather than hike the price.\\nIt\\'s become a campaign issue for Vice President Kamala Harris who has called for a federal ban on price-gouging. That follows President Joe Biden\\'s criticism of food producers for \"shrinkflation\" during a Super Bowl ad and in his State of the Union address in March 2024. He urged the passage of the Shrinkflation Prevention Act of 2024 a bill from Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa.\\nThe two congresswomen asked each company for pricing information of products (by ounces) over the past seven years, along with what the companies\\' federal tax would have been had the 2017 tax reform act not passed. They also asked whether executives got bonuses or other incentives during periods of high inflation.\\nCorporate practices – shrinkflation and low effective tax rates – can \"have the effect of squeezing consumers two times over,\" they wrote.\\nIn the letters, Warren and Dean cite the report \\'Corporate Tax Avoidance in the First Five Years of the Trump Tax Law,\\' from the left-leaning Institute of Taxation and Economic Policy, which found 342 large corporations had paid a cumulative effective tax rate of 14.1% over five years.\\nContributing: Paul Davidson, Rachel Looker and Rebecca Morin.\\nFollow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider & mikegsnider.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'WASHINGTON — Vice President Kamala Harris declined on Tuesday to distance herself from President Joe Biden\\'s record during an appearance on \"The View\" − and she hit back at former President Donald Trump\\'s claims about the White House\\'s handling of the southern border and hurricane relief.\\nIt was one of several interviews that Harris, the Democratic nominee for president, is sitting for this week as her campaign tries to reach less-politically engaged voters with the election less than a month out and early voting beginning in some states.\\nHarris has repeatedly opted for platforms such as the popular podcast \"Call Her Daddy,\" instead of political news shows. She also sat down with radio show host Howard Stern and will appear on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" during a media blitz in New York.\\nIn her first of three appearances on Tuesday, Harris was asked on \"The View\" whether she would have done something differently than Biden over the past four years.\\n\"There is not a thing that comes to mind,\" Harris said, noting that she has been \"a part of most of the decisions that have had impact\" in the Biden administration.\\nShe pointed to legislation that capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors, as well as other efforts to lower prescription drug prices.\\n\"Those were all a shared priority,\" she told the talk show. Harris has said she would seek to expand the health care benefits to all Americans, regardless of age.\\nHammering her Republican opponent, she accused him of being the reason that bipartisan immigration reform legislation had not passed in Congress, an allegation she\\'s frequently raised. \"Donald Trump prefers to run on problems, instead of fixing problems. He is not solution oriented,\" she said.\\nA bipartisan group of senators spent months last year crafting a border bill, but it quickly lost steam on Capitol Hill after Trump publicly opposed the push.\\nHarris also hit Trump for unsubstantiated claims that the Biden administration is intentionally withholding disaster aid from Republican areas and diverting relief funds to housing for undocumented immigrants. It\\'s a charge that the FEMA administrator has refuted as \\'frankly ridiculous and just plain false\\' while back-to-back hurricanes have lashed over the Southeast.\\n\\'It\\'s profound, and it is the height of irresponsibility and, frankly, callousness,\\' Harris said on \\'The View\\' in response to a question about Trump\\'s comments. \\'Lives are literally at stake right now.\\'\\n\\'People are losing their homes with no hope of ever being able to reconstruct or return,\" Harris said as she discussed trips she made to storm-ravaged areas in Georgia and North Carolina.\\n\"The idea that somebody would be playing political games for the sake of himself, but this is so consistent about Donald Trump, he puts himself before the needs of others,\" she added.\\nIn the appearance, Harris urged Floridians in the path of Hurricane Milton to listen to their local officials. Harris said there may be a tendency by Florida residents who have weathered previous events to write the hurricane off. \"This one is going to be different,\" she warned.\\nThe vice president said the severity of the storm is the reason why she has been trying to reach Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. Her comments were the latest volley in a dispute with Florida\\'s top official over the storm response.\\n\"We have to have an agreement that at some point, we all need to work together to combine resources, especially federal, state and local resources, around these kinds of disasters. And I think it\\'s a shame that that hasn\\'t happened,\" she said.\\nDeSantis in a Monday evening interview on Fox News\\' \"Hannity\" said Harris had never called him until Hurricane Helene hit. He said he\\'d been in touch with Biden and FEMA about coordinating resources.\\n\"She has no role in this. In fact, she\\'s been vice president for three and a half years. I\\'ve dealt with a number of storms under this administration. She has never contributed anything to any of these efforts,\" he said.\\nEarlier in the day, Harris had told reporters, in response to a question about a report that DeSantis was ducking her calls, that \"playing politics\" during an emergency \"is just utterly irresponsible, and it is selfish, and it is about political gamesmanship, instead of doing the job that you took an oath to do, which is to put the people first.\"\\nLater Tuesday, during Harris\\' appearance on \"The Howard Stern Show,\" the radio host asked her about a revelation in a new book by journalist Bob Woodward, who reported that Trump secretly sent COVID test kits to Russian President Vladimir Putin for his own personal use.\\nHarris called it \"the most recent stark example of who Donald Trump is,\" that he would secretly send kits to Putin, \"an adversary to the United States,\" at a time when they were in short supply.\\n\"People were dying by the hundreds, everybody was scrambling to get these kits,\" she said. \"... And this guy, who is president of the United States, is sending them to Russia to murderous dictator for his personal use.\"\\nTrump\\'s campaign immediately denied the reporting. Spokesperson Steven Cheung rejected Woodward\\'s reporting in a statement, calling it \"made up stories\" from a \"truly demented and deranged man.\"\\nDeSantis and Trump weren\\'t the only Republicans Harris talked about on Tuesday. Asked whether she would appoint former Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., to her Cabinet, Harris dodged by pointing out that she has to win the election first.\\nBut she described Cheney, a Trump critic who has endorsed Harris for president, as \"remarkable\" person who put her country before her party.\\nOn a lighter note, Harris also described working at McDonald\\'s when she was a college student during the interview. \"It\\'s an experience,\" she said. \"I was doing the fries, and you got to watch the timer, and it\\'s hard work.\"\\nBut Harris said she recognized that, as a college student, her McDonald\\'s pay was spending money. For others working there, it was the source of their family income.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'Editor\\'s note: At the time of the publication of this column, the Jabaliya refugee camp was under Israeli bombardment, NBC News reported. It\\'s the 10th time people in this camp have been displaced since this war began.\\nTwice a day, in the early morning and late afternoon, my four children and I go up to the roof of our dilapidated home in northern Gaza to work on our small urban garden. I ask them to feel the soil between their fingers as they push in the precious seeds I sourced, to water the sprouting vegetables tenderly, and to be thankful and proud as they harvest their purslane, squash and arugula.\\nA few months ago, growing my own vegetables seemed unthinkable. In fact, it\\'s a miracle I\\'m still alive and my house is standing at all. Located just west of the Jabaliya refugee camp, it was seriously damaged in an Israeli airstrike on the adjacent house. But I was determined not to leave. Instead, I spent six weeks clearing out the rubble, boarding up the windows and doors, and covering gaping holes left by Israeli artillery fire with nylon tarps. After being displaced nine times (narrowly escaping death), my family and I returned home in June.\\nThe rooftop garden was born of necessity and an inherent urge to solve problems. Back in February, my youngest daughter, 4-year-old Lilia, woke up crying in the middle of the night with hunger pangs. Israel had been blocking food and other humanitarian aid from entering the Gaza Strip, especially to the north, and large-scale starvation was looming.\\nAll she had eaten that day was a bare soup made from wild mallow.\\nI fed her stale pieces of bread my wife had baked from animal feed and our daughter quickly fell asleep. I, on the other hand, laid awake in bed for hours, agonizing over my children going to sleep hungry.\\nI decided that, no matter how much effort it took, I would find seeds, soil, even chickens if I could, and start a garden so my kids would not have to eat animal feed to stave off hunger.\\nOpinion: Israel has killed more than 41,000 people in Gaza. Biden can end this massacre.\\nMy older kids love to photograph the beauty of the garden and delight in finding a vegetable hidden between the leaves, while Lilia enjoys the fruits of their labor. Though our building is elevated and offers expansive views of Gaza, we are determined not to notice the absolute devastation visible in every direction, just as we try our best to block out the incessant and invasive buzzing of Israeli drones and fighter jets, ducking back inside quickly when the planes circle directly overhead.\\nThis is not the first time that I\\'ve had to find a way out of horrifying circumstances. I have endured decades of Israeli military occupation, an 18-year-long siege and multiple violent Israeli assaults. As an industrial engineer and inventor, I live by the idiom, \\'Necessity is the mother of invention.\\'\\nOpinion alerts: Get columns from your favorite columnists + expert analysis on top issues, delivered straight to your device through the USA TODAY app. Don\\'t have the app?

With my self-made printers, I made tourniquets to help save Palestinian youth who were shot by Israeli soldiers during the \"Great March of Return\" protests and printed protective masks shielding against burns during Israel\\'s bombardment of Gaza in the spring of 2021.\\nMy workshop was destroyed in an Israeli bombing later that same year. In seconds, my childhood dreams, everything I had worked for over 15 long years, were destroyed.\\nBut I would not let despair overwhelm me.\\nIsrael may have destroyed all of my inventions, all the equipment and machinery I had made by hand, but they could not destroy my resolve; I was determined to rebuild.\\nFor the next several months, I poured every ounce of my energy into remaking everything that had taken me years to build. I even received a substantial sum of money for some work I did to help me pay off my debt and expand my workshop. The future was looking bright and I was feeling optimistic.\\nOpinion: \\'Will Palestine still exist when this war is over?\\' My answers to my children\\'s questions.\\nBut optimism is usually short-lived in Gaza.\\nThe attacks on the Gaza Strip that began a year ago have been relentless. Not only did Israel obliterate my workshop once again but they destroyed much of Gaza\\'s industrial infrastructure in a systematic effort to dismantle the productive sector, wiping out many, if not all, of the factories.\\nRebuilding after the 2021 assault was excruciating. Rebuilding now is an exercise in the impossible.\\nThe international community, especially the Biden administration, has yet to put any meaningful pressure on Israel to stop the attacks that are killing and maiming tens of thousands of civilians.\\nI am about to celebrate a second birthday amid what\\'s being investigated as a genocide. I\\'ve lost more than 60 pounds as a result of chronic malnutrition and developed painful gout in my feet. I barely sleep. And yet, each morning I tell myself to live life to the fullest, to treat the day like it\\'s the last day of the assault. I push myself to accomplish something that will make the next day just a little bit better.\\nPlanting and harvesting vegetables with my children is not only about nutrition or mental health in the midst of trauma. Innovation, whether in the form of building a 3D printer out of scrap metal or creating a place of beauty in the center of devastation, is vital so that my children and my people will not only survive, but will also have a chance to thrive and to live meaningful lives with the freedom that we so desperately need and deserve.\\nMohammad Abu Matar is an industrial engineer, inventor and father of four in northern Gaza.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'Wisconsin Republican Senate candidate Eric Hovde on Tuesday called for sweeping cuts to the federal budget and suggested raising the eligibility age for Social Security for people under 40 years old.\\nSpeaking at a luncheon co-sponsored by the Milwaukee Press Club and Rotary Club of Milwaukee, Hovde proposed pulling back federal spending to pre-pandemic levels as he claimed his opponent, Sen. Tammy Baldwin, was avoiding the press.\\n\\'This is what a campaign should be about, right here,\\' Hovde told the crowd. \\'Candidates standing up in front of you, in front of reporters, taking their questions, addressing the issues that matter to the people of this state… Unfortunately, my campaign against Sen. Baldwin hasn\\'t been this way.\\'\\nHe noted Baldwin has agreed to just one debate, scheduled for Oct. 18, and had yet to agree to participate in a similar event as Tuesday\\'s with the Rotary Club.\\nBaldwin\\'s campaign, meanwhile, told the Journal Sentinel the Madison Democrat scheduled 10 open press events in 10 counties this week. Baldwin also took questions from reporters over the weekend. A spokesman said the campaign is \\'working on scheduling\\' an appearance with the Rotary Club.\\nHovde\\'s comments came as he\\'s made up ground on Baldwin in recent weeks. While statewide surveys have consistently shown Baldwin leading Hovde, a recent internal poll from the Madison Democrat\\'s campaign showed her with just a 2-point edge. A deluge of Republican spending in Wisconsin in the final weeks of the race has also raised alarms for Democrats.\\nThe Cook Political Report, an election handicapper, shifted the race this week from \\'lean Democrat\\' to a \\'toss-up.\\'\\nOn Tuesday, Hovde weighed in on a range of topics, from his major campaign issues like the national debt and immigration to climate change, in vitro fertilization and accepting the results of the November election.\\nHovde cited government spending as rising 40% since before the pandemic and said he would like to \\'pull those levels right back again\\' to 2019 levels, before the coronavirus pandemic ravaged the economy.\\nHe did not detail where he would like to see those cuts, including whether they would include defense spending, rather saying the U.S. has to create \\'pro-growth policies,\\' citing deregulation efforts and welfare reform.\\nHovde rejected Democratic claims that he would seek to cut Social Security benefits. He said he does not \\'want to take older people\\'s Social Security away,\\' but he did propose raising the age to receive benefits for people under the age of 40.\\n\\'Because the reality of it is life expectancy is going to increase significantly,\\' he said.\\nWisconsin Democrats on Tuesday said Hovde\\'s proposal to scale back government spending to 2019 levels would \\'mean huge cuts to Medicare, Social Security, veterans\\' benefits, and Medicaid, which helps pay for nursing home care for Wisconsin seniors.\\'\\n\\'The Hovde Plan is clear: Hovde wants to cut benefits for seniors, roll back benefits for our veterans, and let insurance companies jack up drug prices on working Wisconsinites,\\' Democrats wrote in a statement after the luncheon.\\nAsked about former President Donald Trump\\'s plans for mass deportations of illegal immigrants, Hovde did not explicitly comment on the idea but said: \\'You start with anybody who has been convicted of a criminal act, either in this country or in their former country, and you move down from there.\\'\\nHe reiterated his support for in vitro fertilization, suggesting he and his wife \\'tried it,\\' but he declined to endorse comments from Trump suggesting that the government or insurance companies should pay for the service.\\nOn climate change, Hovde said he thinks \\'man is influencing climate\\' and said he believes in \\'good, clean energy propositions that are economical,\\' noting he changed his past position opposing solar energy, as the Journal Sentinel documented earlier this year. But he pushed back on electric vehicle initiatives.\\nHe also doubled down on debunked claims that FEMA is lacking money to respond to natural disasters due to spending to \\'assist illegal immigrants.\\'\\nAsked if he would vote to certify the results of the election in November, Hovde responded: \\'We have to stop every time one side loses an election, saying the election was stolen.\\'\\nHe attacked Democrats who raised questions about past elections and acknowledged Trump has disputed the 2020 results.\\nStill, he cast doubts on the security of ballot drop boxes in Wisconsin, saying: \\'I don\\'t think that was a very constructive thing because all it does is tell 50% of Americans, \\'Oh, they\\'re going to try to do something.\\'\\'\\n\\'If I lose, I lose. OK?\\' Hovde said when asked about accepting election results. \\'Now, if somebody said hey, here\\'s mass fraud, then of course I\\'m going to respond. So I\\'m not going to make a blanket statement because if some evidence is overwhelming…\\'\\nThroughout the luncheon, Hovde repeatedly said the country needs to \\'lower the rhetoric\\' when it comes to politics.\\nHe said he could see himself working across the aisle in the Senate with senators like Mark Warner of Virginia and John Hickenlooper of Colorado.\\n\\'I\\'m going to go sit down with Bernie Sanders because there are areas that we may agree on,\\' he added.\\nStill, Hovde accused Baldwin of avoiding the press and later told reporters he thinks Baldwin has \\'no record to run on.\\'\\n\"I don\\'t think she can stand up and answer the tough questions, but you\\'d have to ask her,\\' he said.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'Milwaukee Brewers television broadcasts will be produced and distributed by Major League Baseball next season, signaling the end of the relationship with Diamond Sports Group, the outfit that has been airing games on Bally Sports Wisconsin.\\nMLB indicated in a release that it will operate the broadcasts for the Cleveland Guardians and Minnesota Twins next year, as well. That doubles MLB\\'s current portfolio of teams for which it handles broadcasts, joining San Diego, Colorado and Arizona. The Texas Rangers have also left Diamond Sports Group, with the future home of their broadcasts to be announced.\\n\"With the media landscape continuing to evolve, Major League Baseball is committed to serving our fans by ensuring they can see their favorite Clubs, removing blackouts where we can, and ultimately growing the reach of our game,\" said MLB deputy commissioner Noah Garden in a release. \"We are proud to bring Guardians, Brewers and Twins games to their passionate fan bases with the same high-quality production that we have demonstrated in Arizona, Colorado and San Diego.\"\\nThe Brewers had the option to return to Diamond following the end of its contract in 2024, but Diamond has been enmeshed in bankruptcy proceedings, and MLB has long sought to reclaim streaming rights from each team as a means of offering games free of blackouts in market on MLB\\'s own app.\\nIt\\'s all part of the crumbling regional sports network (RSN) model, and Diamond\\'s bankruptcy has cultivated uncertainty around broadcasts for a number of MLB, NBA and NHL teams.\\nMore:\\'I embrace the expectations\\': Mark Attanasio talks playoffs, Chourio, Adames and more\\nHere\\'s what all this means for you.\\nThe broadcasts likely won\\'t look or sound all that different, although the look of on-screen graphics might change.\\nThe announcers would largely be the same (most are team employees, anyway), and it\\'s likely MLB will negotiate with carriers to get the games on satellite and cable airwaves. The channel might change, and the games might be available in other places (the Padres games are on Fubo, for example, but also cable and satellite), but Brewers fans won\\'t be short of ways to watch.\\nMLB\\'s release boasted of some innovations Brewers fans might find novel, including ump cameras, live look-ins with the MLB Replay Operations Center and increased access to in-game interviews. It\\'s unclear if the broadcasts will feature a pregame and postgame show that resembles what Brewers fans are used to on Bally Sports broadcasts.\\nFans will still be paying roughly the same, but MLB\\'s native technology is likely to have fewer glitches than what fans often complained about with Bally\\'s app. Aside from a likely switch in channel, cable and satellite customers should also see no difference.\\nPadres games, for example, can be found on the MLB.TV app for those in San Diego. Fans can pay $99 for the year to just get Padres games (called the Padres.TV option), but fans who purchase the full package for $200 are also able to view Padres games in-market in addition to all the other games across baseball that are out-of-market.\\nYes, it\\'s possible, but the degree to which this becomes a problem hinges on the solutions to distribute games. Milwaukee won\\'t be alone across MLB in facing this challenge, though logically it stands to reason that MLB\\'s broadcasting model will yield smaller rights fees than what Diamond was paying.\\nBaseball already has a revenue-sharing policy and does distribute money to clubs through lucrative national contracts that offers packages of games to places like ESPN or Apple TV+. Those deals reportedly helped MLB secure record gross revenues in 2022.\\nThe Brewers, for what it\\'s worth, have already decreased payroll in both the 2023 and 2024 seasons from the year before and, oddly enough, won more games each season compared to the year before.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'The New York Jets\\' firing of Robert Saleh as their head coach five games into the 2024 season sent shockwaves through the NFL on Tuesday.\\nSaleh\\'s dismissal comes at the start of a season in which there were heightened expectations with former Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers back from an injury that kept him out all but the first four plays last year.\\nAlong with Rodgers, Jets offensive coordinator Nathaniel Hackett, who was in Green Bay for three years from 2019-21 and developed a close relationship with the quarterback, was also back leading a New York offense that ranked among the worst last season.\\nBut after back-to-back losses to drop the Jets\\' record to 2-3 and the offense once again struggling, Jets owner Woody Johnson fired Saleh because the team is \"not where we should be given our expectations.\"\\nWithout Rodgers in 2023, the Jets had the fourth-worst scoring offense and second-worst total offense. Five games into the 2024 season, the Jets are certainly not lighting up the scoreboard with their 40-year-old future Hall of Fame quarterback and Hackett running the offense. The Jets are ranked 27th in scoring offense and total offense.\\nWhile Saleh, who was 20-36 in his three-plus seasons as head coach, was hired in 2021 with a defensive background, he\\'s ultimately in charge of all facets of the team.\\nEven so, some of NFL Twitter believe there should be more accountability with Hackett, who has been retained. The Jets brought him to New York a month after he was fired by the Denver Broncos as head coach in 2023 to pave the way for the acquisition of Rodgers from Green Bay. Hackett had lasted just 15 games in Denver, who had the NFL\\'s worst-scoring offense at 16.9 points per game in 2022.\\nSocial media had some thoughts on the Jets\\' situation involving Saleh, Hackett and Rodgers.\\nGiven the Green Bay connections to the Jets, Packers Twitter reacted to Saleh\\'s firing. While Saleh didn\\'t succeed, some note that this shows the type of job Packers head coach Matt LaFleur did during Rodgers\\' later years.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'News broke Tuesday that Robert Saleh had been fired as New York Jets head coach, a notable development for a team that employs former Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers. The Jets are 2-3, coming off a narrow loss to the Minnesota Vikings in England, and the franchise invested a significant volume of capital (the real kind and the draft kind) to land Rodgers in a trade last year. Naturally, the assumption will be that Rodgers was consulted on the decision to fire Saleh.\\nRodgers, of course, is in his second year with the franchise but missed the vast majority of the 2023 season with an Achilles injury, and the Jets finished 7-10 in Rodgers absence. But this is the first time Packers fans have had a chance to see Rodgers playing whole games wearing another jersey.\\nSo how has Rodgers done thus far?\\nRodgers has played in all five games but has completed just 111 of 182 passes, a mark of 61% that would represent his lowest mark since the 2015 season.\\nHis four interceptions are also uncommon, although three came in one game against the Vikings. Remember, Rodgers had just two interceptions in the entire 2018 season, four in 2019, five in 2020 and four in 2021.\\nRodgers has racked up 1,093 yards and seven touchdowns. His 3.8% touchdown percentage would also mark the lowest of his career as a starter.\\nHis quarterback rating of 81.6 is lower by a significant margin compared to any other season in which he played at least five games. His average net yards per attempt, typically a measure that reflects the best quarterbacks in the league, has fallen to 4.90, also the lowest mark as a starter. Even in his ill-fated 2022 season, the final year in Green Bay, that mark was 5.95.\\nRodgers ranks 14th in yards per game among quarterbacks with at least three games played. His rating ranks him 25th, and his completion percentage ranks 24th.\\nThe Vikings intercepted Rodgers three times on Sunday, marking the sixth time he\\'s thrown three picks in a game. The most recent example happened at Detroit on Thanksgiving in his final year with the Packers, but before that you had to go back to 2017, when Rodgers was trying to fight his way back from a broken collarbone and threw three picks in a loss to Carolina.\\nRodgers\\' other three instances of three-interception games came in 2008 (twice) and 2009, his first two years as a full-time starter.\\nThe picks included former University of Wisconsin player Andrew Van Ginkel\\'s return for a pick-six. Another effectively ended the game, when Stephon Gilmore intercepted Rodgers inside the Vikings 10-yard line with less than a minute to play, sealing a 23-17 Vikings win.\\nRodgers did not make his usual appearance on the Pat McAfee Show on Tuesday, but McAfee tweeted that Rodgers will be on the program Wednesday at 11:10 a.m. CT.\\nFollowing a Week 4 loss to Denver, Saleh indicated that his team took a step backward in \"cadence,\" leading to a number of penalties, but Rodgers pretty strongly disagreed with the sentiment. Saleh walked back his comments in the following days.\\n\"That\\'s one way to do it,\" Rodgers said. \"The other way is to hold them accountable. We haven\\'t had an issue. … It\\'s been a weapon. We use it every day in practice. We rarely have a false start, and to have five today, it seemed like, four or five, it seems like an outlier. I don\\'t know if we need to make mass changes based on kind of an outlier game.\"\\nRodgers and Saleh both brushed off any talk of discord despite a strange moment caught on the game broadcast when the Patriots and Jets met in a Thursday Night Football clash, when Rodgers seemed to bristle and push away from a Saleh hug following a touchdown.\\nThe Packers moved up two spots in the first round of the 2023 draft, from No. 15 to No. 13, and drafted Lukas Van Ness with that selection. The Jets, meanwhile, selected Waukesha North alumnus Will McDonald out of Iowa State at 15.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'Municipalities in Washington County may have increased access to video surveillance for drop boxes for absentee voting.\\nOn Wednesday, Oct. 9, the Washington County Board of Supervisors will vote on transferring $3,000 from the budget\\'s general fund to the clerk\\'s budget to provide security surveillance for its absentee ballot drop boxes. If approved, each municipality in the county can decide if they want to use these funds. County Clerk Ashley Reichart said that if a municipality already has this video surveillance, it can get reimbursed for some of its costs.\\nThe County Board of Supervisors meeting is at 6 p.m., room 1019 at the Herbert J. Tennies Government Center.\\nAccording to Reichert, the $3,000 is the estimate if all 21 municipalities in Washington County took advantage of getting surveillance cameras. She said that this cost will not cost the taxpayers any additional money because it would be a transfer of funds from one account to another.\\nAccording to county documents, this will \"further enhance the public confidence in our election processes and election integrity.\"\\nAccording to county documents, the impetus for this resolution by County Board Chair Jeffrey Schleif, was to address security and safety regarding the drop boxes after the Wisconsin Supreme Court reinstated their use for absentee voting in July 2024.\\nThat decision reversed the 2022 Wisconsin Supreme Court ruling that ballot drop boxes were illegal.\\nAccording to county documents, Washington County provided funding for extended hours for in-person absentee voting and provided funding for voluntary municipal-level audits.\\nMore:Here\\'s what to know about getting, returning an absentee ballot in Wisconsin\\nIt is up to each municipality in the county to decide if they want surveillance for their absentee drop boxes, according to the county.\\n\"We can\\'t require them to have surveillance,\" said Reichert. She also said that this may be more applicable to the towns in Washington County where most do not have surveillance cameras in place.\\nGermantown Village Administrator Steven Kreklow weighed in by saying he is reviewing the proposal to see if the village will take advantage of it. He said the village uses a drop box, and it is constructed right outside of its village hall at N112 W17001 Mequon Road.\\n\"It is pretty secure, and there are controls in place (to make it secure),\" he said. He also said that there may be a lot of operating costs in terms of public record requests and other issues he needs to research.\\n\"I don\\'t know if the cameras are necessary in Germantown,\" he said.\\nReichart added that she is not aware of any additional costs having video surveillance would cost each municipality.\\nMunicipalities throughout Wisconsin have contested the use of absentee ballot drop boxes ahead of the presidential election.\\nThe City of Brookfield\\'s Common Council voted to not have election ballot drop boxes in August for this upcoming election. To have these drop boxes Brookfield would need a surveillance camera, storage of video footage, decals, extra keys and security seals for the unstaffed box, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. Also, at least two people would be required to remove ballots and chain of custody logs would have to be completed.\\nWhen this was decided at the Aug. 20 meeting, many residents objected saying that the ballot boxes provide more accessibility for voting, especially for people who cannot vote in person.\\nLike Brookfield, the City of New Berlin, voted to eliminate election drop boxes at its July 2024 common council meeting, according to city documents.\\nWausau\\'s Common Council will discuss the use of a drop box at its Tuesday, Oct. 8 meeting after Mayor Doug Diny brought forward a resolution to direct the clerk to not use a drop box to collect absentee ballots.\\nCity Clerk Kaitlyn Bernarde, said to the Wausau Daily Herald that she does not want the Common Council to vote on this. She cited that the drop box has the following security measures: 24/7 video surveillance, the box is bolted to the pavement, a small opening to only accept paper and envelopes and two staff members collect, log and secure the ballots.\\nFor more information, visit www.washcowisco.gov/meetings\\nMore:Wisconsin election officials issue guidance to clerks on using absentee ballot drop boxes\\n(This story was updated to add new information.)',\n",

       "   'summary': 'Domestic violence killings are among the most preventable types of homicide.\\nBut in Wisconsin, where domestic violence deaths remain high, funding to help victims is vanishing.\\nLast year, 85 people died in acts of domestic violence in Wisconsin, about one death every four days, according to a report released Tuesday by End Domestic Abuse Wisconsin. The report includes the deaths of perpetrators who died by suicide or law enforcement action.\\nAlthough it\\'s a decline from the 96 lives lost in 2022, it is still the second-highest annual total since the organization began recording data in 2000.\\nThe new report serves as a memorial to victims and a call to action with an introduction that reads, in part: \"Fund us, and we\\'ll save lives,\" and \"Survivors deserve better today, while they are still alive.\"\\nIn recent weeks, organizations across Wisconsin have been forced to lay off staff, cut hours and reduce services that help victims safety plan and access other resources.\\n\\'I don\\'t even know what to say because I\\'m terrified,\" said Katie Bement, executive director of Embrace, a victim service provider that covers four counties in northwest Wisconsin and has cut several staff positions and reduced shelter capacity.\\n\"I know people are going to die from this,\" she said.\\nAs early as last fall, organizations in Wisconsin had been bracing themselves for a potential 70% drop in federal funding for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. The funding from the federal Victims of Crime Act flows into crime victim offices within each state and then is distributed.\\nOngoing efforts to shore up funding, as well as changing guidance on exactly how much money would be available, made it difficult for service providers to plan for the shortfalls.\\nFederal pandemic relief aid and a bipartisan $10 million stopgap measure delayed the deepest cuts, but those were temporary solutions. The funding shortfall predicted last year by advocacy organizations and officials has now become reality.\\nIn September, Wisconsin announced it was funding 99 programs, a drop from 135 the year before. It provided full funding for only 22 of them, and funding was capped at $250,000 for each organization.\\n\"Eight-five people, 85 souls,\" said Monique Minkens, End Abuse\\'s executive director, reflecting on the toll of deadly domestic violence.\\n\"We have to have more funding,\" she said. \"There is no getting around it.\"\\nSPECIAL REPORT:Domestic violence deaths are rising. Children are witnessing them. Inside the crisis facing Milwaukee County.\\nNo part of the state is untouched by domestic violence.\\nDomestic violence homicides took place in 22 of Wisconsin\\'s 72 counties last year, with about 42% occurring in rural areas and 58% in urban areas, according to End Abuse\\'s annual report.\\nFifty-four people were killed in domestic violence homicides last year, a decline from the 68 victims in 2022. The victims\\' ages range from 1 to 83 years old, with an average age of 41.\\nPerpetrators\\' ages ranged from 16 to 81 years old, with an average age of 38. Twelve perpetrators died by suicide, seven were killed by responding law enforcement and five others died by suicide during a law enforcement response, the report found.\\nTwo dozen other deaths caused by family violence were noted in the report but not included in the total. These deaths did not have a direct tie to intimate partner violence, which involves a victim and suspect in a romantic or sexual relationship, including current or past dating partners.\\nConsistent with past trends, firearms remained the most common weapon and were used in 78% of domestic violence homicides last year. National research has found that access to a gun makes it five times more likely that a woman will die at the hands of a domestic abuser, the report noted.\\nNational and statewide research in recent years has found victims of domestic violence homicides often have little or no previous contact with law enforcement — often the result of a mix of mistrust and fear of what will, or will not, happen as a result.\\nVictim service providers have tried to fill in that gap, but sometimes victims do not know organizations exist, are not comfortable reaching out or are not aware of the kinds of support available.\\n\"Having a shelter open and the doors wide open, and somebody staffing that phone 24 hours a day absolutely is essential,\" said Courtney Olson, executive director of Rainbow House, which serves Marinette, Oconto, and Florence counties. Olson also analyzed data for End Abuse\\'s annual homicide report.\\nBecause of the federal cuts, the staff is taking a 10% reduction in hours and pay, and the shelter will be closed on Friday afternoons, the first time Rainbow House has ever been closed during business hours since its creation in 1978, she said.\\n\"You won\\'t be able to just walk in for a restraining order or a safety plan, it\\'s not going to be business as usual,\" Olson said. \"Moving forward, we\\'re going to have to schedule these things, and domestic violence doesn\\'t operate well on schedule. People\\'s lives are in crisis, and normally they need help at the time that they need it.\"\\nThe Asha Project, the only culturally specific provider for African American women in Milwaukee, is expecting to lose two of its eight staff positions after its federal grant award dropped from about $123,000 to $51,000, said Antonia Drew Norton, Asha\\'s founder.\\nAsha had hoped to expand services, as demand for services had grown during the COVID-19 pandemic, she said.\\nThe need is particularly acute for Black women, who are disproportionately victimized by lethal domestic violence. A peer-reviewed medical study released this year found that Black adult women in the U.S. are six times more likely to be killed than their white counterparts. In Wisconsin, Black women were 20 times more likely than white women to die by homicide in 2019-2020, the study found.\\n\"I am fearful that we will not be there, be available, be open, during the times somebody really needs us,\" Drew Norton said.\\nPAST COVERAGE:Fatal domestic violence is on the rise. Here\\'s what\\'s being done about it in Milwaukee.\\nIn Wisconsin, the federal VOCA money is distributed from the state Department of Justice\\'s Office of Crime Victim Services as grant funding to local providers.\\nVOCA has steadily declined in resources since 2018. The pool of money comes from fines and penalties collected in federal criminal court cases. Congress did address the funding formula in so-called \"VOCA Fix\" legislation in 2021 but it will take years before the fund is fully replenished.\\nThis year, the state has capped VOCA funding at $250,000 for each organization, even though more than 40 organizations received larger amounts in the past. In addition, the state awarded local providers about $13.5 million this fall for a three-year funding cycle — which equates to a 70% cut in VOCA funding.\\nEmbrace, which serves about 2,000 survivors annually across Rusk, Washburn, Barron and Price counties, has experienced some of the deepest cuts. It previously received about $650,000 in VOCA funding and now will receive about $118,000, said Bement, who has been Embrace\\'s executive director for 11 years.\\n\"I\\'ve never seen anything like this before,\" she said. \"With nonprofits, you\\'re used to ebbing and flowing with grants. This is core funding for basic lifesaving services that prevent homicides.\"\\nTo offset the federal funding loss, the state Department of Justice, led by Attorney General Josh Kaul, has requested $66 million in the next state budget cycle for victim service providers over two years. That proposal includes at least $16 million for sexual assault services and $20 million for domestic abuse services over two years.\\nBlack and Brown Womyn Power Coalition, End Domestic Abuse Wisconsin and the Wisconsin Coalition Against Sexual Assault issued a statement last month in support of the DOJ budget request to Gov. Tony Evers.\\nIn a statement, Britt Cudaback, spokeswoman for Evers, called supporting crime victims a \"top priority\" for the governor\\'s administration, noting he had directed pandemic federal relief resources to support survivors and their families.\\n\"The governor looks forward to continuing to build upon his efforts to prevent violence and keep kids and families safe in his next biennial budget, and he remains committed to working to get victims, survivors, and their families the resources they need, including continuing to fight for the real, meaningful, and sustainable federal investments the VOCA program deserves,\" she said.\\nIn the meantime, Bement and other advocates are calling on people across the state to support their neighbors, friends and relatives.\\n\"We need our communities to donate to help get us through this, so our doors stay open through this,\" she said. \"We need people to vote and we need to really feel like all of us have a responsibility for caring for survivors.\"',\n",

       "   'summary': 'Employee engagement has become critical in achieving business success, especially in a competitive market like the restaurant industry. Creating an environment where employees feel valued and driven is more than simply a business strategy for Jason\\'s Deli, a national restaurant renowned for its fresh ingredients and warm service—it\\'s a fundamental part of their culture. But like many businesses, Jason\\'s Deli shifted their focus to maintaining the business fundamentals during COVID, resulting in them putting a pause on innovation efforts. Once they were ready to refocus on innovation, they discovered their current solution for capturing and managing ideas would no longer be supported. To address this, Jason\\'s Deli partnered with Ideawake, a leading platform in the idea management space, to foster a culture of innovation from within. By empowering employees to contribute their ideas and solutions, Jason\\'s Deli aimed to enhance engagement, improve operational efficiency, and drive growth. \"Our goal with Jason\\'s Deli was to create a platform where every employee, from the front line to management, feels empowered to share their ideas,\" says Coby Skonord, CEO of Ideawake.\\nIndustry data underscores the importance of this effort. According to Gallup, organizations with high employee engagement levels are 21% more profitable than their less engaged counterparts. Yet, despite the clear benefits, achieving and maintaining high engagement remains a complex task, especially for companies with diverse, dispersed teams like those at Jason\\'s Deli. Seeing these difficulties, Jason\\'s Deli saw a chance to implement a significant improvement. They collaborated with Ideawake to implement a solution that fosters employee idea generation and incorporates it into the business\\'s larger growth and development plan. By doing this, they aimed to directly tackle the engagement gap and use their most important resource—their employees—to foster creativity from within.\\nThe partnership between Jason\\'s Deli and Ideawake was established with clear objectives: to boost employee engagement, increase idea generation, and drive meaningful innovation across the organization. Ideawake helps create a more inclusive and motivated workforce by directly engaging employees in problem-solving. The partnership\\'s initial goal has been to promote idea submissions to improve customer service and operational efficiency. Employee involvement at Jason\\'s Deli has increased significantly, as seen by the notable rise in suggestions provided. The platform\\'s transparent procedure enables employees to witness the evaluation and, in many cases, implementation of their proposals, which incentivizes them further. Employees are driven by the chance to influence the company\\'s progress directly.\\nThis is how it operates: Workers at Jason\\'s Deli are welcome to propose solutions for solving problems, such as enhancing customer service or expediting kitchen processes. These concepts fall under specific challenges that the management team has developed. These subjects center on essential areas for improvement, like simplifying work processes, improving profitability, and becoming an employer of choice. Employees are encouraged to participate through Ideawake\\'s gamification system, which gives them points and peer acknowledgment for their work, which fosters a spirit of friendly rivalry and engagement among all staff members. Following submission, ideas are assessed by managers and peers using a voting mechanism to determine which suggestions show the most promise. A committed team then assesses the viability and effect of the top-rated proposals. An accepted idea is given to an \"idea owner\" who assembles a multidisciplinary team to implement the idea. The Ideawake platform allows for immediate progress tracking, and after a concept has been fully implemented, its ROI can be tracked directly in the platform.',\n",

       "   'summary': \"Stargazers in the northern hemisphere will have the chance to observe the Draconid meteor shower as it peaks Monday evening into early Tuesday morning.\\nThe Draconids are somewhat of an oddity when it comes to meteor showers, in that they will be most visible in the evening hours rather than the early morning, according to EarthSky. The meteor shower's radiant point − the point from which they appear to emanate from − is the Draco, or dragon, constellation, which is at it's highest point in the evening.\\nThe moon will only be 27% illuminated Monday night into Tuesday, per EarthSky, allowing for better visibility.\\nBest viewing for the Draconids is expected to be the later evening hours of Oct. 7 and into the early morning of Oct. 8.\\nCompared to something like the Perseid meteor shower, the Draconids are a bit more demure. At most, one might see up to 10 meteors streaking across the night sky per hour. The Draconids are also notable for their relatively slow speed as they enter Earth's atmosphere − around 23 kilometers, or 14 miles, per second − meaning that those meteors that can be seen may appear for a full 1-2 seconds.\\nThe reason for the relative lack of meteor activity with the Draconids lays with Jupiter and its immense gravity. As the comet 21p/Giacobini-Zinner − the source of the Draconids − makes its more than six year orbit around the sun, its long tail of ice bits and rock are often drawn closer to the gas giant. Occasionally, though, the Draconids can approach closer to Earth and put on a show. In 1933 and 1946, thousands of meteors were sighted per hour, and in 1985, 1998 and 2018 there were also increased meteor counts. In 2011, European observers were able to see more than 600 meteors in one hour, according to EarthSky.\",\n",

       "   'summary': 'Wisconsinites can hold off on grabbing their snow boots for a little longer as it looks to be a rather mild and slightly wet fall, a weather pattern that could continue through winter.\\nThe annual National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\\'s U.S winter outlook report from the Climate Prediction Center says that La Niña conditions are strongly expected throughout the country. The U.S. has a 74% chance of La Niña conditions, while there is a 40% chance of this being a moderate event.\\nLa Niña events are the periodic cooling of ocean surface temperatures in the central and east-central equatorial Pacific, according to the National Weather Service. This period usually happens every 3 to 5 years, but can also pop up on occasion. Last year, the U.S. dealt with El Niño conditions, which is the opposite of La Niña, meaning the ocean warms to above-average sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean.\\nDuring La Niña events, the northern part of the United States typically sees colder and stormier winter conditions while it is warmer and less stormy across the south.\\nAccording to NWS, it appears the majority of the state, specifically in western, northern, and southern Wisconsin, have a 33%-40% chance for above normal temperatures this fall. The eastern border of the state, including northeast Wisconsin, have an even higher likelihood of such temperatures, in the 40%-50% range.\\nMeanwhile, the whole state has equal chances of precipitation this fall. Equal chances means that there is an unlikelihood of the weather going into a specific direction, as no direction is being favored. The northern part of the Midwest, with parts of Illinois and Iowa are forecast to deal with below normal percentages of precipitation.\\nA majority of the Midwest, including Wisconsin, appears to be in the equal chances bubble when it comes to milder, or colder, winter temperatures. A majority of the state does look to have above normal chances for precipitation this winter, with a 40%-50% probability.\\nThe NOAA winter forecast does not specify how much precipitation will fall as rain, snow or ice, only that more or less is likely overall. Snow forecasts depend upon the strength and track of winter storms, which generally cannot be predicted more than a week in advance, meteorologists say.\\nWisconsin looks to be in the \"cold, wet and white\" category for winter weather this year, according to the Farmer\\'s Almanac.\\nYou can also see on the map below shades of dark blue on the western borders of the state, which indicate cold and average snowfall this winter.',\n",

       "   'summary': \"After the New York Mets eliminated the Milwaukee Brewers in crushing fashion Thursday night in Game 3 of the National League wild-card series, Rhys Hoskins pulled up a chair in the corner of an empty, nearly-silent clubhouse and held court with his teammates for roughly a half hour.\\nIt was the sign and scene of a group of players that knew this would likely be their last time ever in the same room together.\\nBut while the team will look different when spring training convenes next February, it sounds like Hoskins will still be present.\\nHoskins is coming off a disappointing first year with the Brewers after signing a two-year, $34 million contract that includes an opt-out following the 2024 season. The opt-out carries a $4 million buyout from the Brewers, but if he doesn't exercise it he would receive a base salary of $18 million from Milwaukee in 2025.\\nFollowing the worst season of his career – Hoskins batted .214 with a .722 OPS, 26 home runs, 82 runs batted in and went hitless in nine postseason at-bats – taking the player option and remaining with the Brewers for $18 million next year would seem to be the likely scenario.\\nHere's how Hoskins responded when asked about his future following Game 3:\\n'It's the type of group you want to be a part of,' Hoskins said. 'There's a ton of talent here. Surprised everybody this year. I don't think we'll be a surprise next year. We've got a lot to get through first and foremost, obviously the disappointment. I said this right when I signed, I said this throughout the year: the most important thing is being on a winner. This is absolutely a winning team.'\\nMore: Here's the contract status of Milwaukee Brewers players headed into the offseason\\nMore: What you need to know about the Milwaukee Brewers' offseason, free agents, contracts, potential roster moves and more\\nThose quotes sound like someone expecting to return to the Brewers next year. Is that Hoskins' plan?\\n'I don't know. Whenever the (option) deadline is, we'll get to an answer then,' he said. 'I have to do my due diligence. This is a great place to be. I've enjoyed the heck out of myself. I love these guys. This city, this organization has welcomed me with open arms and we have a chance to win everytime we step on the field.'\\nIf Hoskins were to opt out of his deal, it would be questionable as to whether he would even receive a multi-year contract from a team coming off the year he had. If he did, it likely would not equal the $22 million total ($18 million salary plus a $4 mutual option buyout for 2026) Hoskins is guaranteed if he picked up his player option with the Brewers.\\nThe first baseman also seemed to enjoy his time playing under manager Pat Murphy as one of the club's veteran leaders.\",\n",

       "   'summary': 'One more election in 2024, and one more referendum on your Wisconsin ballot. Yes there is a fifth and final statewide referendum Nov. 5 and it\\'s just as confusing as the previous four.\\nThis question, similar to the others, is asking to change the wording in our state constitution. What\\'s different this time is that nothing functionally changes if the referendum passes.\\nThat\\'s because the question is about preventing any future attempt at allowing noncitizens to vote in Wisconsin despite the fact that, today, noncitizens are not allowed to vote in any election in Wisconsin. Nor is there any legislation proposed that would allow them to do so.\\nCurrently, section 1 of article III of the Wisconsin constitution says: \\'Every United States citizen age 18 or older who is a resident of an election district in this state is a qualified elector of that district.\"\\nThe question on the ballot reads: \\'Eligibility to vote. Shall section 1 of article III of the constitution, which deals with suffrage, be amended to provide that only a United States citizen age 18 or older who resides in an election district may vote in an election for national, state, or local office or at a statewide or local referendum?\\'\\nDid you spot the difference?\\nIf you vote \\'Yes,\\' you are voting that you want the word \\'every\\' to be changed to \\'only\\' and to add the clarifying language that it applies to all elections and referendums, whether local, state or national. If you vote \\'No,\\' you are voting to keep the current language in the constitution.\\nNothing practically changes if \\'every\\' becomes \\'only,\\' because nowhere in Wisconsin are noncitizens currently allowed to vote. There is a federal law that prevents noncitizens from voting in federal elections and there are no cities, towns or villages in Wisconsin that allow noncitizens to vote in local elections.\\nThis is scary stuff:Project 2025 spells out second Trump term in alarming detail.\\nThere hasn\\'t been any proposed bills in the Legislature to allow noncitizens to vote and even the Wisconsin Elections Commission has testified that it has only knows of four alleged cases of election fraud related to citizenship in the last decade.\\nChanging the language is meant to prevent any future hypothetical scenario where municipalities would vote to extend voting rights to noncitizens in local elections by expressly prohibiting it.\\nSupporters of the proposed constitutional amendment have pointed to municipalities in other states that let noncitizens vote in races for city council or school board as the motivation behind this change. They say the amendment is key to making sure that such a thing doesn\\'t take hold in Wisconsin.\\nSo, where is noncitizen voting legal? Not a single state currently allows noncitizens to vote in statewide elections.\\nHowever, three states and Washington DC have municipalities that allow noncitizens to vote in certain local elections. Washington, DC, recently enacted a law to allow noncitizen residents to vote in all non-federal elections. In California, San Francisco allows resident noncitizen parents and guardians to vote in school board elections and Oakland is currently attempting to enact a similar law. Additionally, some cities in Maryland and Vermont permit noncitizens to vote in municipal elections.\\nHis daughter\\'s heart stopped.An act of kindness brought him comfort.\\nIn 2021, New York City actually did enact a law allowing noncitizens to vote in local elections in, but it was ruled unconstitutional by a state judge in 2022.\\nThe argument these municipalities have made is that long term residents and green card holders pay taxes, are members of their community and thus impacted by local services.\\nBoth supporters and opponents of this change only have hypotheticals as arguments to vote yes or no. How important is it to you to close the door on any rogue municipality deciding that they are going to allow noncitizens to vote in local elections? Alternatively, how worried are you that by changing the word \\'every\\' could be interpreted by a court to remove voting rights in the future?\\nFor me, this seems like a prime example to apply the old saying, \\'if it ain\\'t broke, don\\'t fix it.\\'\\nI\\'m just hoping this is the last referendum explainer I have to do for a while.\\nIn the last two years, Republicans have put seven constitutional amendment questions on Wisconsin election ballots:\\nThe last time there was this much constitutional amendment activity in Wisconsin, it was 1982. Let\\'s hope that with our new legislative maps there will be more balance in the State Legislature in 2025 and bring this governing by confusing constitutional amendment referenda era to an end. Or at least another 40 year hiatus.',\n",

       "   'summary': \"INGLEWOOD, Calif. - Following are four bonus observations by columnist Pete Dougherty after the Green Bay Packers' 24-19 win over the Los Angeles Rams:\\nPackers receiver Dontayvion Wicks has had a rough couple of weeks catching the ball. Wicks had three drops last week against Minnesota, and on Sunday he had a big drop against the Rams that would have gone a long way toward clinching the game in the final 3½ minutes if he'd come up with the catch.\\nIt came on a third-and-10 from the Packers' 43 with 3:16 to play. Wicks beat cornerback Darious Williams on a double move, and quarterback Jordan Love took the deep shot rather than trying to just get the first down or a short completion that at least would have kept the clock moving.\\nWicks went over Williams for a contested catch, but the ball went right through the receiver's hands. The Packers' led 24-19 at the time, and had Wicks caught it they probably would have needed only one more first down to kill the rest of the clock. Short of that, they'd at least have been in position to run down the clock some more and then try a field goal that would have put them up eight points.\\n'When it comes Sunday we've got to go out there and make plays, and that's everybody, not just him,' Love said of Wicks after the game. 'It's me, it's everybody. It's all about going out there and making those plays. I know he'll bounce back from it. He's proven what he can do for sure. The ball's going to keep coming his way.'\\nRookie kicker Brayden Narveson appears to have lived to fight another day, whereas punter Daniel Whelan had his first rough outing of the season.\\nNarveson, who had missed four field goals in his first four games, made his lone field goal attempt of the game, a 46-yarder on the final play of the first half. He also made all three of his extra points.\\nWhelan was booming the ball to start this season and in the first four games had a gross average of 45.7 yards, a net of 41.6 yards, and had seven punts downed inside the 20. But Sunday he hit several lower, shorter punts, and his five attempts finished with a gross and net average of 37.2 yards, with only one downed inside the 20.\\nLove's 53-yard bomb to Jayden Reed set up the Packers' first touchdown, but even though it worked Love admitted after the game he probably shouldn't have thrown it.\\nReed was surrounded by three Rams players when he came down with the ball at the Rams' 2.\\n'It's one of those plays, they rolled the coverage to the DB and he played the deep half in Cover 2,' Love said of cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon. 'The way he was going back I didn't think he was that deep but he was pretty deep. Definitely not a great decision on my part. But when you've got a playmaker like J Reed who's going to go up and make you right, it helps. Just a great play by J Reed right there.'\\nThe Rams often face a high percentage of road fans when they play at home, and Sunday was no exception. The crowd at SoFi Stadium appeared to be at least 50 percent Packers fans and possibly more, with 'Go Pack Go' chants regularly ringing out.\",\n",

       "   'excerpt': \"Contrary to Hovde's claims, people ages 85 and older have the highest rates of suicide. And a growing concern is rural men.\",\n",
       "   'summary': 'Eric Hovde, the Republican businessman challenging U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, claimed on a Wisconsin-based conservative radio talk show that transgender youths have the highest rate of suicide in the United States, a result of regretting their gender transition.\\nScientific studies show that\\'s false on both counts — the rate and the regret.\\n\"The highest rate of suicide in our country (is) young people who went through a transition. They wake up and realize that this did not cure their underlying mental health problems, and now they\\'re even more messed up and they commit suicide at the highest rate of any group in our society,\" Hovde told conservative radio host Joe Giganti on \"The Regular Joe Show\" last Thursday. The nationally syndicated show originates out of Green Bay.\\nHis comments appear to be part of a broad focus on transgender issues. He has said before — and repeated again on The Regular Joe Show — that Baldwin earmarked public money for a transgender clinic. PolitiFact Wisconsin rated this claim false. The organization Hovde was referring to is actually a homeless youth shelter in Dane County.\\nAcross the country, LGBTQ+ issues have been part of this fall\\'s campaigns.\\nContrary to Hovde\\'s claims, people ages 85 and older have the highest rates of suicide, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control. That population accounts for 21% of all confirmed suicides, according to preliminary data.\\nRelated:Older Wisconsinites have the highest suicide rate of any age group. Why don\\'t we talk about it?\\nRelated:Wisconsin\\'s suicide numbers have reached historically high levels for the 2nd year in a row\\nAdditionally, men over 25, and particularly rural men with quick access to firearms, have the highest growing rate of suicide in Wisconsin, a result of social isolation, financial stress and job loss, among other factors. In 2021, the most recent year for complete data, nearly 200 rural men in Wisconsin died by suicide, about one in every five suicides. Two-thirds of those men used firearms as their method. A quarter of the state\\'s rural men who died by suicide had military experience.\\nAnother population flagged by the department is girls aged 10 to 19. In 2021, 1,340 girls in this age group visited emergency departments across Wisconsin for self-harm-related injuries, with or without suicidal intent. Almost two-thirds of the girls who showed up at hospitals for self-harm in Wisconsin used drugs — whether prescription, legal or illegal — as a method of self-harm.\\nFurther, Black and Indigenous girls in Wisconsin are increasingly self-harming themselves at disproportionate rates.\\n\"I hear Hovde say he cares about youth mental health, and I invite him to put forth policies that will address the underlying issues actually fueling the youth mental health crisis we are facing,\" said Abigail Swetz, the executive director of Fair Wisconsin, one of the state\\'s largest LGBTQ+ advocacy groups.\\nLGBTQ+ youths in the United States do face higher rates of anxiety, depression and suicide than non-LGBTQ+ youths, but those mental health conditions are strongly linked to LGBTQ-based physical harm, discrimination, housing instability and attempts at conversion therapy by parents or legal guardians, according to a 2021 peer-reviewed study.\\nMore recently, Nature Human Behaviour, a peer-reviewed science journal under the umbrella of Nature, published a study in December showing that state anti-transgender laws (some of which are in Wisconsin) increased suicide attempts among transgender and non-binary young people in the United States. The study, done by current and former members of The Trevor Project, found that in states that enacted anti-transgender laws, incidents of past-year suicide attempts by transgender and non-binary youths increased anywhere between 7% and 72%.\\n\"For (trans and gender-nonbinary) young people, anti-transgender laws may signal a broader societal rejection of their identities, communicating that their identities and bodies are neither valid nor worthy of protection,\" the authors wrote. The Trevor Project is a nonprofit suicide prevention organization focused on LGBTQ+ youths.\\nSwetz denounced Hovde\\'s remarks, calling them wrong and accusing him of actively spreading disinformation. Fair Wisconsin PAC, the political action committee arm of the organization, recently endorsed Baldwin.\\n\"When transgender youth are supported and affirmed, they do just as well as their peers who aren\\'t trans. The real concern, then, is the impact of anti-trans policies and harmful statements like Hovde\\'s,\" Swetz said via email. \"Hovde is attempting to use the mental health of trans youth as a weapon in a political game, and frankly, that\\'s what I find disgusting. In fact, Hovde is so wrong about this that I have to assume he\\'s either intentionally lying, or just embarrassingly misinformed, and either way, it\\'s inexcusable.\"\\nHovde campaign officials did not respond to questions about the source of his information.\\nStudies have shown that support, affirmation and understanding have the most powerful effect on those transitioning.\\nThe Journal of American Medical Association published a report in 2022 demonstrating the power of gender-affirming medical interventions, with 60% lower odds of depression and 73% lower odds of suicidality.\\nFurther, detransitioning is rare, and among those who go through the process, regret is not their overriding emotion. In a study published in early 2023 by Infant and Child Development, young people who detransition sometimes even express gratitude for ending up with a better understanding of their identity.\\nAnd although Hovde and host Giganti talked at length about young people permanently mutilating and \"neutering\" their bodies, the majority of medical gender-affirming treatment involves gender-affirming therapy, clothing, and lifestyle choices — not surgery.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'INGLEWOOD, Calif. - There\\'s 1:05 left to play, and the Los Angeles Rams are facing a fourth-and-5 from the Green Bay Packers\\' 38-yard line.\\nMatthew Stafford\\'s pass intended for tight end Colby Parkinson falls incomplete.\\nLinebacker Edgerrin Cooper forces the pressure. Safety Evan Williams breaks up the pass. It\\'s a turnover on downs, and the Packers come away with the 24-19 win over the Rams on Sunday at SoFi Stadium.\\nThe Packers\\' defense is still a work in progress under new coordinator Jeff Hafley, but the unit has stepped up in key moments. It\\'s a group that leads the NFL in takeaways with 14 and is in the top 20 in total defense.\\nWhat excites the coaching staff is the young players delivering in critical roles.\\n\\'I think we\\'re special, man. I think we\\'re going to be together for a long time and the sky is the limit,\\' Packers safety Javon Bullard said about the rookie class. \\'I feel like we can do some really special things in this league, as long as we our heads straight and keep the right mindset.\\'\\nCooper came to Green Bay after a well-publicized career at Texas A&M. The linebacker has been dealing with injuries to start his rookie season. He was listed as questionable on the Packers\\' injury report this weekend with a hip injury. In the win over the Rams, Cooper finished with five total tackles, a sack, and his pressure on Stafford led to a quick throw and the turnover on downs in the final minutes.\\nHe has 13 tackles and 1.5 sacks on the season.\\n\\'I just wanted to get a lot of pressure so (Stafford) could hurry up and get it out,\\' Cooper said on the defensive stand. \\'I was on my tippy toes, ready to get there and get in the backfield.\\'\\nThe Packers drafted 11 players in the 2024 NFL draft. Bullard, Cooper and Williams have been notable bright spots through the first five games.\\nWilliams has split time with Bullard at strong safety. He\\'s appeared in every game this season and has 13 tackles and one interception. He had a career-high 10 total tackles (6 assisted and 4 solo) in the win over the Rams, including the pass breakup to seal the win.\\n\\'They honestly run that (play) quite a few times. I think I got a fourth-down stop on it in the red zone,\\' Williams said. \\'It\\'s a little follow route where the tight end\\'s at three, they motion one down and just try to get the post player out of it, and the tight end will run a little stutter and try to cross my face. I was in man on them both times. I just had a good feel for the route at the end of the game. They ran it so many times, I didn\\'t think he would try to break out and try to make a long throw. I was just sitting on it, he broke back in, able to get my hand in there and celebrate with the crowd.\\'\\nIt\\'s a group showing maturity and versatility. Packers coach Matt LaFleur said they wanted to change things up in the secondary, moving around Keisean Nixon and Bullard, to give opportunities to get more players, in particular Williams, on the field.\\n\"That was kind of the plan going in to put (Nixon) outside and put (Bullard) down in the nickel position, which opened up the door for Evan Williams,\\' LaFleur said. \\'That\\'s a luxury. We have confidence in all of those guys.\"\\nBullard finished with eight total tackles. He has 28 on the season.\\n\\'My job is to come in and contribute the way I know how,\\' Bullard said. \\'Doing what the coaches ask me to do, to be the best player I can be. Just being a team player and doing whatever I\\'m asked to do, I try to do it to the best of my ability.\\'\\nAdding these rookies to the likes of Xavier McKinney, Jaire Alexander, Preston Smith, Kenny Clark and others, the confidence with this group is growing.\\n\\'The future is real bright,\\' Cooper said. \\'We\\'ve got some dogs that were ready to come in and play.\\'',\n",

       "   'excerpt': 'Milwaukee starter Gary Trent Jr. exited with an elbow injury as the Bucks lose to Pistons, 120-87, in preseason opener.',\n",
       "   'summary': \"The Milwaukee Bucks opened their four-game exhibition slate with a 127-80 loss to the Detroit Pistons on Sunday night in Detroit at Little Caesars Arena. The Bucks spent Oct. 1-4 holding a remote training camp at the University of California-Irvine, a sojourn Bucks head coach Doc Rivers hoped would lay a strong foundation for a team that is looking to get out of the first-round of the playoffs for the first time since the 2021-22 season.\\nThe Bucks jumped out to a 20-3 lead in the early going and took a 39-28 first quarter lead behind 14 points from Damian Lillard and eight points from Brook Lopez. The team went 9-for-14 from behind the three-point line in the quarter as well.\\nThings began to go the other way in the second quarter, however, as the Pistons outscored the Bucks 32-19 to take a 60-58 lead into halftime. With the majority of the Bucks' primary rotation players subbing out in the third quarter, the Pistons outscored the Bucks 31-21 to take a 91-79 lead. Detroit outscored Milwaukee 29-8 in the fourth quarter.\\nMORE: Box score | Bucks schedule\\nBucks first-round pick AJ Johnson played 18 minutes, going 1-for-8 from the field for two points. He also handed out two assists and had three turnovers.\\nHere are three takeaways from the game:\\nAt the 2-minute, 53-second mark of the second quarter, Bucks guard Gary Trent Jr. was screened by Pistons big man Jalen Duren. Duren caught Trent Jr.'s left elbow, and the guard dropped to the ground immediately in clear pain. Trent then was helped off the court and immediately went to the locker room with what the Bucks called a hyperextension. He did not return to the game.\\nIn his Bucks debut, Trent started and played 13 minutes, scoring five points on 2 of 3 shooting. He was arguably the Bucks top offseason pickup, signing for a minimum deal after shooting 39% from behind the three-point line for Toronto last season.\\nShortly before this play, Duren was called for an illegal screen on Taurean Prince when he threw an elbow into Prince's chest that sent the newly acquired Bucks forward to the floor. Prince, however, was able to return to play.\\nMore:Five pressing questions for the Milwaukee Bucks as they enter the 2024-25 season\\nThe 34-year-old Bucks point guard told the Journal Sentinel over a couple days in the summer that he was really looking forward to this season because he's had a stable, steady offseason.\\nAnd in the preseason opener, playing without Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton, Lillard was 5-for-7 from the field for 14 points in just 7 minutes, 35 seconds of action in the first quarter. That included a 4-for-5 showing from behind the three-point line. He also handed out three assists as the Bucks scored 39 points in the opening frame.\\nLillard finished his night after playing 17 total minutes in the first half with 15 points and four assists to go with two rebounds.\\nOff an AJ Johnson turnover, Detroit broke out into a fastbreak – and at the 9:33 mark of the third quarter, Pistons guard Jaden Ivey went up for an explosive open-court dunk. But, Bucks forward Taurean Prince not only chased the play, but met Ivey at the rim for a clean, physical block on the right-handed slam attempt. Ivey hit the court safely and Prince roared as the Bucks collected the rebound.\\nYes, it's one play – but it's not often you'll see an eight-year veteran busting it back on defense end during a preseason game.\\nPrince played 16 minutes through three quarters. He scored five points, had five rebounds, two assists and two blocks.\\nAt 6 feet, 6 inches, Prince is expected to bring a switchable, defensive presence to the Bucks after playing 78 games for the Los Angeles Lakers last season.\\nDoc Rivers was asked before the game what he needs to see out of the young players on the Bucks roster this preseason:\\n'How well they play with others. This is a team with talented stars on it. You have Dame and Giannis. So, the key for them is how do they play with stars? Because they're gonna be role players on this team. And so, can they play well under those circumstances.'\\nNo. Giannis Antetokounmpo had not played a preseason opener since Dec. 12, 2020, against Dallas. It was the start of a short three-game exhibition slate, which began a truncated season that ended in a Bucks championship.\",\n",

       "   'excerpt': 'Packers have three potentially tough opponents in next four weeks, but have home field advantage in those games. The fourth is in Jacksonville.',\n",
       "   'summary': \"GREEN BAY – The Green Bay Packers play three of their next four games at home, for which they should be grateful, given their opponents. It won't be quite as advantageous to ticket-buying fans, however.\\nOver the next month, the Packers host the Arizona Cardinals and Houston Texans, travel to Jacksonville, Florida, to play the Jaguars, then host the Detroit Lions. All of those teams won games this weekend except the Lions, who were on a bye. All three won games against teams they could reasonably have been expected to lose to. Including the close loss to the Vikings two weeks ago, the Packers are 33-9 in Lambeau Field under head coach Matt LaFleur. Point being, home field advantage could be huge.\\nThe average get-in price for the three home games all increased, ranging from $189 (Cardinals) to $285 (Lions). The game in Jacksonville is cheaper, despite that team's victory over the Indianapolis Colts.\\nFor our look at Packers' tickets prices, we average the lowest ticket prices at 11 secondary-market websites: Event USA, Gametime, Green Bay Ticket Service, SeatGeek, StubHub, TicketIQ, Ticket King, Ticketmaster, TickPick, TicketSmarter and Vivid Seats.\\nNote that ticket brokers can add fees on top of the prices listed here, so actual costs might be higher.\\nThe following are secondary market ticket prices as of Monday and our guesses as to why they are where they are.\\nNote: Green package ticket holders have six home games this year. Gold package ticket holders, many of whom are from the Milwaukee area and southern Wisconsin, have all three NFC North games at Lambeau Field this season.\\nWhat is special about this game? Green package ticket holders return to Lambeau Field for the first time in a month. The Packers are winning games — three out of the last four — and any game in mid-October holds the prospect for excellent football weather. So at $189, the average get-in price is the highest it's been this season.\\nThis game might have been more expensive, except that this time of year, Wisconsin residents traditionally head to Arizona, not the other way round. The Cardinals have been very inconsistent this year, which discourages fans from spending money to travel to far away places.\\nThe Cardinals' Kyler Murray is the kind of running quarterback the Packers traditionally have the most trouble with. He passed for 195 yards on Sunday and ran for 85 more. The Packers played two quarterbacks like that this year in Philadelphia Eagles' Jalen Hurts and Indianapolis Colts' Anthony Richardson. They held them both in check, but at the cost of constraining their pass rush. They had two sacks against the Eagles and one against the Colts.\\nThe Packers lost three of the last four games against the Cardinals, including the last time Arizona was at Lambeau Field in 2018. The Cardinals won 20-17, Mike McCarthy was fired after the game, and Matt LaFleur was hired before the 2019 season. The Cardinals are 2-3, one game behind the Seattle Seahawks in the NFC West.\\nPackers lead the series 46-26-4.\\nWhat is special about this game? Another October noon game for the Green package ticket holders against one of the best quarterbacks in the league in C.J. Stroud. The Texans lead the AFC South with a 4-1 record, although their victories have been close, by two, six, four and three points, and their loss was a blowout to the Minnesota Vikings.\\nThe Packers won the last three games against the Texans, all before Stroud, who does not run often or far.\\nPackers lead the series 4-1-0.\\nWhat is special about this game? Jacksonville won its first game on Sunday, against the Indianapolis Colts. Jacksonville led 34-20 in the fourth quarter and ended up winning the game on a field goal with 17 seconds left. It is understandable why even Jacksonville fans aren't driving up prices to this game. This might be one of those games where Packers fans fill a significant portion of the stadium.\\nPackers lead the series 5-2-0, winning the last three games.\\nWhat is special about this game? Until the Minnesota Vikings discovered they have a quarterback, it was expected the Packers would battle the 3-1 Lions for the NFC North title. The Lions probably are still the team to beat, and having lost to the Vikings already, the Packers cannot afford many more division losses. Even the Chicago Bears, with one of the weakest schedules in the league (at least as of the start of the season), a good defense, and a two-game winning streak, can't be overlooked.\\nSo, interest in this game is high with both Lions and Packers fans. The September game at Lambeau Field last season, which Detroit won 34-20, is notorious among Packers fans for the number of Lions fans in attendance. Green package ticket holders blame Gold package holders for being too ready to sell their tickets. It should be noted, that was a Thursday night game, which is usually a problem for Gold package fans. Or at least a major annoyance.\\nThe Packers defeated Detroit at Ford Field on Thanksgiving Day, which signaled the Packers were a better team than their 4-6 record going into the game indicated. They defeated the Kansas City Chiefs the next week and finished the season 9-8 and earned a playoff berth.\\nThis being a Sunday afternoon game, Gold package fans are likely not as ready to sell, although Lions fans are just as ready to buy, which sends prices higher, up $24 since the start of the season. Expect this to be the NFL's hottest game in Week 9.\\nPackers lead the series 106-76-7.\",\n",

       "   'summary': 'Those who stayed up late through the lightning delay saw a thriller of a Sunday Night Football Game, with Dallas scoring in the final 30 seconds to beat Pittsburgh, 20-17.\\nThey also saw a full allotment of Wisconsin-connected football players.\\nFrom a milestone for Pewaukee native T.J. Watt to a huge play by a Dallas fullback from rural Wisconsin to another solid day from Cowboys tight end Jake Ferguson, here\\'s what you missed if you went to bed early.\\nIf we didn\\'t already reach this point, it feels safe to start referring to Pewaukee and University of Wisconsin alumnus T.J. Watt as \"future Hall of Famer,\" just like his older brother.\\nWatt reached 100 career NFL sacks with a strip sack of Dallas quarterback Dak Prescott in the second quarter, making him the second-fastest player to reach that mark. He turned the feat in 109 games, with only Reggie White (96) reaching that plateau faster. DeMarcus Ware needed 113 games to hit 100, while Bruce Smith needed 115, J.J. Watt 120, Lawrence Taylor 122, Jared Allen 122 and Von Miller 124.\\nAmong those on the list who are eligible, only Allen is not a Hall of Famer.\\nNot to be lost in the shuffle was that Nick Herbig joined him in registering the half-sack and forced fumble. The Hawaii native played for the Wisconsin Badgers, as well.\\nT.J. later registered a second sack in the game and now has 4.5 for the year and 101 in his career. Big brother approved of his arrival in the 100-sack club.\\nThe only problem is that Pittsburgh didn\\'t win the game.\\nPrescott rallied the Cowboys for a 4th and goal touchdown in the final seconds on a pass to Jalen Tolbert, a 4-yard completion that tipped the scales. The Cowboys arrived inside the 5-yard line thanks to a checkdown pass to Hunter Luepke, the 2023 undrafted free agent from North Dakota State who attended Spencer High School and played for the co-op between Spencer and Columbus Catholic.\\nLuepke already has seven receptions this year for 91 yards, plus four rushes for another 14 yards and eight total first downs. He\\'s playing just more than half of the Cowboys\\' offensive snaps.\\nFormer Badgers standout and Madison Memorial alumnus Jake Ferguson closed the year in a big way last year when he caught a career-best 10 passes against the Packers in the postseason, en route to 93 yards and three touchdowns. He\\'s continued racking up stats in 2024.\\nThough he missed a game with injury in Week 2, Ferguson is up to 22 catches for 229 yards this season, though he\\'s still looking for his first touchdown. Against the Steelers, he brought in six balls on seven targets for 70 yards.\\nDefensive tackle Isaiahh Loudermilk, a native of Kansas who played for Wisconsin, blocked a 38-yard field goal attempt by Dallas star field-goal kicker Brandon Aubrey in the third quarter.\\nLoudermilk sees the field of 17% of defensive snaps and 31% on special teams; he\\'s got a pass defended and five tackles this year.\\nWith Watt and Loudermilk, the Steelers all told have four Badgers contributing to Pittsburgh\\'s defense.\\nKeeanu Benton, a native of Janesville, has started four of the five games and has 10 tackles while playing an even half of Pittsburgh\\'s defensive snaps.\\nHerbig has started two games this year, with a forced fumble, fumble recovery and 2.5 sacks. He plays regularly on special teams and sees the field for just less than half of Pittsburgh\\'s defensive snaps.\\nIn other action Sunday, Andrew Van Ginkel\\'s pick-six for Minnesota loomed large when the Vikings defeated Aaron Rodgers and the Jets, 23-17, in London.\\nPlaying at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, where the Packers played two seasons ago, the former UW player picked off Rodgers and ran 63 yards the other way for a touchdown that spotted the Vikings a 10-0 lead. It was one of three interceptions Rodgers threw in the loss.\\nVan Ginkel played his first five NFL seasons with the Miami Dolphins before joining the Vikings this year on a two-year deal. He\\'s started all five games at linebacker, with now two interceptions returned for touchdowns, three sacks, 19 tackles and three total passes defended.\\nBay Port High School alumnus and former Badgers fullback Alec Ingold got into the end zone for a huge Dolphins score Sunday, plowing up the gut on 1st and goal for a fourth-quarter score that gave his team a 15-10 lead over New England with 4:24 to play.\\nThat wound up being the final score',\n",

Here\\'s what to know about the interview.\\nExclusive USA-TODAY polls:Harris losing ground with young Latino men\\nIn 2023, \"Call Her Daddy\" was Spotify\\'s second most popular podcast, according to the music-sharing website. \\'The Joe Rogan Experience\\' was the first. It is also the most popular among women, according to Variety.\\nThe podcast, created in 2018, releases new episodes on Wednesdays and Sundays and discusses relationship advice, mental health and other topics.\\nThe host went \"back and forth\" on the decision to interview the vice president.\\n\"But at the end of the day, I couldn\\'t see a world in which one of the main conversations in this election is women, and I\\'m not a part of it,\" she said. \"I\\'m so aware I have a very mixed audience when it comes to politics, so please hear me when I say my goal today is not to change your political affiliation.\"\\nCooper said she hoped the conversation between her and Harris would be treated the same as the conversations she had with her other guests.\\nThe episode, which is titled \"Vice President Kamala Harris,\" garnered plenty of responses from fans of the podcast, also known as the \"Daddy Gang.\" Some listeners criticized Cooper for delving into politics, while others came to the host\\'s defense.\\n\"One of my most favorite podcasts, and now I\\'ll never listen again,\" commented Lexie Skipper, a contestant on the first season of the reality TV show \"Love is Blind,\" on a post previewing Cooper\\'s interview with Harris. \"Unbelievable.\"\\nAnother fan of the podcast, which primarily focuses on women\\'s mental health, relationships, sex lives and sexuality, called the interview a \"horrible career move\" in an Instagram comment.\\nHowever, some fans praised the podcast host and defended her decision to interview the presidential nominee.\\n\"Imagine being a woman following a woman who created a podcast for the health/interest of women and being upset that she\\'s interviewing a woman who might potentially become the first woman president of the United States lol,\" commented another user.\\nThe two spoke about women\\'s issues brought up in the 2024 election season.\\nThe conversation ranged from sexual assault and abortion to comments made by Republican politicians about women without children.\\nThe presidential nominee used the interview to reaffirm her stance on abortion rights, deriding the restrictions placed in many states since the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade.\\n\"You don\\'t have to abandon your faith or deeply held beliefs to agree, the government shouldn\\'t be telling (a woman) what to do,\" Harris said in reference to having an abortion. \"If she chooses, she\\'ll talk to her priest, her pastor, her rabbi, her imam, but not the government telling you what to do and that\\'s what is so outrageous about it.\"\\nCooper also questioned how Harris deals with doubters and attacks made on her character.\\nAt first, Cooper debated whether or not she should speak about border patrol, fracking or the economy.\\n\"But then I realized you can hear about all of those issues on whatever news site you prefer,\" said Cooper. \"And let\\'s be real: I\\'m probably not the one having the fracking conversation. But the conversation I know I\\'m qualified to have is the one surrounding women\\'s bodies and how we are treated and valued in this country.\\nCooper and her team also invited Trump to discuss women\\'s issues on the podcast, she said.\\nWhen discussing the abortion bans being placed across the country, Cooper asked Harris if there were any similar laws that affect a man\\'s body.\\n\"No,\" said Harris, who laughed.\\nSome users on X, formerly Twitter, used that exchange to bring attention to the military draft as a law that affects men\\'s bodies.\\n\"The correct answer is, yes, the draft,\" said conservative talk show host Clay Travis.\\nOthers countered with the point that the last military draft was conducted 50 years ago.\\n\"The question was have men had their own Healthcare decisions made for them,\" said another X user, @DivinyPete. \"And the answer is no.\"\\nPeople online also criticized Harris for choosing to appear on the podcast amid the disaster response to Hurricane Helene, which ravaged the Southeast. However, the VP was in North Carolina meeting with officials on Saturday.\\nHarris met with Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer and Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles, to discuss disaster relief. The VP then met with families affected by the storm, which has killed over 200 people and left thousands without drinkable water, according to USA TODAY\\'s previous reporting.\\nContributing: Karissa Waddick, Rebecca Morin; USA TODAY',\n",

The video also circulated on Instagram and was shared by other Facebook users.\\nMore from the Fact-Check Team: How we pick and research claims | Email newsletter | Facebook page\\nThe video is from November 2016 and was edited to misrepresent Murray\\'s remarks. The full video shows the actor explaining why he thinks Trump was elected president in 2016. It does not show Murray endorsing Trump in the 2024 presidential race.\\nThe 28-second clip shows Murray stating that the \\'country is dissatisfied with the way that Washington has worked for the last couple of decades\\' and criticizing the federal government for not \\'working together at all.\\'\\nBut that video is unrelated to the 2024 election. It is from 2016 and was edited to misrepresent Murray\\'s remarks. The original version shows the actor explaining why he thinks Trump was elected president that year, not offering his endorsement for the upcoming November 2024 election.\\nFact check: Mike Pence quote about not voting for Donald Trump is fabricated\\nThe original, 76-second video was first posted to Facebook on Nov. 10, 2016 – two days after Trump was elected – by the European television show Tracks. It opens with a shot of Murray alongside on-screen text that states, \\'Bill Murray about Trump & the election outcome.\\'\\nThat shot was edited out of the version shared in 2024. So were several statements from Murray, including one in which he said he doesn\\'t think anyone foresaw Trump\\'s victory and another in which he said, \\'We\\'re going to see if the process works, if democracy really works.\"\\nThe original video concludes with Murray calling the situation \\'kind of exciting\\' because \\'we\\'ve never been here before\\' and \\'we\\'re going to see what we\\'re made of.\"\\nThere are no credible news reports about Murray endorsing any presidential candidate in 2024. The actor famously does not employ a manager or an agent, and he does not have any verified social media accounts. USA TODAY reached out to his attorney, David Nochimson, but did not immediately receive a response.\\nUSA TODAY previously debunked false claims that musician Taylor Swift said she regrets endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris in her presidential bid, that Coca-Cola cut ties with Swift over her endorsement and that Lady Gaga endorsed Trump.\\nUSA TODAY reached out to several social media users who shared the claim, but none who responded provided evidence to support it.\\nLead Stories debunked a version of the claim.\\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

The Department of Children and Family had interacted with the victims about two months prior to the boy\\'s death, state officials confirmed to USA TODAY.\\n\"The Bridgeport Police Department\\'s thoughts and prayers are with his entire family and friends,\" the agency posted in a news release.\\nEx-governor attacked walking dog:Two boys, ages 12 and 13, charged in assault on ex-New York Gov. David Paterson and stepson\\nOn the day of the attack, police wrote in the release, officers responded at 10 a.m. to an apartment building in the city for a report of a domestic violence call.\\n\\'Please help us,\\' the boy\\'s mother yelled to a dispatcher after dialing 911, according to an incident report obtained by People. \\'He\\'s hitting us with a bat!\" Not long after, the report continues, surveillance video captured the suspect \\'jumping out of an upper window and landing headfirst into a garbage dumpster before swinging the bat around.\\'\\nAt the scene, witnesses directed officers towards a man walking away from the area of the assault, police wrote, and detained the suspect. Additional officers entered the building and found a 33-year-old woman and her two children, 4 and 6, all suffering from life-threatening injuries sustained from what they said was blunt force trauma.\\nOfficers began life saving procedures and responding medical personnel transported the victims to area hospitals. The mother and her children all in critical condition when they arrived at the hospital, police said. The condition of the woman and her 4-year-old child were later upgraded to stable.\\nA preliminary investigation by detectives found the woman and her children were \"brutally assaulted\" by the suspect detained outside the apartment. Police identified the suspect as Sulaiman and said the victims knew their alleged attacker.\\nAt the scene, police arrested Sulaiman on multiple charges including attempted murder and one count of being a felon in possession of a firearm. Prosecutors upgraded one of the attempted murder charges after the boy died.\\nSulaiman, who police said lives in Bridgeport, was arraigned Sept. 26 at Bridgeport Superior Court. On Monday he remained jailed without bond.\\nCourt records show his case is being handled by the public defender\\'s office.\\n\\'Mr. Sulaiman will be arraigned on Thursday, October 10th, over the next few months all of the evidence will be reviewed by myself and Mr. Sulaiman,\" Bridgeport Judicial District Public Defender James J. Pastore told USA TODAY Monday. \"Afterward, we will decide how to proceed with the case. At this point, Mr. Sulaiman is cloaked with the presumption of innocence.\\'\\nThe boy\\'s cousin, Sasha Heron, said Jathan was on a ventilator prior to his death, WFSB-TV reported last week.\\n\\'He was always so happy and he just enjoyed life altogether,\" Heron told the outlet. \"No matter what was going on, he was always so happy with everybody.\"\\nJathan\\'s aunt, Sandra Escobar, also told the outlet Jathan\\'s mother said the suspect threatened to kill her and the children and the family had reported the abuse to authorities. The family said Jathan\\'s mother and Sulaiman had only been married \"a couple of months.\"\\n\"Today, my sweet 6-year-old nephew made his final journey as he gives the ultimate gift of life through organ donation,\" Jathan\\'s aunt Anna Escobar wrote in a fundraiser she created to help the family with funeral and medical expenses. \"After suffering unimaginable pain and losing his life due to a brutal and senseless act, he leaves behind a legacy of hope for others. His heart, full of love, will beat on, and his light will continue to shine through the lives he saves.\"\\nAs of Monday more than 300 people had raised about $14,000 to help the family.\\n\"Though we are shattered, we honor his strength, innocence, and the selfless act that will help others live,\" the boy\\'s aunt wrote. \"We will not rest until those who failed them are held accountable.\"\\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Jathan\\'s family.\\nNew \\'Menendez Brothers\\' documentary:Features interviews with Erik and Lyle \\'in their own words\\'\\nOn Friday, Bridgeport Superior Court records show, police also issued a warrant for Sulaiman\\'s arrest on a charge he violated probation in connection to an October 2021 assault. He pleaded guilty to charges of assault on a public safety officer, risk of injury to a child and violation of a protective order in September 2022, the records show and was sentenced to two years in prison followed by four years of probation.\\nConnecticut Department of Child and Family Services Commissioner Jodi Hill-Lilly told USA TODAY the agency is conducting a joint investigation with the Bridgeport Police Department after being notified of the boy\\'s killing.\\n\\'This shocking and horrendous incident once again draws attention to the escalation of domestic violence in our communities and the traumatic impact it has on children,\" the commissioner released in a statement following the boy\\'s death. \"Our sincere condolences are with this little boy\\'s family who now grieve his loss, as well as his friends, classmates and others who knew and interacted with him.\"\\n\"At the time of the incident, the department was not involved with the mother and children but had interacted with them approximately two months prior to the report being received,\" Hill-Lilly said.\\nThe commissioner said she could not comment further on the investigation as the case remains active and open.\\nIf you or someone you love is experiencing domestic violence call The National Domestic Abuse Hotline at 1-800-799-SAFE or visit www.thehotline.org.

       "   'summary': \"The EV market is in constant flux and Toyota has never been ahead of the game, and it's apparently still struggling to catch up. The automaker has been skeptical about EV adoption, and turned out to be mostly right about its predicted slump in the market, but the world is still moving towards all-electric vehicle adoption and Toyota must still eventually adapt. That adaptation is coming a little slower than planned now, as Toyota's plans for U.S.-built EVs have been pushed back a few months, according to a report from Nikkei.\\nMore EVs:The best electric SUVs of 2024\\nToyota reportedly had plans for a three-row all-electric SUV model to be built in Georgetown, Kentucky by the end of 2025, but those intentions have now been pushed back a few months to a planned early 2026 production start. Later in 2026, another new all-electric SUV is scheduled to begin assembly at a factory in Princeton, Indiana. The automaker has invested $2.7 billion in the new Kentucky and Indiana facilities so far. A planned Lexus vehicle to be built in the U.S. by 2030 has reportedly also been scrapped.\\nAccording to Nikkei, the delay is due to the company making adjustments to the three-row EV's design in light of slowing EV sales in the U.S. overall.\\nA North Carolina battery plant is expected to begin operations in 2025 to supply future Toyota EVs, with hopes of moving 1.5 million EVs a year globally by the end of 2026. Toyota hopes to have up to seven all-electric new vehicles on sale in the U.S. market by 2026, though obviously none will be assembled in the U.S. until that year. So far it only offers one Toyota and one Lexus EV in America, the sibling Toyota bZ4X and Lexus RZ 450e SUVs. We anticipate the additional five EVs will be mostly SUV models, especially larger ones, but we do expect an electric Tacoma pickup of some sort to come to the U.S. eventually as well.\",\n",

       "   'summary': 'Warning: Spoilers ahead from \"The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City\" Episodes 1-3.\\n\"The Real Housewives of Salt Lake City\" take Milwaukee.\\nOn a previous episode, Whitney Rose invited all of her castmates on a girls trip to Milwaukee, where she\\'d be doing her next drag show.\\nThe cast came to town earlier this year, and the first of two episodes featuring Brew City aired last week on Bravo. The second will air Wednesday night.\\nIt had terrific shots of the Cream City. It had excursions to Fiserv Forum for a Milwaukee Bucks game, the Potawatomi Casino Hotel and the National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum. And, we couldn\\'t avoid a \"Wayne\\'s World\" reference.\\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\\nOne of the city\\'s darkest chapters was also mentioned. Cast member Mary Cosby revealed that her father \"used to live like a street away\" from serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer, who drugged, murdered and dismembered 17 men, including 16 in Milwaukee.\\nHere\\'s a recap of Part 1 of the trip, from where the gals stayed to what they got into so far:\\nWhen Rose was packing, she went for \"pink, Milwaukee-esque, drag-esque, warm-esque.\"\\nHer next drag show would be at This Is It!, the oldest LGBTQ+ bar in Wisconsin and one of the oldest in the country. World-renowned drag superstar Trixie Mattel co-owns the bar, 418 E. Wells St., with George Schneider.\\n\"When you first told me you were going to Milwaukee in February I was like, \\'Oh, you must hate these girls,\\' \" Justin, Rose\\'s husband, said to her.\\nSoon after, we\\'re with Meredith Marks, who earlier this season, alleged that Rose copied her bath bomb biz. When Rose extended the Milwaukee invitation to all her cast mates, Marks said she wasn\\'t sure if she could make it.\\n\"Whitney wants us all to come to Milwaukee,\" Marks told her husband, Seth. \"This, like, set off 8,000 red flags.\"\\nSpoiler alert: Marks would end up going on the trip after all.\\nAs Angie Katsanevas was packing, she showed off the custom Greek flag sunglasses she was bringing along \"just in case we meet the Greek Freak,\" aka Bucks superstar Giannis Antetokounmpo.\\n\"Everyone\\'s a fan of the Greek Freak, so I could just wear these on the streets of Milwaukee,\" she told her husband, Shawn.\\n\"I think Giannis will see you,\" Shawn said.\\n\"You think Giannis will see me from a mile away?\" she asked.\\nWhile she initially bellered \"Milwaukee?!\" when Rose extended the invitation, it apparently didn\\'t take her long to come around. She told her husband she was excited for the getaway and thought it would be fun. But, not seeing eye-to-eye with Lisa Barlow atm, she hoped they\\'d find time on the trip to sort things out.\\nNext stop: MKE. The group — minus Mary Cosby, who opted to fly alone — took a private jet booked by Rose.\\n\"I love Milwaukee,\" Cosby said. \"It just kind of makes me think about my dad, because my dad is from Milwaukee.\"\\nThere was a stunning aerial view of Lake Michigan with Milwaukee off in the distance, which was followed up by shots of a \"Welcome to Milwaukee\" sign, the Milwaukee Art Museum, the Milwaukee River, North Point Water Tower, the Milwaukee Public Market and Usinger\\'s.\\nIn a cutaway, a producer asked Gay: \"Can you give me the correct pronunciation of Milwaukee?\\'\\n\"Miliwaukee. Miliwau-kay,\" Gay said. \"I learned that when I watched \\'Wayne\\'s World\\' and Gene Simmons spoke of Miliwau-kay. Wait, I meant Alice Cooper. Honest mistake.\"\\nThis is in reference to Cooper\\'s famed cameo in the 1992 movie, during which he eloquently shared a history lesson about the city with Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar backstage after a show.\\nCooper also taught Gay that Milwaukee means \"The Good Land\" in Algonquin, Gay noted.\\nThe housewives\\' Milwaukee home away from home was the Kinn Guesthouse, 600 N. Broadway. Owner Charles Bailey showed them to their luxe quarters.\\nWhile the ladies snacked on a yummy-looking spread, an emotional Barlow opened up about how her 19-year-old son Jack — who was on a mission in Colombia — was having health problems.\\nWhile Barlow wanted to go be with him, her son wanted to figure things out on his own. Cosby and Britani Bateman told her they\\'d be praying.\\nTo lighten the mood, Rose let the ladies in on where they\\'d be later that night: A suite at the Bucks game.\\n\"There\\'s two Greek Freaks in Milwaukee today,\" Katsanevas sang.\\nSince Cosby called Rose a bobblehead last year, they couldn\\'t not visit the National Bobblehead Hall of Fame and Museum while in town. Rose, Cosby, Bronwyn Newport and Meili Workman went there, while the others went to the Potawatomi Casino Hotel and played roulette.\\nThe bobblehead museum crew had their own game to play: A scavenger hunt, tracking down bobbleheads, including the Kelce brothers, Marilyn Monroe and \"The Golden Girls.\"\\nDustin Godsey, chief marketing officer of the Bucks and Fiserv Forum, met the ladies outside the arena. They chanted \"Giannis!\" on the way in.\\nBucks president Peter Feigin took the group front-row courtside while Antetokounmpo was warming up.\\nDamian Lillard went over to meet the ladies and oblige for photos. Rose FaceTimed her son in so he could meet Feigin. And, as Katsanevas posed for pics on the court in her Greek-ed out garb, she brushed elbows with Pat Connaughton.\\nGodsey swept the group up to their suite, which had an elaborate buffet awaiting them, including lobster corndogs and an ornately decorated cake.\\nWith basketballing going on in the background, Bateman Facetimed her on-again, off-again boyfriend, Jared Osmond (yes, of THE Osmond family). Katsanevas broke it to Bateman that Katsanevas\\' brow girl told her Osmond slid into her DMs. Bateman left the suite in tears and confided in Marks that she had suspected something was going on.\\nBack inside the arena, Gay was trying to catch a brat. Rose was avoiding a man. And, with help from Cosby, Katsanevas danced around with her giant Greek flag.\\nWe must say: Fiserv Forum, you looked dang good.\\nThe episode ended with Newport, Barlow and Gay getting into it over what they\\'ve said — or didn\\'t say — about others.\\nThe next \"RHOSLC\" episode airs at 8 p.m. CT Wednesday on Bravo. It\\'s available to stream the next day on Peacock.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'Natural disasters evoke feelings of helplessness, grief and anxiety. They disrupt our sense of normalcy and leave survivors wondering when it will all be over.\\nDr. M. Ed Kelley is medical director of behavioral health at Sweeten Creek Mental Health and Wellness Center, a campus of HCA Healthcare\\'s Mission Hospital. He provided strategies to deal with the onslaught of emotions any natural disaster like Tropical Storm Helene tends to evoke, strategies to navigate these emotions and signs you or those around you may be struggling and in need of a higher level of care.\\nThey bring up some of our core fears, Kelley said, and create feelings of helplessness.\\n\"Many people feel they have no ability to defend themselves,\" he said.\\nPeople also may feel a lot of grief over loss of property, normalcy, security and, obviously, lives.\\nKelley said natural disasters generate a lot of anxiety. When is the power coming back? When is the water coming back? Is everyone I know and love safe? How long am I going to have to live this way? Will I be able to feed myself four days from now?\\n\\'A storm like this hits at the core of the safety and security that most of us normally have from day to day,\\' Kelley said.\\nKelley said he tells everybody they need to start with themselves.\\n\\'It may sound trite, but if you are not taking care of yourself, you can\\'t take care of anybody else,\\' he said.\\nKelley said it is important to monitor how much you are sleeping and eating and if you are becoming overly emotional.\\nAnother challenge is that many people aren\\'t able to go to work. Kids may not be able to go to school. \\'You are no longer brushing your teeth at the same time every day,\\' Kelley said. \\'One of the first things to go during a disaster is the sense of normalcy.\\'\\nHe suggests getting back on a schedule. Parents can help by setting a time every morning for everyone to wake up, followed by setting times for activities like taking a walk. And start brushing your teeth at the same time every day.\\nAlso, get busy, Kelley suggests. Clear trees in your yard and in your neighborhood. Check in on your neighbors and spend time talking and hanging out with them, he said.\\nHe shared an experience in his own neighborhood, when a home with a Starlink unit was providing the only WiFi he and others could easily access.\\nAs folks gathered there to reach out to others online, they connected with one another as well, he said.\\n\\'It wasn\\'t the WiFi that was healing,\\' he said. \\'It was that sense of belonging and sharing our shared experiences with other people that was unbelievably, emotionally helpful for everybody.\\'\\nTrauma diffuses when you share it, Kelley said.\\n\\'You realize other people are having a similar experience,\\' he said. \\'Sharing that burden with one another really does help.\\'\\nAnd lastly, people have to be willing to accept help, Kelley said, whether that is in the form of shelter, food or water.\\n\\'I think when we are fragile, we need to accept that,\" hey said.\\nKelley said parents should look for signs of stress in their children.\\n\\'With kids, their appetite and sleep patterns are huge. If you are noticing huge changes in those two things, you know they are struggling,\\' he said.\\nMore: Helene\\'s human aftermath: Here\\'s what to know as children process post-disaster trauma\\nRather than talk about the stress and anxiety they are feeling, children and teens tend to get angry, have temperamental outbursts or become severely withdrawn.\\n\\'Kids are not as good as adults at identifying sadness and anxiety,\\' he said. \\'It tends to come out in behaviors.\\'\\nTo head that off, Kelley suggests asking your kids how they are feeling. Check in with them and ask how they are doing, he said.\\nThen, as he suggests for adults, Kelley recommends getting kids back on a schedule, too.\\nKelley again stressed the need to start taking care of yourself right away and engaging with other people.\\nIf you start having panic attacks or are having overwhelming feelings that you can no longer cope with life, or you are having thoughts of giving up or harming yourself, call 988, the suicide and crisis hotline, or bring yourself to an emergency room.\\n\\'Severe lack of sleep, severe anxiety and severe hopelessness and helplessness would be times I would suggest reaching out for help,\\' Kelley said.\\n\"During times like these, we are also unfortunately at a huge risk for dropping into heavy substance use,\\' Kelley said.\\nPeople use it to cope, but then it can trigger alcoholism and substance abuse problems.\\n\\'If that is becoming unmanageable, that is another reason to reach out for help,\\' he said.\\nSweeten Creek Mental Health and Wellness Center, located at 32 Apex Circle, reopened its day treatment program on Monday, Oct. 7.\\nThe adult program operates the following programs:\\nReferrals can be obtained through Missionhealth.org/MentalHealth or by calling 828-213-4696.\\nNorth Carolina\\'s Peer Support Warmline is for those in crisis who need to talk with a peer but who are not suicidal. Call 855-PEERSNC.\\nFor those experiencing thoughts of suicide, call 988.\\nFor life-threatening emergencies, call 911.',\n",

After proving to him that we were watching the entire time, Mr. Landry admitted that he took the alligator from this area but could not find the tags that were gifted to him for this hunt.

Mr. Landry also admitted that prior to agents making contact with him, he cut a dead \\'stiff\\' alligator loose from his line and let it float away.\\'\\nLandry was ticketed for failing to properly tag an alligator, which in Louisiana carries a maximum punishment of up to 120 days in prison and a $950 fine.\\nLandry subsequently told WAFB that he had \"nothing to say\" about the incident.',\n",

       "   'summary': \"The MLB postseason continues Tuesday evening with two NL Division Round games. The Dodgers visit the Padres down the road in San Diego, with the series tied at one game apiece and the Phillies find themselves in the same situation in their series with the Mets, just up to road a bit in New York. You can use the best MLB betting promos and bonuses to bet on any of these games or any others this postseason.\\nHere are the best sportsbook promos for MLB betting.\\nWhen you create a BetMGM account with the BetMGM bonus code SBWIRE, you're entitled to a protected first bet up to $1,500. That's the biggest bet limit out there among MLB betting promos.\\nHow does this work? You place a first bet on Major League Baseball. As long as this bet is in the $10 to $1,500 range — you get to choose — BetMGM has your back. If your first bet wins, then BetMGM pays you in withdrawable cash. But if your first bet loses, BetMGM returns the full amount to you in the form of bonus bets.\\nIf you bet $50 or more, you'll have five bonus bets — each of them worth 20% of your original wager. If you bet less than $50, then you'll have one bonus bet. You receive seven days to play your bonus bet(s).\\nWhen you sign up with the Caesars Sportsbook promo code SBWIRE1000, you're rewarded with a first bet up to $1,000 on Caesars. If your first bet falters, Caesars Sportsbook sends the amount of your first bet back to your account as one bet credit.\\nYou get 14 days to use your bet credit on any of the 20-plus sports available on Caesars Sportsbook's app — one of the nation's leading sports betting apps. Because Caesars Sportsbook abides by a 1X playthrough requirement like all these MLB betting promos, your bet credit must win just once for you to pocket the profit in cash.\\nThe Fanatics Sportsbook promo gives new customers up to $1,000 in bonus bets – up to $100 a day for the first 10 days after you open your new account.\\nTo participate, you must place a qualifying wager of $5 or more on any market with odds of -200 or longer each day. Once that bet settles, you will receive a bonus bet equal to the amount of your wager, up to $100.\\nWhen you set up a bet365 account with the bet365 bonus code SBKWIRE, you can take advantage of a First Bet Safety Net up to $1,000. There is also a secondary Bet $5, Get $200 in Bonus Bets offer you can choose, making it the most flexible of MLB betting promos.\\nIf you go with the First Bet Safety Net, then bet365 backs you when you make a first bet in the $10 to $1,000 range. If that first bet happens to lose, bet365 returns the amount of your wager to you in bonus bets. If you choose the bonus bets, you're sent $200 in bonus bets immediately upon placing your $5 first bet on Major League Baseball (or anything else) on the bet365 site. You'll get seven days to use your bonus bets from either offer. Whenever one wins, enjoy the profit in cash.\\nThe DraftKings promo code gives new users $200 in bonus bets instantly after they sign up and make a minimum first wager of $5. Your first bet doesn't even need to win – or even settle. You'll get eight $25 bonus bets as soon as you make your first wager of $5 or more.\\nThose bonus bets have a seven-day expiration, and anything you win while playing the bonus bets is yours.\\nWhile we're on the MLB betting promos bonus bets train, let's check out our final welcome offer: Register for a FanDuel account with the FanDuel promo code and, when you place a $5 first bet, you'll earn $300 in bonus bets, if that bet wins.\\nYou can look outside of MLB if you want, such as UFC odds or anything else you might be interested in.\\nYour bonus bets will hit your account within 72 hours after your first bet settles and you have seven days to use them. One cool thing: FanDuel allows you to chop that $300 into as many (or as few) bonus bets as you want to make. Each time one wins, you win cash.\\nSigning up for these MLB betting promos and bonuses is simple and only takes a few minutes. These MLB sportsbook promos all have similar sign-up procedures along these lines:\\nOk, you have signed up for some of these MLB playoffs betting promos and are ready to make that first bet. If you haven't bet on baseball before, you're in for a treat because there are a million ways to make the best MLB bets today. Because the Dodgers are the betting favorites to win the World Series, let's use them as an example. Of course, you can bet the traditional moneyline, the total or the run line.\\nThe moneyline and totals are self-explanatory, but some bettors may be a bit confused by the run line. Unlike in football and basketball where the spread can range into double digits depending on the strength of the two teams and balances the odds at -110 on both sides, the run line is always set at +1.5 or -1.5 and the odds can vary.\\nThen, depending on which of the nation's best online sportsbooks you're using, you can get as detailed as you like. On BetMGM, you can wager on what happens with Dodgers starter Walker Buehler first pitch (Strike? Ball? In play?) along with a bunch of other signature bets.

Wisconsin Ave., that emphasizes Phillips\\' view of herself as a collaborator. It will include an interactive element for visitors to the plaza.\\nPhiladelphia-based artist Karyn Olivier\\'s \"I Didn\\'t Do It Alone\" draws its title from a statement frequently made by Phillips (1923-2018), a pioneering civil rights activist and public servant. Her many firsts include being the first woman and first Black person on the Milwaukee Common Council, first female judge in Milwaukee County and first Black woman elected to statewide public office in Wisconsin.\\nOlivier\\'s memorial installation will consist of a bronze desk and a bronze chair, flanked by two stone architectural sections with outward-facing sculptural figures. The six figures will represent citizens, activists and leaders who worked with Phillips; their linked arms will evoke the 200 days of open housing marches that Phillips took part in, according to a DCD statement.\\nVisitors will be able to sit at the installation\\'s partners-style desk, according to the department.\\n\"Over time, the natural patina formed by the oils of human touch will become a part of this memorial, mirroring the way Phillips felt the people were always a part of her work,\" according to the DCD statement.\\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\\nAn art committee of curators, artists, collectors, community members and city staff selected Olivier from a pool of 60 projects, including three finalists.

It raised eyebrows when he was added to the postseason roster, and he was retired twice during the 2-0 series loss to the Diamondbacks, drawing boos from home Milwaukee fans.\\nSo surely, there was a little bit of satisfaction when he delivered a two-run triple and then scored to give the Mets a 3-2 lead in Game 1 of the series. He chirped at Brewers shortstop Willy Adames while circling the bases, causing a back-and-forth in which Adames invited Winker to settle their differences in the parking lot (and apparently he wasn\\'t kidding).\\nWinker told the Post he had not spoken to Adames and had no intention to do so.

Hurricane hunters used the plane to collect data from the storm, which quickly became a Category 5 Monday night.\\nOn the same day of the flight, the storm intensified quickly, with sustained winds reaching 180 mph.\\nThe plane, which was made in the mid-1970s, flew into Hurricane Milton to measure several key details about the storm, Susan Buchanan, the National Weather Service\\'s director of public affairs, told USA TODAY in an email.\\n\"The purpose of these missions is primarily to locate the center of the storm and measure central pressure and surface winds around the eye,\" she wrote.\\nThe National Hurricane Center then uses that data to monitor a storm\\'s location, strength, and speed and meteorologists create forecasts about the storms\\' track and intensity based on that information.\\nMiss Piggy is one of two WP-3D Orions. The other is called Kermit, according to NOAA.\\n\"Miss Piggy\" was originally called the \"Pig,\" according to Greg Bast, a production controller and flight engineer at NOAA\\'s Aircraft Operations Center, according to an article published by NOAA. He and another flight engineer, Steve Kirkpatrick, were not \"happy with the appearance\" of the plane and set out to change it between 1990 and 1991.\\n\"We also decided to start calling it \\'\\'Miss Piggy,\\' because the Muppet character is always so fastidious with her appearance,\" he wrote.\\nBast then drew a logo with Miss Piggy on it and he and Kirkpatrick placed it on their desks, tool boxes and in the plane. The name caught on around the office. Soon the plane was dubbed \\'Miss Piggy,\\' and it \"became one of the nicest looking aircraft we had,\" according to Bast.\\nFrith also came up with the idea to name the second plane Kermit since the characters are \"such good friends and the two aircraft are very close.\"\\nIn 1996, NOAA acquired another hurricane research plane, a G-IV, which was named after the Muppet Gonzo.\\nContributing: John Bacon, Trevor Hughes, Dinah Voyles Pulver, USA TODAY; Reuters',\n",

       "   'excerpt': 'While the two have maintained that they had a good working relationship, there were several moments this year that might have painted another picture.',\n",
       "   'summary': 'As it turns out, there was not a lot of gas and plenty of brake during the Robert Saleh era.\\nThe New York Jets stunningly moved on from the head coach after Week 5, ending the brief working relationship between the head coach and Aaron Rodgers, whom the Jets traded for in 2023.\\nRodgers played only four snaps for the Jets last season before injuring his Achilles, leaving some to wonder what the Saleh-Rodgers working relationship would look like when they were all-systems-go. As it turns out, it wasn\\'t pretty: The Jets offense has sputtered this season and New York sits at 2-3 entering a crucial matchup vs. Buffalo in Week 6.\\nWhile there was never true, outward acrimony between the head coach and his future Hall of Fame quarterback, there were a number of instances since the beginning of the year that maybe showed a small bit of a fracture between the player and the coach.\\nHere\\'s what they were:\\nWhile it sounds like a National Lampoon movie, Aaron Rodgers\\' Egypt vacation raised some eyebrows, seemingly including that of the head coach.\\nSaleh\\'s response to Rodgers skipping out on mandatory minicamp was the first sign of trouble in paradise this year. Saleh announced that Rodgers was fined for missing on mandatory minicamp, for an \"inexcused absence.\"\\nWhile Saleh leaned on the CBA as reason for why it was labeled \"inexcused,\" some weren\\'t satisfied with the coach\\'s explanation.\\n\"Selfishly, I want our guys here all the time, but when you get to these mandatory things, you make the best decision for yourself,\" Saleh told reporters at Jets headquarters in Florham Park, New Jersey. \"Obviously, selfishly, want all of the team here all the time. But he made a decision, and that\\'s where he went.\"\\nRodgers would later downplay any notions that he and the head coach were split over the decision for his to make his trip. Still, it was a few weeks of headlines and distractions that, potentially, could have been avoided.\\nIf there was ever an exemplary moment of the Rodgers-Saleh relationship not being rosy, this was it. And it happened on national TV, too.\\nFollowing a scoring play during a \"Thursday Night Football\" matchup between the New England Patriots and the Jets, Saleh went in for a hug for Rodgers, which the quarterback turned away in an awkward moment.\\nBoth would, again, downplay the incident following the game. Still, it was a confusing bit of chemistry – or lack thereof – between the coach and the player.\\n\"He\\'s not a big hugger,\" Rodgers told reporters. \"I didn\\'t know he was going for a hug.\"\\nBoth offered somewhat confusing explanations for the moment, including something about the Jets needing to go up a few scores. Still, it was more than a little weird.\\nThe most recent example of a potential disconnect between the two sides happened after the Jets\\' disastrous Week 4 loss to the Denver Broncos, during which they scored just nine points and committed a bevy of penalties on the offensive side of the ball.\\nA decent amount of those penalties came pre-snap, with several false starts coming on Rodgers\\' signature hard count cadence. Following the game, Saleh made it clear that, perhaps the Jets aren\\'t jelling well enough to utilize the tool.\\n\"We\\'ve got to figure it out,\" Saleh said following the game. \"Whether or not we\\'re good enough or ready to handle all the cadence. Cadence had not been an issue all camp. Felt like our operation had been operating pretty good. Obviously, today, it took a major step back.\"\\nRodgers took issue with Saleh saying that the cadence was potentially an issue, explaining that toning back on the cadence issue was only one solution. The other: Hold players accountable for their mistakes.\\n\"That\\'s one way to do it,\" Rodgers said. \"The other way is to hold them accountable. We haven\\'t had an issue. … It\\'s been a weapon. We use it every day in practice. We rarely have a false start, and to have five today, it seemed like, four or five, it seems like an outlier. I don\\'t know if we need to make mass changes based on kind of an outlier game.\"',\n",

Greg Abbott made the announcement Friday, adding that 33-year-old Seth Altman is now on the Texas Department of Public Safety\\'s 10 Most Wanted Fugitive List.\\nAltman is now wanted for attempted capital murder of a peace officer after he reportedly shot at Rex Plant, Police Chief in Memphis, about 86 miles southeast of Amarillo.\\nAround 10:50 p.m. Chief Plant and another officer were attempting to serve an arrest warrant on Altman for burglary, the Texas Department of Public Safety told the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal, part of the USA TODAY network.\\nWhile they were trying to serve the warrant, Altman pulled out a gun, fired multiple times and shot Plant. The suspect fled the scene on foot and Plant was taken to a hospital in Lubbock, Gov. Abbott said in his statement.\\nAccording to the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal, Altman was last seen in the 200 block of South Fourth Street in Memphis around 11 p.m. Thursday. He was wearing a blue T-shirt and blue jeans.\\nGov. Abbott said the suspect is 6-feet-2 inches tall and weighs 220 pounds. He has blue eyes and red or auburn hair and \\'should be considered armed and dangerous.\\'\\nThe morning after the shooting, the Texas Department of Public Safety issued a Blue Alert for Altman. Blue Alerts are issued when someone is involved in the killing or serious injury of a law enforcement officer, according to the department.\\nWhen the Blue Alert for Altman went off in the early hours of Friday morning, Texans took to social media to post about it. The Montgomery County Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Management shared Altman\\'s photos and commented as well.\\nCalling Altman \\'the scumbag who is wanted in connection with an assault on a police officer,\\' the office posted his photo. The office also said there is no word on the police chief\\'s condition.\\nA woman claiming to be a relative of the chief shared on Facebook Friday night that Plant had undergone surgery and would require more.\\n\\'Please pray for him and the family,\\' the woman wrote. \\'Pray that they catch the man that shot him.\\'\\nRead more:Blue alert issued in Hall County, Texas for man suspected of injuring police officer\\nGov.

Other Charged Lemonade cases represented by the firm are still pending, she said.\\nThe settlement, first reported by NBC News, is the first to come out of several similar lawsuits lodged against the eatery. The family of Katz, a 21-year-old Ivy League college student with a heart condition who died after drinking one of the lemonades, was the first of several to file such legal actions.\\nOther outstanding lawsuits linked the lemonade drink, which contained 390 mg of caffeine in a large, to the death of Dennis Brown, 46, of Fleming Island, Florida and to the \"permanent\" injury alleged by 28-year-old Lauren Skerritt of Rhode Island.\\nPanera initially added a warning label to the drinks but has since removed the lemonade from stores nationwide, citing not the incidents but a \"menu transformation.\\'\\nPanera Bread did not immediately respond to request for comment Monday morning.\\nOn Sept. 10, 2022, Sarah Katz, a 21-year-old University of Pennsylvania student, drank a Charged Lemonade at a local Panera Bread. Having been diagnosed at a young age with a heart condition called QT syndrome type 1, Katz avoided energy drinks, according to the lawsuit filed later by her family.\\nAn avid Gatorade drinker, Katz\\'s family believes she saw the \"charged\" in \"Charged Lemonade\" as referring to electrolytes, similar to Gatorade\\'s marketing, and claims she saw no signs indicating the drinks had a high caffeine content. Using her Unlimited Sip Club membership, which allows you to fill your drink cup without additional cost, Katz got the drink.\\nHours later, she collapsed and fell into cardiac arrest. She was transported to a hospital where she went into another arrest and died.\\nIn a statement to USA TODAY at the time, a Panera spokesperson said: \\'We were very saddened to learn this morning about the tragic passing of Sarah Katz, and our hearts go out to her family. At Panera, we strongly believe in transparency around our ingredients. We will work quickly to thoroughly investigate this matter.\\'\\nSarah Katz\\'s family filed a lawsuit against Panera Bread in the court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia County for wrongful death on Oct. 23, 2023.\\nThe lawsuit alleged Katz went into cardiac arrest as a direct result of consuming a Charged Lemonade drink. According to court documents, a large Charged Lemonade has 390 mg of caffeine in it, far more than what can be found in drinks like Monster or Red Bull, but was advertised improperly as a \"clean\" drink with the same amount of caffeine \"as a dark roast coffee.\"\\nKatz drank the beverage \"reasonably confident it was a traditional lemonade and/or electrolyte sports drink containing a reasonable amount of caffeine safe for her to drink,\" the lawsuit said.',\n",

'A lot of guys got a lot of action. A lot of guys stepped up after watching the film. Really it was an impressive day and a day we needed in a lot of different ways.'\\nHere are the highlights from Fickell's 22-minute chat with reporters.`\\nFreshman Kevin Heywood's performance held up on film.\\nFickell was initially impressed with the job of the freshman tackle during the second half Saturday. Heywood played most of the final two quarters at left tackle after Jack Nelson experienced a minor injury.\\nWatching the film confirmed Fickell's thinking.\\n'It put him in a situation where he had to play,' Fickell said of Nelson's injury. 'It wasn't a situation where we were just going to run the football (or) we're going to do the things we did on the first day or second day of spring ball. It was like, 'Look, we're still in a battle here, we've got to see what you've got.''\\nMore:Putting Wisconsin football's win over Purdue into perspective. What should the Badgers be encouraged about?\\nTyler Van Dyke's season-ending knee injury didn't just open the door for Braedyn Locke but also for freshman quarterback Mabrey Mettauer, who has been elevated to top backup.\\nThe change means an increased mental workload for the 6-foot-4, 230-pounder from Texas. He wasn't getting nearly as deep into the playbook running the third team.\\nFickell said Mettauer has adjusted well to his enhanced role.\\n'The tough situation for him is those guys were battling in front of him,' Fickell said. 'He wasn't even getting many opportunities to run with the 2s. He probably had a handful of snaps in all of fall camp with the 2s.\\n'And it's hard to learn. Not that it's hard to learn playing with the third group, but even for me I'd say I don't want the third group doing a whole lot. I want to see those guys just play.'\\nThe injury bug spread through the receiver corps Saturday. Starters Bryson Green and Will Pauling as well as punt returner Tyrell Henry didn't finish the game due to lower body injuries.\\nPauling and Green rank 1-2 on the team in receptions.\\nFickell said none of those players did much during the team's Sunday workout but wouldn't speculate on what the rest of the week might bring.\\n'If they're not able to practice it's hard to think they'll be able to perform in a game,' Fickell said. 'And at that position in particular, there are a lot of things that go into a week. It's early yet. We'll find out where they are on Tuesday.'\\nBefore running back Chez Mellusi decided to take a leave from the team to focus on getting his body healthy, he and Fickell spoke extensively. .\\nFickell explained that it's difficult when an athlete's mind and body aren't aligned.\\n'We all that played the game have this expectation,' Fickell said. 'Your mind and body have an idea of how you want to play. Sometimes you can't do it because the opportunities aren't there and then sometimes deep down inside the health and things aren't there.'\\nFickell said he and Mellusi will continue to keep in contact.\",\n",

       "   'summary': 'A new report reveals a teen driver\\'s response to viewing dashcam footage of a September 2023 crash that resulted in a chemical spill and five fatalities.\\nThe incident occurred on Highway 40 near Teutopolis, a village in Effingham County, Illinois, according to a summary report from the National Transportation Safety Board. The driver of a Toyota minivan passed a tanker truck while both were traveling west on the highway.\\n\"The passing maneuver was being conducted in a no passing zone and in the presence of oncoming traffic,\" the summary states. The tanker truck \"moved to the right to allow the Toyota minivan to complete its passing maneuver.\"\\nThe moment was captured on dashcam footage included in the investigation. According to the report, it resulted in the tanker truck − which contained an estimated 7,600 gallons of anhydrous ammonia −ultimately striking a utility trailer parked on private property. The chemical was released into the area.\\nPer the NTSB, five people succumbed to chemical exposure, including three people at a nearby home and two other drivers. In addition, eight people were also hospitalized, and four others had \"minor exposure injuries.\" Hundreds of people were ordered to evacuate.\\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the chemical is utilized as a fertilizer in agriculture, manufacturing, and refrigeration. Exposure can be deadly.\\nAccidents:Girl, 2, drowns during field trip to West Virginia resort: Reports\\nIllinois State Police troopers interviewed the 17-year-old minivan motorist in October 2023. During the probe, they showed the teen the dashcam video.\\n\"Oh, my goodness. Yep, totally my bad. Wow,\" the teen stated to police. \"Holy (expletive).\"\\nWhen asked to watch the footage again, the teen refused, adding: \"I\\'ve honestly in the past had times when I just don\\'t use good judgment in judging like distances and whether I have enough time for something. So it doesn\\'t shock me, but obviously like the consequences of this like are no joke.\"One of the troopers asked if the teen knew about the incident.\\n\"Of course not. I told you that like three times. I had no idea. I thought -- generally you would think, right, if you\\'re going along a road you would know if a truck flips behind you. There was nothing like audible,\" the teen responded.\\nIn the interview, the teen, an Ohio resident, explained that she was in the car with her mother and her brother, visiting her mother\\'s boyfriend in Illinois. The minor\\'s identity was not revealed in the documents.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'Hezbollah rockets wounded at least 10 in Haifa, Israel\\'s third-largest city, as Israel hammered Beirut with overnight airstrikes on the eve of Oct. 7, one year after the Hamas attack that triggered an escalating crisis in the Middle East.\\nHezbollah fired off a missile salvo toward a military base south of the city on Israel\\'s western coast, followed by a second one that it said targeted an area north of the city.\\nThe Israeli military said it intercepted five rockets fired from Lebanon and was reviewing the incident. It also downed some of the 15 projectiles it said were fired toward Tiberias, around 40 miles east of Haifa near the Golan Heights.\\nMeanwhile, Israel fired missiles at the southern suburbs of Beirut, the Lebanese capital where Hezbollah is headquartered. For more than two weeks, Israel has launched a wave of aerial attacks at the city, killing more than 1,500 people.\\nMore:A year after the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks on Israel, 4 Americans are still being held hostage\\nThe rockets across the Israel-Lebanon border came hours before the 1-year anniversary of Oct. 7, when Hamas overran Gaza\\'s border, killing 1,200 Israelis and taking 251 people hostage, marking the largest escalation in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in decades. It was the biggest attack on Jews since the Holocaust and the deadliest day in Israel\\'s history.\\nIsrael launched an aerial and ground siege of Gaza to root out Hamas, a war that has killed nearly 42,000 people, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. Airstrikes have pulverized the densely populated enclave, destroying infrastructure and pushing those remaining to the brink of starvation.\\nAmid the worsening situation in Beirut, the U.S. facilitated a flight carrying around 90 people from the city to Istanbul on Sunday, according to a spokesperson from the State Department.\\nThe ongoing siege has provoked heightened attacks on Israel from Hamas\\' allies in the region, including Hezbollah. The Lebanese military group, which functions as a \"state within a state\" in the country and maintains its own fighting force, has lobbed rockets over the border into northern Israel on a near-daily basis since the conflict began.\\nIsrael began a wave of airstrikes targeting the group after thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies exploded across the country on Sept. 17 and 18. Last week, Israeli soldiers invaded Lebanon for the first time since 2006, in what Israel called a limited operation on Hezbollah command posts. More than 1.2 million people in Lebanon have been displaced amid the fighting.\\nFor almost a year, the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah has intensified firing of rockets into northern Israel. Tensions on that border have increased since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on Israel.\\nU.S. officials are concerned that a ratcheting up of tensions could lead to a broader regional conflict in the Middle East and have been trying to negotiate a cease-fire.\\nMore:Murder for hire: Inside Iran\\'s proxy war with Israel in the West\\nIsraelis gathered for solemn memorials of the anniversary of the October attack on Monday. As sirens sounded across Tel Aviv after Hamas said it fired a missile salvo at the city, people at a memorial ceremony formed a long line along a busy street, holding hands.\\nA crowd of around 300 held a minute of silence outside the house of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as they carried photos of the dozens of Israelis still held hostage.\\nIsraeli President Isaac Herzog led a ceremony in Re\\'im, the site of the Nova Music Festival, where more than 360 people were killed and many were kidnapped as Hamas fighters swept into the desert festival during the attack.',\n",

The 10-year-old beams with pride as he shows off the finishing touches his dad, Teon Hollins, put on Princeton\\'s new business venture.\\nPrinceton, a student at Garden Homes Lutheran School, points to the yellow custom-made countertops with drip paint detailing.\\n\\'And then in these cabinets, I have my cotton candy machine ...,\\' Princeton said. \\'And here are water tanks for storage. And then I have my refrigerator. And in the far corner is my sinks — wash, rinse, sanitize and another for handwashing.\\'\\nPrinceton has been selling his homemade lemonade the last two years from a 3x7 wooden stand his father built. Business has been brisk since he sold out of his fruit-flavored drinks at this year\\'s Juneteenth Parade.\\nBut an upgrade was needed. Princeton\\'s Phresh Lemonade — a portmanteau of the initials of his first and last name — went from lemonade stand to a food trailer.\\nNow he has a vision of franchising Phresh Lemonade with a fleet of trailers. His business plan is simple: Branch out to areas with hot climates like Houston, Arizona and Las Vegas.\\n\\'It is the most popular thing to sell in the summer,\\' Princeton said.\\nHis decision to branch out was recognizing not only his business potential but his own potential.\\n\\'I got more confident in myself and that I could keep selling it,\\' said Princeton, who considers himself a somewhat shy person.\\nHe began selling his lemonade at his father\\'s adult kickball games at Beckum Park. But the business grew out of a lesson his father wanted to impart to his son.\\n\\'Typically, kids always want parents to buy or parents to give,\\' said the elder Hollins.\\nHe wanted his son \\'to figure out a way to make your own money.\\' He also wanted to teach his son financial responsibility, the value of work and earning a dollar.\\n\\'It is great to start them off young … so he can understand what it takes to keep a business going, how to expand, how to make your business better,\" Teon Hollins said. \"That\\'s our goal — how to make Phresh Lemonade better.\"\\nPrinceton took cues from his dad, an entrepreneur already. Teon is a tattoo artist and operates a mobile tattoo parlor, called Shorty\\'s Mobile Experience, out of a converted shuttle bus.\\nHe found the trailer for Princeton on Facebook Marketplace in July and did most of the buildout of the trailer, which recently passed licensing and inspections.\\n\\'Lemonade is always a kid-friendly type of fun business to do,\\' Teon Hollins said. \\'It was a success ever since we started.\\'\\nPrinceton didn\\'t want to sell just the traditional lemonade. He wanted to be different. So he began experimenting with flavors like passion fruit, peach, raspberry and blueberry. Phresh Lemonade has a variety of flavors — all made with fresh fruit. It sells in 16-ounce containers for about $8.\\nPrinceton wanted to expand on the traditional flavor to cater to different tastes. Customers can customize flavors. But strawberry is the best seller.\\nThe lemonade trailer was the next evolution of his business. Princeton knew he needed to expand from his Juneteenth experience. He brought 120 bottles of his homemade lemonade and sold out before noon.\\nNow with the lemonade trailer, Princeton can meet demand. He can prep and make his fresh lemonade on the spot. And the trailer provides more countertop space to explore other menu items.\\nAlso, the trailer allows the duo to sell at more events, something they missed out on with just the lemonade stand. Summer is over, but both father and son hope to hit some youth football games and other outdoor events before the weather gets too cold.\\nWhat started as a lesson to teach financial responsibility has turned into a family-oriented business. And Princeton is already planning his next business venture — a clothing or streetwear apparel brand.',\n",

       "   'summary': \"In this week's Milwaukee-area high school girls volleyball rankings, two-time defending Division 1 state champion Divine Savior Holy Angels saw another historic winning streak ended in the Chicagoland area for the second straight season, while some shuffling of programs ensued behind the Dashers.\\nHere's a look at the new area rankings as the regular season enters its final couple of weeks, starting with the Dashers at No. 1 and a reshuffling of the top five on down to Living Word Lutheran, which lost its first match since August this past weekend in tournament play.\\nTeam (W-L), last week\\nOthers considered: Brookfield East (22-7), Grafton (23-7), Kewaskum (18-8), New Berlin Eisenhower (26-8), New Berlin West (17-7), Oak Creek (17-10), Pewaukee (23-10), Saint Thomas More (19-7), Wauwatosa East (15-11), West Bend West (17-15).\\nOne of the sleeper teams in the area might be waking up some folks down the stretch of the season. When you're among the likes of state qualifiers like DSHA and Sussex Hamilton in the Greater Metro Conference, a program like Brookfield East can almost get lost in the array of talent that is the greater Milwaukee area for girls volleyball. The Spartans have hit a nice stride in the last couple weeks, winning seven of their last eight matches, including a three-set tournament victory over No. 9 Franklin last weekend. They swept West Allis Hale in GMC action mid-week and then went 4-0 in tournament play to take home this week's team of the week honors.\\nIf you don't know the name Natalie Surges, you do now. The Princeton recruit is only a junior, but has been one of the leading kill specialists around the area with 278 kills in 71 total sets played this season. She's one of four Spartans with at least 117 kills and trails only teammate Amorina Compean-Costello (285) for the leading dig total on the season with 212. Her 33 total aces also trail only Hailey Schneiker's 38 aces for the team lead.\\nThe Spartans are in a rugged sectional come playoff time with the likes of Arrowhead, Sussex Hamilton and 2023 Division 2 state qualifier Pewaukee, but keep tabs on this bunch. They could be an interesting team to watch once the brackets are made official.\\n(All matches are scheduled for Tuesday unless otherwise noted.)\\nOconomowoc at Arrowhead, 6:30 p.m.: You could make the case that this is the match of the week. With Catholic Memorial's hard-fought five-set win over Arrowhead last week, the Warhawks need a win here and help elsewhere to keep their Classic 8 title chances alive. However, the same could be said for defending champion Oconomowoc. If the Raccoons go on the road and pick up a huge victory here, winning out and at least one CMH loss seals no worse than a split of the title for them. This should be a great one.\\nWatertown Luther Prep at Lake Country Lutheran, 6:45 p.m.: This is a huge week in the Midwest Classic title chase. The Phoenix head to face the Lightning in a crucial matchup for both programs, who currently sit with Living Word Lutheran atop the standings at 4-0 in MCC play. The Lightning have a matchup Thursday with LWL that could be for the outright conference lead, but WLP can throw a wrench into matters with a win here Tuesday and launch itself right into the thick of the title finish.\\nDSHA at Brookfield East, 7 p.m.: The Dashers' 46-match winning streak ended in out-of-state action once again, but there's still much to play for as they chase a third straight state title later this fall. They're also chasing another GMC title, which continues with a fun matchup here against a hot Spartans side that took home team of the week honors this week. It's DSHA's conference title to lose with a huge win last week against Sussex Hamilton, but you can't count chickens before they hatch. This could be a tricky spot for the Dashers.\\nMilwaukee high school football rankings: Homestead's big win over North Shore rival earns it top 5 spot in Milwaukee area high school football rankings\\nWauwatosa East at Menomonee Falls, 7 p.m.: The top half of the Greater Metro Conference is stacked and that's not even including an improving Wauwatosa East bunch with 15 wins this season. Menomonee Falls has been a tough team to handle this season. Its GMC title hopes aren't completely gone − similarly to Brookfield East and Sussex Hamilton − but it's a tough ask to get help in the form of a DSHA loss or two down the stretch. Still, Falls will definitely be a contender to make it to the Resch Center in November, but matches like this will give it a good mental test.\",\n",

It's a different process than mail-in absentee voting, where a voter requests and receives an absentee ballot in the mail.\\nYou might hear both referred to as early voting, because it takes place before Election Day. If you received an absentee ballot in the mail, one of your options for returning it is bringing your ballot to an early voting site.\\nVoters in Wisconsin can still register to vote and cast ballots at the polls from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Nov. 5. But some voters may prefer to use early voting sites, especially if they will be busy or out of town on Election Day.\\nHere's what to know about early voting in Wisconsin for the November election:\\nUnder state law, clerks can offer early voting no earlier than 14 days before Election Day and no later than the Sunday before the election. There is no in-person absentee voting on the Monday before the election.\\nIn the case of the Nov. 5 election, that early voting window is Oct. 22 to Nov. 3.\\nMore:Wisconsin election dates: Early voting, absentee requests, online registration deadline\\nMore:Eric Hovde says early voting starts before his one debate with Tammy Baldwin. Is he right?\\nIt's up to each city, town or village to set the dates, times and locations they want to offer early voting. Your clerk may have entered that information into myvote.wi.gov, so that's a good place to check first by entering your address.\\nYou can also check your local clerk's website for more information or give them a call to ask about early voting options. You can find your clerk's contact information at myvote.wi.gov.\\nUnlike polling places, which are assigned based on your address, you can visit any of the in-person absentee voting sites your city, town or village offers.\\nYou should bring the same documents that you would bring to vote at the polls. That includes a photo ID, and proof of residence if you need to register or re-register to vote. You can find more information about documents you need to register to vote here.\\nMore:Attending college in Wisconsin and unsure how to vote?

       "   'excerpt': 'In its 107-year history, the University of Wisconsin-Madison football stadium has hosted very few major concerts. That may be changing.',\n",
       "   'summary': 'There\\'s no bigger potential venue for a concert in Wisconsin than Camp Randall Stadium.\\nBut in its 107-year history, the University of Wisconsin-Madison football stadium has hosted very few major concerts.\\nThat may be changing.\\nOn Tuesday, Coldplay announced that it\\'s bringing its \"Music of the Spheres World Tour\" — the highest-grossing and bestselling rock tour ever, according to Billboard — to the home of the Wisconsin Badgers on July 19, 2025.\\nThe British rock band\\'s first Wisconsin concert since 2009 will be Camp Randall\\'s first concert since 1997, when the Rolling Stones stopped there for their \"Bridges to Babylon Tour.\"\\nWisconsin music fans probably won\\'t have to wait another three decades for the next one, said Charlie Goldstone, co-president of Madison-based venue operator and concert promoter FPC Live, which is putting on the Coldplay concert.\\n\"Coldplay is not the only artist we\\'re in conversations with about playing Camp Randall,\" Goldstone told the Journal Sentinel. \"There\\'s a lot of interest. I would expect this to be the first of many.\"\\nCamp Randall hosted its first major concert in 1988 with Pink Floyd, who came back in 1994. The Stones also played their twice, including in 1994, as did U2, in 1992 and 1997. Genesis also headlined the stadium in 1992.\\nBut that\\'s it.\\nTours like Coldplay\\'s, primarily designed and staged for football stadiums, historically have hit larger markets, like Chicago and Minneapolis, which also draw fans from Wisconsin.\\nLambeau Field has hosted some huge concerts, too, including Kenny Chesney with Jason Aldean in 2015 and Paul McCartney in 2019. But it\\'s trickier staging a concert at the home of the Green Bay Packers.\\n\"We only have a six-week period from late May through June where we can hold concerts before our field is completely closed so we can focus on football and growing out the grass,\" Gabrielle Dow, vice president of marketing and fan engagement for the Green Bay Packers, told the Journal Sentinel in 2019. \"All the stars have to align for a stadium tour to stop in Green Bay.\"\\nCamp Randall, on the other hand, uses turf, so there\\'s \"not as much sensitivity … and a much bigger window for shows,\" Goldstone said.\\nMore tickets also can be sold for a concert at Camp Randall than at Lambeau, too, said FPC Live Co-President Scott Leslie.\\n\"The stage faces the club seats at Lambeau,\" he explained. \"(At Camp Randall,) the stage faces the student section, so you\\'re gaining that capacity.\"\\nSerious discussions with UW-Madison about bringing concerts back to Camp Randall started in the past year or two, Goldstone said. Coldplay, trying to expand territory for its third run through the States on what will be a four-year \"Spheres\" tour, provided a golden opportunity — one that seemed to inspire the band to hold its world premiere listening event for its new album, \"Moon Music,\" at the Moon Saloon in Moon, Wisconsin, last week.\\n\"They haven\\'t been to the state in 16 years,\" Goldstone said. \"They have never been to Madison specifically. … Camp Randall is a very special place to a lot of people. It holds massive games routinely every year and brings people together. That is appealing to a band like Coldplay. … It checks all the boxes they wanted.\"\\n\"The right situation has to come along,\" Leslie said. \"I don\\'t think it\\'s in anybody\\'s best interest to open up a stadium like Camp Randall for a concert and have (only) 30,000 people show up. There aren\\'t many Coldplays in the world. That is one of the biggest bands on the planet, and we\\'re talking about a facility that\\'s the largest in the state of Wisconsin.\"\\nOther circumstances have developed to make the timing right for FPC Live to stage huge stadium concerts in the company\\'s hometown.\\nIn 2018, Live Nation, by far the largest player in the live music industry, bought a majority stake in FPC Live\\'s parent company, Frank Productions. As a result, FPC Live has served as the Wisconsin promoter for major Live Nation concerts at Wisconsin venues including American Family Field, the American Family Insurance Amphitheater, Fiserv Forum (all in Milwaukee) and Breese Stevens Field in Madison. Concert numbers at all of those venues, where FPC Live is the primary promoter, have grown drastically.\\nAnd FPC Live overall has grown significantly. It sold 1.4 million concert tickets last year that, collectively, earned $108.4 million, ranking FPC Live 24th on concert trade publication Pollstar\\'s list of worldwide promoters by gross. And construction is underway for FPC Live\\'s $65 million, 4,500-person capacity ballroom-style music venue in Milwaukee\\'s Deer District.\\nSince the Live Nation deal, FPC Live also has become the dominant concert player in its hometown, especially with its built-from-scratch club the Sylvee, allowing for Madison as a live music market to \"punch above its weight class,\" Leslie said.\\nAnd the fact that Madison is \"a city that is growing extremely rapidly\" helped make the Coldplay booking possible, he suggested.\\nAll of these factors have \"given everybody the confidence to move forward with a show this big,\" Goldstone said.\\nBut perhaps the most crucial development that cold boost Camp Randall concert bookings: The number of stadium tours has surged post-pandemic. Grosses from the world\\'s top 100 stadiums for concerts were up 35% in 2023 to $3.62 billion, according to Pollstar. The number of tickets sold for those tours also increased 22.2%, to 29.1 million.\\n\"The financial incentives are obvious,\" Dave Brooks, senior director of live and touring for Billboard, told the Journal Sentinel earlier this year. \"You can get a much larger audience for the fraction of the price it costs you to do multiple arena shows. The costs are somewhat higher for a stadium concert than an arena show, but the increase in attendance is like double depending on how big the stadium is, and you can make almost double the money.\"\\nThat\\'s a key reason why American Family Field — which like Camp Randall, had its own stadium tour drought, from 2004 to 2013 (excluding one-offs like Farm Aid in 2010 and Harley-Davidson and Miller Brewing bashes) — had a record number of concerts in 2023 with four shows, which the Milwaukee Brewers stadium matched again in 2024. Jason Hartlund, who oversees concerts at the stadium as executive vice president-chief commercial officer, told the Journal Sentinel in April he expects the Brewers ballpark going forward to host four to six concerts a year.\\nThat bodes well for Camp Randall\\'s concert prospects.\\n\"There are more stadium-level headliners than ever before,\" Goldstone said. \"2025 will be a big year for that. It makes all the sense in the world for venues like Camp Randall to want to take advantage.\"\\nColdplay brings its \"Music of the Spheres World Tour\" to Camp Randall Stadium on Saturday, July 19, 2025. Tickets go on sale to the general public at noon Central Time through ticketmaster.com. Fans can sign up for artist presale access through coldplay.com until 9 a.m. Central Time Thursday. The presale begins at 9 a.m. Friday. A limited number of $20 tickets will go on sale at noon Nov. 22 through Ticketmaster. Prices for other tickets have yet to be announced.',\n",

Trump also tripled his margin of victory in Florida in 2020.\\nThe latest USA TODAY/Suffolk University poll in the state showed him ahead of Harris by 5 percentage points, within the poll\\'s margin of error, meaning the gap could be wider or could be even smaller.\\nStill, the story of Florida\\'s rightward shift is one of a changing GOP that appeals to the type of voters, either newcomers or long-timers, who typically support Trump.\\nIt\\'s also a story of a state Democratic Party that completely collapsed and is struggling to find a way forward in the epicenter of MAGA America.\\n\\'Personally, I think you have to say we\\'re a leaning red state ‒ at least that,\" said former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Alex Sink. \"The question mark is: Are we a red state?\\'\\nWhile the big GOP victories in Florida over the past two election cycles have attracted attention, the state has been trending red for decades.\\nA Democrat hasn\\'t held the governor\\'s mansion since 1998 – 26 years ago.\\nBoth chambers of the Florida Legislature have long been controlled by Republicans.\\nDemocrats managed to pull off some big wins over the past 20 years that made the state seem more competitive, though. And most statewide races have been extremely close in recent decades.\\nBarack Obama carried Florida in both 2008 and 2012.\\nDemocrat Bill Nelson represented Florida in the U.S. Senate from 2001 to 2019, and Democrats also held lesser statewide offices.\\nSink won a statewide campaign for chief financial officer in 2006 and then ran for governor in 2010, losing by just a single percentage point.\\nIt was the beginning of an incredible run of tight races in Florida, with every contest for governor and president decided by a percentage point or less between 2010 and 2018, when DeSantis was elected by the closest margin of any governor in Florida\\'s history.\\nDuring that period, Florida Democrats had a sizeable voter registration advantage over Republicans and they still came up short in most races.\\nThe situation is now reversed, and the GOP has one million more registered voters in Florida than Democrats out of 13.5 million total voters. It\\'s an \\'incredibly\\' daunting figure, Sink said.\\n\\'I mean, you can only overcome so much,\\' she added.\\nSink believes Democrats made strategic blunders in not prioritizing voter registration, including during the COVID-19 pandemic when the party stopped going door-to-door and the GOP did not.\\n\\'It was a huge mistake,\\' she said.\\nShe also sees other factors at play in Florida\\'s rightward shift, though. It coincided with the pandemic, and DeSantis\\' push to keep schools and businesses open after brief shutdowns early on.\\nDeSantis touted the \\'Free State of Florida.\\' His management of the state during the pandemic has been mythologized by conservatives, who often claim that his policies lured more right-leaning voters to the state in search of freedom.\\n\\'From 2020 to 2022 if … you were COVID scared you didn\\'t move to the state of Florida, we were the Wild West,\\' said Ryan Tyson, a leading GOP pollster and political consultant who has worked with DeSantis.\\nThere is some data to support this.\\nData from the University of Florida\\'s Bureau of Economic and Business Research shows Florida added 1.1 million people between 2020 and 2023 as the state, long a magnet for population growth, attracted many Baby Boomer retirees and the workers needed to service them.\\nThe state also drew a new population of migrants – people who could work remotely and live anywhere thanks to pandemic-induced changes to business operations.\\nThis surge of new residents has been weighted more toward the GOP.\\nBetween Jan. 1, 2020, and Aug. 1 of this year, 666,525 people who were registered to vote in another state moved to Florida and registered to vote, according to data provided by L2, a company that analyzes voter and consumer data. Of those movers, 331,646 are Republicans, compared with 156,922 Democrats and 177,957 nonpartisan voters.\\n\\'Florida has gotten more Republican – anyone who says otherwise isn\\'t being honest,\\' Steve Schale, a Florida-based political operative who ran Obama\\'s campaign in the state in 2008, wrote on his blog recently.\\nSome of these voters were at least partially drawn by DeSantis\\' policies.\\n\\'It wasn\\'t the determining factor, but it made the decision easier,\\' Reyna said of DeSantis\\' approach to COVID, which also is one reason he cast his ballot for the governor in 2022.\\nSink recalled sitting near two couples at a restaurant and overhearing two men talking to each other.\\n\\'The guy said to the other guy: \\'We moved here from Ohio because we like Ron DeSantis,\\'\\' Sink said.\\nHow many voters were drawn by DeSantis\\' policies isn\\'t clear, though. And having 174,724 more Republicans than Democrats moving to the state since 2020 doesn\\'t explain how DeSantis won by 1.5 million votes.\\n\\'There are undoubtedly people who moved here because they appreciate the governor\\'s policies related to COVID, that is undeniably true,\\' Wagner said. \\'But Florida\\'s a very big state with millions of voters and one does not win by 19 points based on people who moved to the state.\\'\\nDeSantis won over groups of voters who historically have supported Democrats, including women and Hispanics. That helped him flip two counties – Miami-Dade and Palm Beach – that have long been Democratic strongholds.\\nMiami-Dade is the nation\\'s largest Hispanic majority county.\\nFlorida\\'s Hispanic vote is pivotal.\\n\\'We are increasingly becoming a Hispanic state,\\' said Christopher McCarty, director of the Bureau of Economic and Business Research at the University of Florida.\\nHispanics made up 26.8% of Florida\\'s population in 2020 but are projected to be 28.2% of residents next year, according to BEBR, an increase of 772,000 people.\\nMany Florida Hispanics trace their roots back to South America and Central America instead of Mexico, and they often are more conservative than the nation\\'s Hispanic population as a whole. In recent years there has been a large influx of Venezuelans fleeing that country\\'s oppressive socialist dictator.\\nMany of these voters are staunchly anti-socialist and view the Democratic Party as more sympathetic to socialist views, McCarty said.\\nReyna said his family was \\'blacklisted\\' from visiting Panama at one point by the regime of military dictator Manuel Noriega. The high school he attended was predominantly Cuban Americans and most of the students were the children of people who fled repressive socialist leader Fidel Castro\\'s regime, he said.\\n\\'You can\\'t swing a dead cat in South Florida and not hit somebody who has a story similar to this,\\' said Reyna, a Republican who plans to vote for Trump this year.\\nSome see the Florida GOP\\'s increasing success with Hispanics and other groups as part of a larger, nationwide political realignment, though.\\n\\'I\\'d argue at least some, if not most of that is due to national trends that play themselves out here,\" Schale wrote of Florida becoming more red. \"Republicans have made gains with Hispanics – they have made gains with Black Men – and they have made gains with non-college white voters ‒ and Florida is home to large, and growing populations of all the above.\\'\\nUnderlying this realignment is the GOP\\'s increasing success with working-class voters of all races under Trump, who has combined a populist economic message with aggressive anti-immigrant rhetoric, a mix of hot-button cultural issues and some unorthodox views for a Republican, such as supporting recreational marijuana legalization in Florida.\\nRepublicans have leaned on these issues to attract more voters without a college degree, while Democrats are winning college-educated voters. Florida\\'s median household income in 2022 was $69,303, according to census data, which is below five of the seven states considered key battlegrounds this cycle.\\nFlorida\\'s economy still largely is based on lower-wage service sector jobs that often do not require a degree. Some higher-wage remote workers have been relocating to Florida since the pandemic, but it hasn\\'t been enough to significantly change the state\\'s workforce, McCarty said.\\n\\'We\\'ve got a long way to go to really make a huge dent in converting our business model from what it\\'s been,\\' he said.\\nAs Florida\\'s demographic and economic profiles increasingly seem to favor the GOP, it could be difficult for Democrats to compete.\\nThe 2024 election could be especially pivotal.\\nAnother big Republican victory could discourage national Democrats from investing in the state going forward, Sink said, making it extremely difficult for the state party to mount the intensive voter registration, persuasion and turnout operation needed to be competitive.\\n\\'This particular election is going to tell us a lot about who we are as Floridians,\\' she said. \\'A lot. This is the year we\\'ll know.\"\\nLeading Florida Democrats have been sounding a hopeful message, dismissing past election results as the product of an unusual confluence of circumstances.\\nThey note that Democrats simply didn\\'t turn out to vote in large enough numbers in 2022, when DeSantis won in a landslide.\\nGOP turnout that year was 67%, while Democratic turnout was just 52%. That means Republicans made up 46% of those casting ballots in the election, according to an analysis by Florida State University\\'s LeRoy Collins Institute, despite comprising just 36% of the electorate.\\n\\'This was a failure by Democrats to motivate our base, the party completely collapsed,\\' said Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried.\\nNow Fried is tasked with rebuilding the party. She has the distinction of being the last Democrat to hold statewide elected office in Florida, having won the race for agriculture commissioner in 2018.\\nFried argues DeSantis went too far right and has prompted a backlash, pointing to Democratic victories in Duval and Miami-Dade mayoral races, DeSantis-backed school board candidates losing this year and a successful signature drive to get a constitutional amendment on the ballot this year that would overturn the six-week abortion ban signed into law by the governor.\\n\\'He took the state in such an extreme direction in 2023 and now you\\'re seeing that pendulum swing back,\\' Fried said.\\nGOP leaders are confident the state will stay red.\\n\\'Nobody is fired up for their policies,\\' Florida GOP Chair Evan Power said of Democrats.\\nAmidst the rhetoric coming from both sides, the lack of spending by the Trump and Harris campaigns in Florida indicates neither believes the state is competitive.\\nAccording to data from ad-tracking firm AdImpact that was analyzed by NBC News, the presidential campaigns spent just $1 million on ads in Florida in the first three weeks of September compared with $47 million during the same period in 2020.\\nMore money is flowing into the U.S. Senate contest between Republican Sen. Rick Scott and Democratic challenger Debbie Mucarsel-Powell as Democrats search for a path to retain control of the Senate, but it hasn\\'t received the attention that past Senate races have in Florida.\\nWagner, the political science professor, said Democrats are caught in an \\'unwinnable situation\\' in Florida. The state is so large, in order to compete they would need to spend massive amounts of money, taking away resources from other key states.\\nFlorida Democrats are dependent on the national party to help fund big statewide races. Tyson, the GOP pollster, said the DeSantis campaign knew that if the governor ran up the score in 2022 it would dissuade Democrats from playing in Florida.\\nThat appears to be what\\'s happening.',\n",

       "   'summary': \"While many of today's EV owners charge at home most of the time, drive an electric car long enough, and eventually, you'll need to find a plug in the wild. Yes, that experience can occasionally be fraught with system failures and other headaches, but American charger availability is improving quickly.\\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Energy, the number of available public chargers in the U.S. has more than doubled over the past five years, from 57,000 in 2018 to 168,000 in 2023.\\nBut before you go, it's good to know your options and, perhaps even more important, how you'll pay for them. Yes, that last part seems like it should be easy, but even that can be a little complicated.\\nDon't worry, we have all the information you need.\\nThere are two main differences between charging at home and at a remote charger.\\nThe first is cost, a complicated topic we'll cover in more detail in just a moment. But unless you can find a free charger out in the wild (they do exist), suffice it to say it'll usually be much cheaper to charge at home.\\nThe other big difference is speed. There are three primary categories of EV chargers when it comes to charging speed: Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3. We cover them all in great detail here, but the important thing to know is the higher the number, the faster the charge.\\nThe vast majority of home chargers are either Level 1 or Level 2. A Level 1 will take upwards of a week to charge a modern EV, while a Level 2 can usually recharge a drained battery overnight.\\nLevel 3 is much, much faster, capable of giving an 80 percent charge in as little as 20 minutes. These chargers are almost exclusively available at roadside, public charging locations.\\nMore:Toyota pushes back EV production plans in America\\nA charging network is simply the number of chargers operating under the same banner or brand—even if some of the chargers themselves have independent operators.\\nThink of it like how Mobil, Sunoco or Texaco provide fuel and services to stations nationwide. Still, they don't necessarily own the facilities where that fuel is dispensed.\\nWith a charging network, though, things are a lot more complicated. A fuel pump just needs to pump a liquid into a hole, stop pumping when that hole is filled and then process payment.\\nAn electric charger, on the other hand, needs to go through a delicate dance with the EV in question to figure out how much juice it can take and how quickly. That dance, called a handshake, requires the digital exchange of information, and the charger then needs to adjust its energy output to suit.\\nThat communication continues throughout the charging process, with the car requesting current depending on factors such as battery capacity and temperature. Since these charging sessions can last an hour or more, keeping that communication open throughout the process is key.\\nAnd yes, those chargers also need to handle payment, a process that, for a few reasons, is far more complicated than it is at a gas station. We'll get into that in a moment.\\nA charging service is an entirely different beast. Here, you're talking about a service where someone will come to charge you wherever you are. Often, this is in an emergency, like when your hypermiling skills fail, and you're stuck a few miles from the nearest stationary charger.\\nWhile these charging services are still relatively rare, they are increasing, and one of the biggest providers in the U.S. is a familiar one: AAA. Mobile charging service is part of AAA's roadside assistance offerings, with members getting up to 15 minutes of free roadside charging. It's only available in 24 cities right now, but David Bennett, senior repair manager at AAA, said they're watching customer demand for future expansion.\\nAcross the pond, Allianz runs a mobile charging service in Europe with more than 100 trucks. Available in France, Germany, Italy and Spain, the trucks can provide charging at up to 75kW and are themselves electric.\\nMore:GM suspends sales of Chevy Blazer EV due to quality issues\\nChargePoint\\nChargePoint is among the longest-running charging networks globally, and it's far and away the largest, with over 315,000 chargers globally. ChargePoint covers everything from residential to commercial installations, and last year saw an 83 percent increase in active charging sessions over the year prior.\\nChargePoint's network includes a mixture of high-speed, Level 3 chargers and lower-speed, Level 2 chargers. So, although its coverage is broad, not every charger here is suitable for a quick recharge on an extended road trip.\\nChargePoint's app is its primary payment method, through which you can use credit cards, Apple Pay, Google Pay and even PayPal. Some chargers also accept credit card payments directly.\\nTesla\\nTesla's Supercharger network is surely the most famous and highly regarded set of chargers in the United States. The company has aggressively been expanding its network to match the growth of its car sales, and now that more and more manufacturers like Ford and General Motors are announcing they'll also use Tesla's NACS port, there's even more expectation for that network to grow.\\nTesla says it has over 50,000 Superchargers operational worldwide, and while it doesn't break that number down by country, roughly half of those chargers can be found in the U.S. That means about 25,000 high-speed chargers are available for NACS-compatible vehicles.\\nPayment is through Tesla's app, where owners must provide a payment method. If you drive a Tesla, your car connects directly to your account, and payment happens automatically.\\nThe details are still being figured out for other manufacturers as they start supporting NACS. With Ford, for example, once a method is provided in the FordPass app, payments will be handled automatically once you plug the car in.\\nBlink\\nBlink is one of the largest networks worldwide, with over 85,000 charging ports deployed globally at the end of 2023. Like the Supercharger network, Blink doesn't break that down by nation. Still, it's easily one of the biggest networks operating here. It is growing strongly, adding over 4,000 new charging locations in the second quarter of 2024 alone. It's also partnered with the United States Postal Service to provide charging services as our mail system switches to electrification.\\nBlink offers a variety of charger types with different payment procedures, including in-app payments, direct payment via credit card or over the phone.\\nElectrify America\\nElectrify America is another network focused on high-speed charging. Its first station back in 2018 offered 350-kilowatt speeds, and it continues to offer a mix of 150- and 350-kW charging at its 4,250 chargers across 950 stations.\\nFor payment, users can make direct credit card payments at the charger or in-app payments from the EA app. The company's chargers also support plug & charge, meaning payment happens automatically if you pull up and plug in with a compatible EV.\\nOther charging networks\\nThose are some of the top networks in the U.S., but there are plenty more. Other major players include Blink, EVgo and Shell Recharge, but there are some smaller players worth watching, too.\\nThat includes networks developed by automakers along the lines of Tesla, such as Rivian's Adventure Network, which is aiming to add high-quality chargers with nearby amenities across the U.S. Only about two years old, the network has nearly 500 high-speed chargers so far, with plans for 3,500 chargers at 600 sites.\\nAnd then there are thousands of non-network chargers out there, as well, scattered around at various businesses. Many of them are free. How do you find them? PlugShare is a great app to have on your phone, or you can always check our listing of EV chargers near you.\\nAt home, charging your EV is quite affordable. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average cost of 1 kilowatt-hour of electricity in the U.S. is $0.18. That means, for an average EV with an 80-kWh battery, roughly the size of the pack powering the Tesla Model Y, you're looking at $14.40 for a full charge from empty.\\nCharging out in the wild? Prices are all over the place. Slower, Level 2 chargers at many businesses are still free, which means if you can find one and don't mind leaving your car there all day (or night), you can get away with a free charge.\\nYou'll pay a lot more for faster, Level 3 charging. Rates vary widely between networks and locations, but expect to pay upwards of $0.50 per kWh, meaning the same 80-kWh charge would run you about $40.\\nExpensive, yes, but it still beats gas.\\nAnd there are ways to reduce those fees. Many credit cards now offer the same rebates or bonus points on EV charging they do on fuel purchases.\\nAdditionally, many networks offer some sort of subscription plan, often reducing the per-kWh cost in exchange for a fixed monthly fee. This includes Pass+ from Electrify America, which, for $7 monthly, gives you a 25 percent discount on charging rates.\\nBut there are other fees, too. Idle fees are a growing trend, with networks charging drivers who leave their cars sitting at chargers for too long. At Tesla's Supercharger network, anyone using a charger is given five minutes to clear out after their charge is complete. After that, if that Supercharger location is at greater than 50 percent capacity, another $0.50 per minute is added to your bill, or $1.00 per minute if the station is completely full. That'll add up quickly if you decide to go watch a movie!\\nWith gas, you usually pull up, swipe or tap a credit card, pump your fuel and then drive away. Easy.\\nEV charging is usually a bit more complicated. As mentioned above, different networks support different payment methods. While some EV chargers do offer credit card readers, making the process quite easy, plenty of others require the use of something else.\\nMost often, it's an app of some sort. Charge an EV in public often enough, and you'll find your phone littered with icons from a half-dozen networks, each with its own login credentials and security procedures. If you don't use a password manager already, this is a very good excuse to finally sign up for one.\\nWhy is it so much more complicated to pay? There are a few reasons. Partly it's because of the fees mentioned above, which might mean added charges to your card after your charge is completed.\\nAnother reason is that, by using an app to pay, these charging networks can learn more about your habits. They can create a profile of data about you, what you drive and when you're most likely to charge. Ideally, this can be used to help them build a better network. But it's also potentially valuable trend data that could be sold to others looking to learn about the habits of EV owners.\\nFinally, most charging networks would prefer you to use in-app payments to reduce their operating costs. By doing things through an app and pre-charged accounts, networks can better bundle charges together to avoid per-transaction fees. These can be substantial when you're talking about a flurry of small charges.\\nOnce you have all the apps and plan your route, you should be good to go. Make sure you check out our guide for EV charger etiquette, because nobody wants to be rude at the plug. But other than that, it should be clear charging.\",\n",

       "   'summary': 'Seven continents, 183.4 miles, 168 hours.\\nThat\\'s the ultra-endurance adventure a Froedtert Hospital cancer surgeon is undertaking to kick off the new year.\\nDr. Clark Gamblin, 55, is one of an international team of 60 runners participating in the 2025 World Marathon Challenge from Jan. 31 to Feb. 6. Participants run seven marathons (26.2 miles each), one on each of the seven continents, over the course of seven days.\\nThe week begins in Novolazarevskaya, Antarctica ― a research station on Earth\\'s most remote continent. Runners then fly to Cape Town, South Africa; Perth, Australia; Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Madrid, Spain; and Fortaleza, Brazil; before finishing in Miami. The World Marathon Challenge is advertised as both a \"logistical and physical endeavor.\" In addition to running over 180 miles, participants spend about 60 hours in the air traveling between race destinations.\\nFinishers are inducted into the Intercontinental Marathon Club, which has less than 200 members.\\nFor Gamblin, this globetrotting feat is about more than just running. In addition to treating cancer patients for over 25 years, Gamblin himself is a cancer survivor. He was diagnosed with testicular cancer in 2018 and underwent chemotherapy and multiple operations before becoming cancer-free in 2020.\\nThrough his participation in the World Marathon Challenge, the doctor plans to raise awareness and funds for the Testicular Cancer Awareness Foundation ― a nonprofit dedicated to providing education, raising awareness and ending the stigma surrounding the disease.\\nTesticular cancer is the most common type of cancer affecting men ages 15 to 44, and it\\'s \"super-treatable\" if detected early, Gamblin said.\\n\"Men\\'s health is not something people are public about very often,\" said the doctor, who hopes to raise $250,000 via the marathon challenge. \"So, I\\'m hopeful that this will raise awareness, and it\\'ll inspire folks.\"\\nA former high school runner who ran \"a few marathons\" in college, Gamblin took an extended break from high-level racing until 2018 when, as a board member of the American Liver Foundation, he was offered entry into that year\\'s Boston Marathon.\\nAfter completing a notoriously cold and rainy edition of the prestigious race, Gamblin learned about the six Abbott World Marathon Majors and set out to complete all of them ― Boston, New York City, Chicago, Berlin, London and Tokyo.\\nHowever, between the Boston and New York City marathons, Gamblin received his cancer diagnosis. He began working with a treatment team from Froedtert and the Medical College of Wisconsin.\\nDespite having been a cancer surgeon for 20 years, he said battling the disease himself gave him a \"different perspective,\" as well as a chance to apply a lot of the advice he\\'d given patients over the years.\\n\"The running really helped,\" he said. \"Running has always been somewhat therapeutic for me and a chance to reflect, pray and refocus. I ran with a lot of gratitude when I was going through treatment.\"\\nWhen Gamblin was accepted into the New York City Marathon, he\\'d just received chemotherapy and remembers asking his treatment team if it would even be smart to run. After a greenlight from his medical oncologist, Gamblin finished the race in under five hours.\\nHe earned his Six Star Medal in 2023 after completing the Berlin Marathon in 2019, Chicago in 2021, London in 2022 and Tokyo in 2023. He ran many of the races to benefit the American Liver Foundation and other health-focused charities.\\nWhen a friend brought the World Marathon Challenge to Gamblin\\'s attention earlier this year, the doctor immediately decided it was his next running goal. But, his wife, Jan, was apprehensive; she worried he could get hurt.\\n\"The body will do what the mind tells it to do,\" he told her. And eventually, Jan was convinced. Gamblin calls her his \"No. 1 cheerleader\" through his training and each of his marathons.\\n\"I think that far too often, we don\\'t set our goals high enough ...,\" Gamblin said. \"This race is about pushing boundaries a little bit and recognizing that we can do far more than perhaps we think we\\'re capable of. ... In my work and in my personal life, it\\'s about providing hope for people.\"\\nGamblin runs 50 to 60 miles per week to train for this winter\\'s event. He said his biggest training week will include four marathons in seven days.\\nThe doctor, who said he\\'s run his fastest marathon in under four hours, said his goal is to run between 4:00 and 4:30 for each leg of the World Marathon Challenge. He thinks the Antarctica race ― eight 3.26-mile loops around an aircraft ice runway ― will be the hardest. Participants will run on packed snow in 15-degree weather wearing ski goggles, trail shoes and snow pants. The race Gamblin thinks will be the easiest might come as a surprise.\\n\"The easiest one will probably be (the seventh one in) Miami because my family and my three kids will be there,\" he said. \"It\\'ll be special.\"\\nGamblin hopes to raise $250,000 for the Testicular Cancer Awareness Foundation through his participation in the World Marathon Challenge. So far, as of Friday morning, he has raised over $66,000 online.\\nYou can donate to his online fundraiser here: pledge.to/7-marathons-7-continents-7-days. You can also text 777 to 707070 to receive the donation link.\\nGamblin said he\\'s thankful for the corporate sponsors ― Froedtert, Medical College of Wisconsin, the Milwaukee Brewers and others ― who helped cover his nearly $50,000 race and travel fees. All money raised from individual donations will go directly to the Testicular Cancer Awareness Foundation.',\n",

So while his five ASA Midwest Tour trophies earned at Wisconsin International Raceway in Kaukauna are big for Majeski personally, the Oktoberfest 200 trophies – his fourth earned Sunday – are at least as important.\\n'This is our Super Bowl,' Majeski said. 'Snowball Derby is probably the biggest race we go to but the one that probably means the most to us is this race here, Oktoberfest.\\n'Before (crew chief) Toby (Nuttleman) and I got together, Toby had never won this race, believe it or not, and now we've got four of them together, which is really cool. … We always have a good car here, always a lot of fun.'\\nResults:2024 ASA Midwest Tour Oktoberfest 200\\nAndrew Morrissey, a two-time Oktoberfest winner, recovered from a crash on the fifth lap to finish second, and Michael Hinde, a first-time visitor from Florida, drove through the field after a midrace incident for third place.\\nGabe Sommers finished fourth and took his second straight ASA Midwest Tour season championship comfortably after electrical issues left pursuer Levon Van Der Geest six laps down in 21st.\\nMajeski won for the fifth time in eight starts in the series this season. He started ninth, got to the lead in less than 60 laps and took the lead for good on the 122nd lap, beating Johnny Sauter on restart.\\n'Johnny had me nervous,' Majeski said. 'He was really good very late in that last run, and I was like, I don't know if we have anything for him. We made a couple minor adjustments and we thought he pushed his stuff too hard. … It was a cat and mouse game. Do you let him lead or do you ride more, I decided to keep the lead and it ended up being the right decision.'\\nAnother caution put Sauter alongside with 20 laps to go, but Majeski pulled away and Sauter faded to eighth.\\nMajeski became the third four-time Oktoberfest 200 winner, following Dan Fredrickson and Travis Sauter, and is one away from tying the late Joe Shear for the all-time lead in the event that signifies the end of the super late model season in Wisconsin.\",\n",

When that magnetic activity is released, it creates intense bursts of radiation resulting in solar flares hurtling toward Earth at the speed of light.\\nSome of these flares can be accompanied by coronal mass ejections that emerge from the sun's outermost atmosphere, the corona.\\nThese ejections can collide with Earth's magnetosphere, the barrier protecting humanity from the harshest impacts of space weather, to produce geomagnetic storms that unleash spectacular views of the northern lights in parts of the country where auroras are not often visible.\",\n",

       "   'summary': 'Migrant apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border fell 75% in September from a year ago to the lowest level since the Trump administration, according to preliminary data obtained by USA TODAY.\\nThe number of migrant encounters and apprehensions between ports of entry dropped below 54,000 in September, according to the preliminary data.\\nThe decline puts U.S. Border Patrol on track to report roughly 1.5 million unlawful crossings in fiscal 2024, down from more than 2 million in fiscal 2023. The federal fiscal year runs October 1 to September 30.\\nOn an annual basis, it would be the lowest level since fiscal 2020, when the Trump administration reported roughly 400,000 encounters and apprehensions amid the global COVID-19 pandemic. The last time monthly apprehensions and encounters fell below 50,000 was August 2020.\\nMigrant apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border first fell below half a million annually during the Obama administration, in 2010, and stayed under that level for the next eight years.\\nApprehensions reached their low point for the era around 310,000 in 2017 during the first year of the Trump administration before they began climbing again. Under Trump, crossings rose in 2018 and surged in 2019 to more than 850,000, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\\nThe current decline in unlawful migration began earlier this year and accelerated in June, when the Biden administration used an executive order to restrict asylum access at the U.S.-Mexico border. At the same time, Mexico began an enforcement effort that has prevented many migrants from reaching the U.S. border.\\nShifts in U.S. and Mexican border enforcement policies often lead to temporary declines in border crossings as migrants wait and see how policies will affect them, and smugglers evaluate how to poke holes in the system.\\nWith the U.S. presidential election looming, the September level could represent a low water mark in illegal migration, said Adam Isaacson, director for defense oversight at the Washington Office on Latin America in Washington, D.C.\\n\"At some point migrants and smugglers are going to figure out who the policies – like the asylum ban – hit the hardest and who doesn\\'t get hit at all,\" including populations that are difficult to deport, he said.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'WASHINGTON – You can use her full name if you want, but many years have passed since Melania Trump needed it.\\nThe former first lady may not have the creative or policy achievements of a Beyoncé, Rihanna, Bono or Hillary, but here she is, one month out from Election Day, with a slim memoir bearing the one-word title of a would-be icon: \\'Melania\" (256 pp, Skyhorse)\\nPacked with photos of the onetime fashion model, the book is a plainspoken dash through Melania\\'s life, from her Cold War childhood in Yugoslavia – where her father was a prosperous businessman who drove a Citroën Maserati SM, one of the coolest cars ever made – to her arrival in New York at age 26, to her life with a certain real estate mogul-turned-president.\\nThere\\'s a lot \\'Melania\\' doesn\\'t say about the Trump White House. No worry: Plenty of former Trump aides and appointees have come forward to fill those gaps. No one should pay the book\\'s $40 asking price for keen political insight.\\nMore:Donald Trump on Melania Trump\\'s abortion comments: \\'You have to write what you believe\\'\\nWhat you get instead is a portrait of a woman who was adjacent to great power – and who may yet be again – and her strong dedication to her son, parents and husband.\\nHere are seven takeaways from \\'Melania.\\'\\nWhile less bombastic than Donald Trump in her claims, \\'Melania\\' leaves no doubt that Melania still clings to a false belief the 2020 election was stolen.\\nMelania writes that in the run-up to November 2020 \\'...the media, Big Tech, and the deep state were all determined to prevent Donald\\'s election, by any means necessary.\\' She \\'worried the election would be unfair.\\'\\nThe former first lady describes \\'suspicious voting activity being reported all over the country\\' on Election Day, while ignoring the cold fact that 30-odd judges – some appointed by her own husband – threw out Trump\\'s election challenges on the merits.\\nAnd she makes no mention of the federal and state criminal charges the former president faces in Washington, D.C., and in Georgia over his efforts to overturn his 2020 loss to President Joe Biden.\\n\\'Many Americans still have doubts to this day,\\' she writes. \\'I am not the only one who questions the results.\\'\\nMelania Trump isn\\'t the first first lady to break with her husband on important issues. Laura Bush also supported abortion rights while her husband, George W. Bush, ran and governed as an abortion foe.\\nPolls show Donald Trump, who has bragged that the constitutional right to abortion was overturned thanks to the three Supreme Court justices he appointed, is losing badly to Kamala Harris among women voters.\\nWill Melania\\'s big reveal, nearly four years after the Trumps left the White House, make a difference?\\nFraming the issue as one of personal freedom, Melania writes, \\'A woman\\'s fundamental right to individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy.\\'\\nMore:Florida abortion measure shows how Trump has struggled with abortion politics after Roe\\nOne of the key responsibilities of the first lady is to the upkeep and decoration of the White House, and \\'Melania\\' details her work to renovate the two-century-old presidential headquarters and residence.\\nBut on one day in October 2019, Melania describes being called away from her duties to join her husband, Vice President Mike Pence, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, and other security big-wigs in the Situation Room to watch a live feed of a Delta Force raid in Syria.\\nThe target: Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the self-styled \\'caliph\\' of the murderous Islamic State terrorist army. \\'Watch this incredible action at work,\\' the president whispers.\\nMelania writes that she was impressed by the raid, but left before its climax: Al-Baghdadi, cornered by military dogs in an underground tunnel, detonated a suicide vest, killing himself.\\nYou can still feel Melania\\'s fury at Rosie O\\'Donnell, a former host of \\'The View\\' and a longtime adversary of her husband, for a Twitter stunt targeting then 10-year-old Barron Trump.\\nTwo weeks after Donald Trump\\'s 2016 election victory, O\\'Donnell tweeted a link to a video suggesting Barron was on the autism spectrum. The comedian claimed she was trying to erase stigma.\\n\\'I was appalled by such cruelty. It was clear to me that she was not interested in raising awareness about autism,\\' Melania writes. \\'I felt that she was attacking my son because she didn\\'t like my husband.\\'\\n\\'There is nothing shameful about autism (though O\\'Donnell\\'s tweet implied that there was), but Barron is not autistic,\\' she says. \\'...Bullying a ten-year-old boy is egregious, but doing so under the flimsy pretense of \\'bringing awareness\\'...is truly repulsive.\\'\\nO\\'Donnell apologized and deleted her tweet days later.\\nMelania makes no mention of the many allegations of sexual misconduct made against Donald Trump, from his purported tryst with porn actress Stormy Daniels, to a reported affair with former Playboy model Karen McDougal, to more serious claims of assault made by several women, including writer E. Jean Carroll.\\nThe former president was found civilly liable earlier this year for assaulting Carroll and then defaming her when he denied it. He was convicted of dozens of felonies in a New York court – a first for a former president – of doctoring business records to conceal hush money payments made to Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election. Trump is appealing both verdicts.\\nMore:Did Donald Trump rape E. Jean Carroll? Here\\'s what a jury and judge said.\\nMelania writes that she was slow to learn about the frenzied assault on the Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters on Jan. 6, 2021. Working with a team to document and prepare the White House for its new occupants, she writes, \\'I wasn\\'t thinking of it as the day Congress would certify the election results.\\'\\nStephanie Grisham, a former aide to both Melania and Donald Trump, has described asking Melania to denounce the violence at the Capitol, even as the president was still refusing to. According to Grisham, who has endorsed Democrat Kamala Harris for president, Melania replied, \\'No.\\'\\n\\'Had I been fully informed of the details, naturally, I would have immediately denounced the violence at the Capitol building,\\' Melania writes in her memoir.\\nMelania writes that she didn\\'t learn of the assault on the Capitol until the White House\\'s chief usher told her. Her condemnation includes a swipe at Pence, who was targeted by rioters for his refusal to block the certification of Biden\\'s victory.\\n\\'The violence we witnessed was unequivocally unacceptable,\\' Melania writes. \\'While I recognized that many individuals felt the election was mishandled and the vice president should halt the confirmation process, we must never resort to violence.\\'\\nThe most intense moment in \\'Melania\\' was perhaps the most intense moment for the nation so far this year: the shooting of Donald Trump by a 20-year-old sniper at a July campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'Camp Randall Stadium is hosting its first concert since 1997 next year — featuring a band that hasn\\'t performed in Wisconsin since 2009.\\nColdplay is coming to the Wisconsin Badgers football stadium July 19, as part of its \"Music of the Spheres World Tour,\" the Chris Martin-led British band officially announced on its website Tuesday.\\nThe tour stop wasn\\'t a closely guarded secret. On Saturday, an announcement was made during the Badgers game against Purdue that details about the stadium\\'s first concert in nearly 30 years would be revealed on Tuesday. But DJs during the game seemed to drop a hint when they played back-to-back Coldplay songs after the announcement.\\nAlso: Coldplay previously had teased on social media a tour announcement using abbreviations for different states, including Wisconsin — and the band last week held the world premiere of its latest album \"Moon Music\" in Wisconsin, at the Moon Saloon in the town of Moon, a couple of hours\\' drive north of the stadium.\\nOn Sunday night, the Badgers and Madison-based concert promoter FPC Live shared a video on its social media channels that flashed the band\\'s name and some of the band\\'s logos on video screens inside the empty stadium.\\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\\nLast month, the stadium-dominant tour — named for Coldplay\\'s 2021 album — was proclaimed the top-selling and bestselling rock tour of all time. So far, it has grossed $945.7 million from 8.8 million tickets since it began in March 2022, according to Billboard.\\nBut a Coldplay tour hasn\\'t come through Wisconsin since July 25, 2009, when the band played Alpine Valley Music Theatre in East Troy behind 2008\\'s signature \"Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends.\" And the band has never played Madison before: The only places Coldplay has performed in Wisconsin are Alpine, and the Rave and Bradley Center in Milwaukee.\\nAlso featuring fellow original members Jonny Buckland, Guy Berryman and Will Champion, Coldplay will have plenty of music for Wisconsin fans to catch up on next year. Previous \"Music of the Spheres\" shows have included songs from 2011\\'s \"Mylo Xyloto,\" 2014\\'s \"Ghost Stories,\" 2015\\'s \"A Head Full of Dreams,\" 2019\\'s \"Everyday Life\" plus greatest hits from earlier albums like \"Parachutes,\" \"A Rush of Blood to the Head\" and \"X&Y.\"\\nBut as long as it\\'s been since Coldplay has played in Wisconsin, it\\'s been much longer since Camp Randall Stadium last staged a concert.\\nThe most recent show was in 1997, with the Rolling Stones on their \"Bridges to Babylon Tour.\" U2 also played the Madison stadium the same year. The handful of Camp Randall headliners from the late \\'80s through the \\'90s also included Pink Floyd and Genesis, with openers ranging from Lenny Kravitz to Blues Traveler to Public Enemy.\\nTickets for the general public for Coldplay\\'s Camp Randall Stadium concert — and for nine other North American stadium concerts spanning from May through July next year — will go on sale at noon local time Friday, Oct. 11, at ticketmaster.com.\\nFans can sign up for presale access at coldplay.com until 9 a.m. Central Time Thursday. Presales for each show open at 9 a.m. local time Friday.\\nColdplay also will offer a limited number of $20 tickets for each concert through Ticketmaster at noon local time Nov. 22.',\n",

       "   'excerpt': 'Anna Lardinois, the author of several books about ghost stories and creator of Milwaukee ghost tours, shares a few of her favorites.',\n",
       "   'summary': 'When Milwaukee-area native Anna Lardinois was an English teacher years ago, she spent her spring breaks travelling to other cities. She loves walking around cities at night, but as a woman traveling solo, she often felt unsafe doing so. Then she discovered ghost tours.\\nShe loved how it was a novel way to learn about a city\\'s buildings and history. She loved the opportunity to walk around cities at night. And she loved the delicious creepiness of the ghost stories. That\\'s how a new career was born in 2012 when she started Gothic Milwaukee, a company that hosts ghost and history tours of Milwaukee.\\nDuring the pandemic, Lardinois pivoted from offering public tours to focus on writing and public speaking, and she\\'s written several ghost story books, including compilations of Milwaukee and Madison ghost stories and a book about Great Lakes shipwrecks.\\nIn a recent interview with the Journal Sentinel, Lardinois talked about what she loves about ghost stories, the process that goes into research, and a few of her favorite Milwaukee ghost stories.\\nLardinois has researched Milwaukee ghost stories at the Milwaukee County Historical Society and Central Library, where she discovered that local newspapers \"used to record ghostly stories much more often than they do now.\"\\nShe hit the research jackpot in 2018 when she became the narrator-in-residence at the Pfister Hotel, which is often cited as one of the most haunted places in Milwaukee.\\n\"They let me go through all their archives at the Pfister and most of them weren\\'t even ghostly, but it was still tremendously exciting for a nerd like me,\" Lardinois said, laughing. \"Like, oh, here\\'s a sample of the carpeting from 1968; that was just ridiculously exciting.\"\\nLardinois says the story of Charles Pfister — the adopted son of Guido Pfister, whose dream was to open a grand Milwaukee hotel — is her \"very favorite ghost story of Milwaukee.\"\\nMany people — including plenty of athletes who have stayed at the hotel — believe that unexplained occurrences including knocking, temperature changes and electronics turning on and off, have been caused by Charles, whose ghost still lives in his father\\'s hotel.\\nLardinois noted that Guido Pfister died a few months before the hotel opened and that Charles took on the running of the hotel, living there until his death decades later.\\n\"It makes sense to me to imagine that this guy for whom it was so important to make his dad\\'s dreams come true, that he would still be there in the afterlife taking care of things,\" Lardinois said. \"The stories of the baseball players are totally fascinating, too, because you\\'ll notice it\\'s always the teams playing against the Brewers that have problems at the hotel.\\n\"That\\'s kind of just another way Charles is perpetually taking care of the city.\"\\nLardinois was so \"very clearly invested\" in the story of Charles Pfister that, during her yearlong narrator-in-residence, she would go to all the places in the hotel where he was said to have been spotted.\\n\"I would be in those places all by myself and just say, \\'Charles, I understand you, there\\'s no one who\\'s a bigger fan. It won\\'t scare me if you appear to me,\" Lardinois said, laughing.\\nSo did she ever see him?\\n\"No, I think I came in with too much energy, I was just too needy for him.\"\\nLardinois said she\\'s been criticized before for \"skewing toward delightful\" ghost stories during tours and away from the more morbid stories she \"doesn\\'t feel good about telling.\"\\nA good example of that is City Hall, where a number of people have died by suicide.\\nInstead of telling those stories, Lardinois used her tours of City Hall to focus on Milwaukee history, including the \"battle between Solomon Juneau and Byron Kilbourn.\"\\nThe two men are both credited with being founders of Milwaukee, although Juneau (who preferred the east side) and Kilbourn (a west-side advocate) had well-publicized disagreements over the future of the city.\\n\"In my version of the story, I highlight the unpleasantness of Kilbourn — he lived in Chicago at one point, so of course he\\'s the worst,\" Lardinois said. She also noted that City Hall\\'s 22,500-pound bell is named after Juneau, which she imagines the famously prickly Kilbourn would be offended by, even as a ghost.\\n\"There are stories of sounds of tremendous crashing and lots of activity in the basement of City Hall when no one is there,\" Lardinois said. \"I imagine that that\\'s just Byron Kilbourn crashing around because he\\'s still mad that City Hall was built in East Town, not Westown.\"\\nMilwaukee\\'s \"Bridge War\":The story behind the city\\'s crooked bridges\\nThroughout her career as a ghost storyteller, Lardinois has learned stories from dozens of cities. But when asked if Milwaukee has the best ghosts, she answered, \"Oh, of course.\"\\n\"What I love about Milwaukee ghosts is how really hardworking they are,\" Lardinois said. \"There are so many Milwaukeeans that return to their place of work when they become ghosts.\"\\nIn addition to Charles Pfister, Lardinois shares several other favorite stories of Milwaukee\\'s \"hardworking\" ghosts in her book \"Milwaukee Ghosts and Legends.\"\\nThere\\'s the story of the former director of the Milwaukee Public Museum, Stephan Francis de Borhegyi, who died in 1969 in a car accident a few blocks away from the museum. According to Lardinois\\' book, many museum staff members believe the director still hangs out on the third floor of the museum, where \"many have reported catching glimpses of a man in a cape out of the corner of their eye...\" and \"...hearing the sounds of hearty laughter and smelling the familiar scent of pipe tobacco as they move through his beloved collections.\"\\nIn her book, Lardinois also tells the story of the young Miller Brewery worker who, decades ago, would meet his girlfriend in the historic Miller caves. Tragically, the worker fell and hit his head on a staircase in the caves one day; he died several days later. A few months afterward, the young woman also died, and \"while the doctors diagnosed her with a lung ailment, many of the young man\\'s former coworkers were convinced that she died of a broken heart.\" The couple seems to haunt the man\\'s former workplace, where employees would claim to catch glimpses of the two of them and hear \"bits of conversation and laughter.\"\\nAnother brewery-related story involves beer baron Valentin Blatz, who died in 1894 and is believed to haunt his old office in a building that is now the alumni center at the Milwaukee School of Engineering. In her book, Lardinois says that the smell of Blatz\\'s unique tobacco and a sense of his presence made employees believe \"that his spirit returned to the office and remained, carefully watching the progress of his brewery.\"\\nFinally, one of the stories \"tending toward the delightful\" type that Lardinois favors is recounted in her book when she writes about Clair Richardson, who co-founded the Skylight Music Theatre. Although he died in 1980, the belief persists that he haunts the Cabot Theatre in the Historic Third Ward. The belief is reinforced by his ashes, which, by his request, are kept in an urn below the stage, \"so (as he explained) future decisions \\'would be made over his dead body,\\'\" Lardinois writes.',\n",

       "   'summary': \"Milwaukee is home to dozens of different neighborhoods.\\nHere's what to know about the Washington Park neighborhood, which has just under 5,000 residents:\\nThe neighborhood is named after its park. Washington Park, located on Milwaukee's west side, is flanked by State 175 on its west side and splits the Washington Heights neighborhood from the Washington Park neighborhood.\\nTechnically, the neighborhood is from North 47th Street west-east to North 35th Street. The northern boundary is West North Avenue and southern boundary is West Vliet Street.\\nIn the late 19th century, city officials purchased 124 aces of land to develop an epic park. It would be one of seven plots of land the Milwaukee Board of Park Commissioners would purchase.\\nThe board tapped Frederick Law Olmsted, the designer of New York City's Central Park, to design Lake, Riverside (then known as River) and West Park, which would later be named Washington Park.\\nIncluded in Olmsted's design was a seven-acre lagoon. The park also featured Milwaukee's first zoo, from 1892 until 1958. Wealthy patrons would donate animals to the modest zoo. In the beginning, there were five deer and, shortly after, a buck, an eagle and an elephant. Within a few years, the park had goats, monkeys and more elephants.\\nIn 1900, the park's name was changed to Washington Park. In 1909, the city's first public golf course opened at the park, and later a horse racing track, lawn tennis courts, a toboggan slide and a pool were added. In 1938, the bandshell was added by beer baron Emil Blatz. The Emil Blatz Temple of Music once attracted the likes of Louis Armstrong and B.B. King.\\nIn 1948, the zoo had to move to its current location on West Blue Mound Road because Milwaukee residents voted to approve funding for the construction of a new freeway on the park's western edge, cutting it off from residents on that side.\\nIn recent years, there has been an effort to convert State 175 to an at-grade boulevard, which would help in reconnecting the park with its neighbors to the west.\\nIn the mid- to late 1800s, the area attracted a number of well-off Germans who built country estates. The homes of Franz Joseph Uhrig, Ludwig von Baumbach and Frederick Koenig still stand in the neighborhood.\\nThe development of the park attracted more German settlers. When World War I broke out, there was a backlash against Germans in Milwaukee, and a German-American cultural society donated the statue of Frederick Wilhelm von Steuben to the park as a symbol of German loyalty to America.\\nThe statue of von Steuben on horseback sits at the intersection of West Lisbon Avenue and North Sherman Boulevard, across from the Washington Park Library. Von Steuben served with George Washington during the Revolutionary War.\\nIn the late 19th century, the Miller Brewing Company and the Falk Corporation established factories in areas just adjacent to Washington Park. Many workers followed their employers to the neighborhood and built single-family and duplex homes nearby.\\nSoon, this new community developed vibrant commercial corridors along North Avenue, Vliet Street and Lisbon Avenue, which runs diagonally through the neighborhood.\\nAside from Germans, people of other backgrounds opened businesses along Vliet Street throughout the 1900s. Among the owners were Irish, Austrians, Jews, Hungarians, Croatians, Poles, Czechs, Italians, Chinese, Russians and Scots. There were taverns, shops, barbers, tailors, bakeries, markets and a theater.\\nMaxwell Kohl opened one of the earliest Kohl's Food Markets at what is now the location of the Hmong-American Friendship Association on Vliet Street, which offers services and programming for the Hmong population in Milwaukee.\\nWashington Park is home for many in the Asian population, mostly Hmong and Lao. The overwhelming majority of residents in the neighborhood, about 80%, are Black.\\nAfter World War II, Washington Park benefited from the postwar housing boom. By the 1970s and after the construction of the State 175 freeway, much of the European-American population moved to the suburbs while Blacks, Latinos and Hmong moved into the neighborhood.\\nIn the 1980s, the neighborhood was hit hard by deindustrialization and, soon, prosperity for those in the neighborhood declined.\\nThere has been a resurgence of new developments happening along Vliet Street in the last few years. The Washington Park Media Center, 4303 W. Vliet St., opened recently and has space for video recording and editing equipment, online conferencing and other activities.\\nJust to the media center's east, a long-vacant building at 4227 W. Vliet St. was renovated to house Denizen MKE, a venue that hosts weddings and other events.\\nThe former movie theater, 3804 W. Vliet St., was converted and became home to an accounting firm, Metz & Associates, and other businesses.\\nToday, the park attracts not just neighborhood residents but people from the surrounding areas for events. Washington Park Wednesdays, a free concert series, carries on a tradition that once attracted up to 40,000 people to the park.\\nThe park remains a cornerstone on the west side of Milwaukee and is home to an Urban Ecology Center location. The center, which opened its Washington Park location in 2007, provides year-round educational programs for the public looking to connect to nature.\\nWashington Park also has a senior center at 4420 W. Vliet St.\\nThere are city-funded programs happening at the Washington Park Library, which moved to its current location, 2121 N. Sherman Blvd., in 2003. The 20,000-square-foot, two-story building, cost $4.2 million. The library is across West Lloyd Street from the park.\\nTransition High School is at 1940 N. 36th St. The school helps Milwaukee Public Schools students returning from incarceration or expulsion. Mary McLeod Bethune Academy is located at 1535 N. 35th St.\",\n",

       "   'excerpt': 'Jobs, remote work, stock market gains and housing profits: Here are some of the recent economic trends that might carry forward into 2025.',\n",
       "   'summary': 'With three months to go, 2024 has turned out to be a relatively good year economically, with low unemployment, declining interest rates, easing inflation and gains for people owning stocks and real estate.\\nHere are some of the key trends that might carry forward to 2025, or beyond:\\nNo recession appears to be in the cards through 2024 and possibly longer. The latest assessment of a soft landing comes from an economic advisory panel of the American Bankers Association. The 15 bank chief economists in this group expect the economy to grow 2% over the second half of 2024 and in 2025. They view near-term recession risks at 30%, unchanged from their prior semiannual forecast in March.\\nAmong risks, the economists point to a softer labor market, with fewer openings and a modest uptick in layoffs. The nation\\'s unemployment rate has risen from 3.4% at the beginning of 2023 to 4.2% in August 2024. The economists expect that it will rise to 4.4% in early 2025. They also anticipate inflation will continue to ease and hit the Federal Reserve\\'s 2% target by the second quarter of 2025. And they expect further interest rate cuts through 2025.\\nHomeowners, meanwhile, should expect slower price gains ahead, with economists predicting home-price appreciation will ease from 6.8% in this year\\'s second quarter to 3.1% by the fourth quarter of 2025. This trend will be accompanied by a gradual decline in mortgage interest rates, they say.\\nFed Chair Jerome Powell:\\'Growing confidence\\' inflation cooling, more rate cuts possible\\nThis has been a year of rising personal wealth, with no signs of it abating. But the gains haven\\'t been shared equally, with the gap widening between the haves and have-nots, noted David Kelly, chief global strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, in a recent commentary.\\nKelly estimates that the net worth of American households has risen to a record $157 trillion, or $446,000 per person on average. That\\'s up by 47% or $50 trillion over the past five years. Rising stock prices have driven much of this wealth increase. Corporations have been posting higher profits that reflect, in part, \\'more favorable tax treatment, declining inflation and interest rates and diminished union power.\\'\\nWhile the stock market has generated most of the wealth gains, the nation\\'s 87 million homeowners now, on average, sit on about $400,000 in home equity compared to $240,000 five years ago.\\nThese broad wealth gains are helping to sustain consumer spending and keep the economy moving forward. They also are helping to mute credit problems and ease worries about retirement for millions of people.\\nBut the gains haven\\'t been distributed evenly. Renters, for example, have not benefitted from rising home prices. Also, federal government debt has surged, Kelly noted, and that\\'s something Americans eventually will need to repay, at least in part, through taxation. In addition, the stock-market surge has attracted foreign capital, contributing to a strong dollar and an ongoing U.S. trade deficit, Kelly said. That tends to undermine manufacturing jobs in this country.\\nIf the trend toward greater inequality continues, it could worsen populist politics and \"lead to decisions that are damaging both to the economy overall and wealth accumulation in particular,\\' Kelly wrote.\\nSeptember jobs data:Blowout jobs figures points to solid economy and slower Fed rate cuts, analysts say\\nJobs have been plentiful in recent years and workplace policies fairly benign, but employees should brace for a bit tougher slogging ahead.\\nOne trend noted in a recent survey of executives involves more companies, roughly one in three, implementing or planning layoffs. Some firms also are requiring employees to return to offices. This coincides with cost-cutting measures such as reduced travel budgets, which remain prevalent but haven\\'t noticeably risen over the past year, according to the survey of 182 human-resources executives by Challenger, Gray & Christmas.\\nAbout one-third of the executives surveyed said they\\'re worried about \\'quiet quitting\\' where employees disengage or do minimal work without resigning. But many of the executives said they had no concrete evidence of that happening or declining productivity, according to the survey, which was conducted in July and August.\\nThe executives surveyed acknowledged that employees greatly value flexibility in terms of remote or hybrid work. \"About 54% of companies continue to offer hybrid or fully remote work options, demonstrating that flexibility is here to stay,\\' said Challenger, Gray & Christmas.\\nThe stock market has been on a roll lately, but it has a reputation for not faring well in October, especially when there\\'s a presidential election pending. October can evoke fear on Wall Street as memories are stirred of sharp losses in 1929, 1987, 1997, 2008 and other years, wrote Jeffrey Hirsch, editor of the 2024 edition of the \"Stock Trader\\'s Almanac.\" In a recent blog, he didn\\'t provide an explanation for October\\'s historic weakness, other than noting some of those sharp declines in past years.\\nYet despite October\\'s reputation for being a down month, many of the results for October have been more so-so than miserable, even during election years. Over the past 18 Octobers that preceded elections since 1950, stocks in the S&P 500 index were up nine times and down nine times, for an average loss for the month of 0.9%, according to Hirsch.\\nViewed differently, October sometimes marks the last downward leg before a rally commences. Since World War II, stocks reversed course 13 times during October, ending what had been downward or bear markets during those years and embarking on a new upward trend.',\n",

On Friday, Milwaukee police said an officer had fired at the man, but authorities were not certain if the officer had struck him.\\nOn Monday, the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner's Office said it was investigating the 33-year-old's death as a homicide. The police department cited preliminary findings from the medical examiner's autopsy in confirming an officer's gunfire had struck the man.\\nThe confirmation comes after police responded to a shooting on the 4100 block of North 68th Street on Friday. At a press conference following the incident, Milwaukee Police Chief Jeffrey Norman said an officer fired at the man after he disregarded commands to drop a gun.\\nThe standoff began as police arrived in response to a reported shooting. Norman said officers arrived at the residence to see three victims leaping from a second-story porch, with one injured from gunshot wounds.\\nAs they moved the victims to safety, the man appeared on the porch with a firearm and disregarded commands to drop his firearm, Norman said.\\nAt that time, a 28-year-old police officer with three years of experience fired at the suspect. On Friday, Norman said it was unclear if the officer's fire hit the man, who had moved back inside the residence.\\nAfter officers attempted a 'peaceful resolution' with no response from the suspect, the police chief said officers entered the home and found him dead from a gunshot wound with his gun next to him.\\nMonday's confirmation means bodycam footage will be released within 15 days to the public, according to department policy. Police previously said the man who fired at the suspect was placed on administrative leave.\\nNorman said the Brookfield Police Department is investigating the incident, as part of the Milwaukee Area Investigative Team.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"GREEN BAY – Green Bay Packers coach Matt LaFleur said he expects wide receiver Romeo Doubs to return to the team Wednesday and move forward after missing the Los Angeles Rams game due to suspension.\\nLaFleur said he met with Doubs on Monday, and while he didn't want to get into specifics about their conversation, he said he was satisfied with the outcome.\\n'What's done is done and we're moving forward,' LaFleur said during his Monday afternoon news conference. 'I expect us collectively as a team to continue to move that way.'\\nLaFleur did not discuss why Doubs decided to skip practice Thursday and Friday without an excuse, leading to him getting suspended for the Rams game for conduct detrimental to the team.\\nA source has confirmed Sports Illustrated's report that Doubs was unhappy with his role, despite being among the leaders in targets this season.\\nLaFleur said he wanted to make one thing clear about Doubs' situation: 'The one thing I'll say about it is, I mean, it's a pretty isolated incident. Like this has not happened with him before. I don't expect it to happen moving forward.'\\nStarting with the Minnesota game, there has been a shift toward getting receiver Dontayvion Wicks more involved in the offense. He got off to a slow start this season, but against Minnesota he was targeted 13 times, the most of any player and eight more times than Doubs.\\nWicks had three drops in the game, but the plan was to continue to keep him involved given his history of explosive plays. Tight end Tucker Kraft also has seen an increase in attention because of his stellar play.\\nWicks again led the team in targets Sunday with seven, followed by Jayden Reed with six and Kraft with five.\\n'I think one thing that you totally respect about everybody is everybody has their own goals and aspirations and wants, but you just got to try to continue to keep it under what's best for our team,' LaFleur said. 'And ultimately, our job is to win football games and how we do that?\\n'Yeah, I would love everybody to go out there and get every number that they'd love to hit, but especially for myself and trying to set up this team, it's all about winning. We're fortunate that we have a lot of players that we have a lot of confidence in, and specifically on the offensive side of the ball in regards to trying to get everybody involved.\",\n",

Sign up here to get it sent to your inbox each morning.\\nComfortable fall weather should continue Tuesday with a high around 69 and partly sunny skies. The rest of the week looks pretty much the same, except for Friday, which is forecast to have a high around 78. We\\'ll see if that holds as the week continues.\\nFor years, John Heasley and other night sky enthusiasts in the region had dreamed of getting three public recreational areas — Wildcat Mountain State Park, the Kickapoo Valley Reserve and Tunnelville Cliffs State Natural Area — designated as an international dark sky park, a title that signifies excellent stewardship of the night sky and attracts star-seeking visitors interested in astronomy. Or just enjoying stars not visible when there is too much light. The measurements Heasley took in spring 2021 showed the skies were easily dark enough to qualify for the designation.\\nBut by fall 2023, that had changed, writes reporter Madeline Heim. His measurements found that sky brightness had increased by 50% or more in some areas — too bright to qualify.\\nHe and others believe the culprit is increased outdoor use of LED lights, which communities around the country are switching to en masse because they last longer and eat up less energy than traditional bulbs.\\nResearch is beginning to show that comes with a price: the bluer, brighter light that LEDs emit could be brightening the night sky by as much as 10% each year, one study found. And the impacts extend beyond stargazing. The brightness can disrupt the nighttime patterns of people and animals, which can have health consequences.\\nDomestic violence killings are among the most preventable types of homicide. But in Wisconsin, where domestic violence deaths remain high, funding to help victims is vanishing, writes reporter Ashley Luthern.\\nLast year, 85 people died in acts of domestic violence in Wisconsin, about one death every four days, according to a report released Tuesday by End Domestic Abuse Wisconsin. The report includes the deaths of perpetrators who died by suicide or law enforcement action.\\nAlthough it\\'s a decline from the 96 lives lost in 2022, it is still the second-highest annual total since the organization began recording data in 2000.\\nThe new report serves as a memorial to victims and a call to action with an introduction that reads, in part: \"Fund us, and we\\'ll save lives,\" and \"Survivors deserve better today, while they are still alive.\"\\nIn recent weeks, organizations across Wisconsin have been forced to lay off staff, cut hours and reduce services that help victims safety plan and access other resources.\\nSteve Martinez can be reached at steve.martinez@jrn.com.

       "   'summary': 'A toddler and a teenager are recovering in Texas after a roughly 2-minute dog attack left them with \"substantial\" injuries and psychological trauma, police said.\\nHeather Rodriguez, 36, was arrested on Monday morning after a preliminary investigation determined that she left her four XL American bullies alone with the 1-year-old boy she was in charge of babysitting and a 13-year-old girl, Bexar County Sheriff Javier Salazar said during a news conference.\\nWhile Rodriguez was gone from her Converse, Texas home for unknown reasons, the baby and young girl stayed in the bedroom to sequester themselves away from the dogs because they were \"known to cause damage,\" according to Salazar.\\nAt some point, the sheriff said the dogs forced themselves into the bedroom by destroying a connected bathroom door already damaged by the canines.\\nOnce in the bedroom, the dogs began biting the baby, Salazar said.\\n\"The 13-year-old was able to maintain control of the baby, but at this point, and what\\'s being described to me, it was almost a tug of war for the baby between at least one of the dogs and the little girl,\" according to the sheriff.\\nAs the back and forth for the baby was going on, additional dogs came into the room and joined the attack, Salazar said. The 13-year-old would spend \"several minutes trying to fight them off,\" leading to her being bitten in the process, the sheriff added.\\n\"At a certain point, she had to break away and physically left the baby behind in the bathroom,\" the sheriff said. (She was) being attacked while she went to go get her cell phone to call for help.\"\\nAfter the girl called 911, she took the baby into another bedroom where she barricaded the door, according to Salazar. The 13-year-old then used her body to prevent the dogs from coming into the bedroom, the sheriff added.\\nWhen deputies arrived, they came in, took control of the scene and began giving the baby first aid, Salazar said. Emergency responders then took the boy to a hospital.\\n\"From what we understand about the baby right now, he\\'s definitely in critical condition,\" according to the sheriff. \"I\\'ve actually seen some pictures of the baby from our body camera video... it\\'s heartbreaking to see anybody in that condition.\"\\nSalazar described the baby as having \"pretty severe head injuries\" and said his throat and airway were damaged to the point that he was not able to breathe normally. The baby\\'s parents, who told deputies they did not know Rodriguez\\'s dogs were \"problematic,\" reunited with their child at the hospital Monday morning, the sheriff said.\\n\"I\\'m led to believe they would not have let (Rodriguez) care for their baby the way that they did had they known that these dogs were unsafe,\" according to Salazar.\\nIn addition to being booked for felony injury to a child, Rodriguez was also cited for having her dogs run free without a leash, Salazar said. She could face additional charges for the injuries sustained by the teen, who deputies found inside the home covered in the baby boy\\'s blood, he added.\\n\"I\\'ve got to be honest, the 13-year-old in this instance, I\\'m considering her a hero,\" the sheriff said. \"I think her actions led to the baby not being mauled even more seriously, or even killed as a result of this savage dog attack.\"\\nChild Protective Services is involved in this case to ensure the baby is OK and to see if the 13-year-old \"is able to hold it together as a result of what she saw and experienced,\" according to the sheriff.\\n\"It\\'s certainly a heartbreaking situation for all,\" Salazar said.\\nIt is unclear if Rodriguez has legal representation yet.\\nAccording to the sheriff, at least two of the four dogs were primarily involved in the attack, but it is possible all of them participated in some capacity.\\n\"Obviously for me, any dog that took part in it needs to be put down,\" Salazar said. \"As heartbreaking as that sounds, the life of a little baby is much more important.\"\\nThe dogs are currently with Bexar County Animal Control, which will determine what happens to them, the sheriff said. He added how Rodriguez gave deputies a \"hard time\" when they came to take the dogs away.',\n",

       "   'summary': \"MADISON – Nolan Winter wanted a bigger role for the Wisconsin men's basketball team, so he started by building a bigger, better version of himself.\\nThe 6-foot-11 forward, who played in every game last season and averaged 2.4 points and 1.8 rebounds per game, added 15 pounds during the offseason to push his weight to 235 pounds.\\nThe native of Lakeville, Minnesota, also focused on sharpening the skills he'll need to play power forward, a position that would allow him to play alongside fifth-year senior Steven Crowl.\\nWinter talked about his weight-gain journey and the work he put into preparing for the season after practice last week.\\nWinter: I've been working on my body for that exact situation on the court. Me and Steve have been talking and working a lot, just one-on-one work all over the summer, so I think we're going to see a little bit of that during the winter. Throughout this whole summer I've been changing my body, just working, guarding the 4s, that kind of stuff. It's been good to work with him and get a feel for where he likes the ball and where I like it, playing in a tandem.\\nWinter: I put on about 15 pounds. I'm up to 230, 235. I came in around the summer at about 220, 222. It's a huge tribute to Coach (Jim) Snider in the weight room. Every day he has been helping me and we made that a point of emphasis, Even when I went home he gave me a schedule.\\nWinter: For sure. Just like guarding Steve. Last year he'd bury me. I'll be the first to admit it. But this year I can hold my ground a little bit better and I'm able to use that. I feel a little heavier out there, which is a good thing. That's why all over the summer I've been working on being able to guard the 4 with that weight on. It's been good being stronger, quicker.\\nWinter: Just putting on weight, honestly. I knew if I put on weight and got stronger it would help with quickness, speed, all sorts of stuff. That and my flexibility. I've got tight hips, so just working on that, getting lower on defense, guarding the perimeter, that's helped a lot.\\nWinter: I'm actually trying to make a little change to my shot. I've been one to use a thumb all my life, so throughout this summer me and Coach (Kirk) Penney have made it a point of emphasis of getting that off. Some days I'll be shooting it like crazy and some days it will be off. That comes with changing your shot a little bit. More recently it's felt a lot better and a lot more natural, so that's good. The season is coming around and the shot is starting to get here.\\nWinter: Putting the weight on makes you stronger and quicker so you're able to guard the 5, but with that you're able to guard the 4. Also going from a freshman to sophomore, just having that confidence in myself., like, 'OK, I've been here.' I got minutes against Big Ten opponents and just knowing I can compete with these guys. Going into my sophomore year it was a big goal for me to be able to guard the perimeter, so this whole summer that has a big emphasis for me. And just putting on weight. Being able to guard all positions I think is something God gifted me with with my size, my length and my athleticism. I'm trying to use that to the best of my abilities.\\nWinter: Being smart on the defensive end, being able to rotate, being in the right spots, I think that comes with rim protecting. Obviously I've got the length, I've got the wingspan, so for me it's being in the right spots off ball and I'm just there. ... If I'm able to jump well, it's a 7-footer going up with a 6-11 wingspan. It's tough for anyone to get over that, so it's not necessarily trying to block it (but) just being there and making it hard for the (shooter). Me and Coach Gard have talked about that. There is no reason I can't be one of the better shot blockers in the Big Ten just with my athleticism and my wingspan.\\nWinter: Yes, all summer I've worked on that with Coach Gard. I play the 5 obviously, but we're really trying to make me a 4 and I think I have it in me. Growing up playing elementary school, middle school, AAU, all sorts of stuff I've been a guard. I brought up the ball up. I've been a 1. I've controlled the offense. I know I've got it in me, it's just a matter of getting it out of me every day, which I know I can, I just have to consistently do it.\\nWinter: Honestly, I'm always trying to add weight. I'll take any weight I can get. Ever since I was young it's been hard for me to add weight, so I'll take everything I can get. But where I'm at right now I like where I'm at, and I think the coaches do, too. I've obviously added quite a bit of strength and they've noticed, too, and they've mentioned that.\",\n",

       "   'excerpt': 'Bucks head coach Doc Rivers provided updates on the future availability of Giannis Antetokounmpo, Khris Middleton and Gary Trent Jr.',\n",
       "   'summary': 'The Bucks practiced for the first time in Milwaukee on Tuesday afternoon following a weeklong opening to training camp in Irvine, California, and the preseason opener in Detroit on Sunday.\\nUnfortunately, the team already had to manage an injury to a key player, as starting shooting guard Gary Trent Jr. suffered a hyperextended left elbow in the third quarter of the Bucks loss to the Pistons.\\nTrent was screened by Pistons big man Jalen Duren in the third quarter and immediately grabbed his left arm and dropped to the court. He was then assisted to the locker room and did not return.\\nHe did not practice Tuesday, but Bucks head coach Doc Rivers said Trent did not need imaging on the elbow.\\n\\'He\\'ll be fine,\\' Rivers added. \\'He\\'ll probably play on Thursday. I can\\'t guarantee that, but I think so.\\'\\nTrent was the team\\'s top free-agent acquisition, surprisingly signing a one-year, veteran minimum contract after his three-year, $51.8 million deal with Toronto expired following last season. Originally a second-round pick of the Portland Trail Blazers in 2018, Trent was traded to Toronto during the 2020-21 season. In his three-plus seasons with the Raptors, the 25-year-old averaged 16.4 points per game on 38% three-point shooting.\\nNewly acquired forward Taurean Prince practiced Tuesday after he was screened illegally by Duren just before the Trent injury. Duren shoved an elbow into Prince\\'s midsection, sending the veteran to the floor briefly. Prince returned to the game and provided a defensive highlight by chasing down a turnover and blocking a Jaden Ivey dunk attempt at the rim.\\n\\'Just ill effects from calling illegal screens – there was a lot of that the other night,\\' Rivers said.\\nPrince said that he lost his breath briefly on the play.\\n\"I\\'m feeling good,\" he said. \"I wear padded tights so I just lost my breath. It wasn\\'t really the hit, it was just me losing my breath and trying to catch everything back.\"\\nRivers said the rest of the Bucks who played made it out of the Detroit game healthy.\\nBucks star Giannis Antetokounmpo did not play in the preseason opener, which Rivers said was planned. Antetokounmpo has not played in an exhibition opener since the truncated 2020 season.\\nThe forward is expected to suit up against the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday at Fiserv Forum and \\'then we\\'ll ramp his minutes up,\\' Rivers said.\\nOn a positive note, all-star Khris Middleton, who is slowly being worked back after offseason surgeries on both ankles, may play in the preseason.\\n\\'I do think maybe the last two (games), but there\\'s no guarantee there,\\' Rivers said.\\nThe emphasis of the Oct. 1-4 camp dates in California was largely to lay the foundation of a connected team, and Rivers said heading into the Detroit game the team had just started to install its offense.\\n\\'It\\'s slow because without Khris live (five-on-five) we\\'ve resisted putting in a lot of stuff because I want to put it in with him,\\' Rivers said. \\'So, we just kind of worked on what we\\'ve been working on a lot today.\\'\\nAdded Prince: \"I don\\'t think it\\'s going to be hard to get him in there. Granted, he\\'s been in a lot of drills. He\\'s been in a lot of practices. Very present. Asks his questions. So, with that being said I think it\\'ll be an easy transition for him and us. the only thing he doesn\\'t do is go live right now, but for us it\\'s really just concepts, knowing what we want to do, what we want to get to offensively.\"\\nBut with just two weeks before the team leaves for its season opener in Philadelphia on Oct. 23, Rivers said the emphasis of these practices is to fully roll out the playbook.\\n\\'We\\'re on schedule,\\' Rivers said. \\'We have time. I guess the best way to say it, we want to learn how to play first. And then once we learn how to play, it doesn\\'t matter what you put in. Then everything\\'s easy. We\\'re getting there.\\'\\nA league source confirmed the Bucks signed free-agent guard Terence Davis to an Exhibit 10 deal, which gives the team a chance to convert it to a two-way contract before the regular season begins. Davis, 27, ruptured an Achilles tendon on Jan. 4.\\nHoopsHype, a USA TODAY NETWORK property, reported the Bucks worked out the 6-foot-4 guard in August. Davis was an all-rookie second-team member with Toronto in 2019-20 and played four NBA seasons with the Raptors and Sacramento Kings, shooting 36.6% from behind the three-point line.\\nDavis was injured playing for the Portland G League team and told HoopsHype in January that he \\'turned down a good amount of money to play overseas in Greece, in the EuroLeague. I said no, as I want to get back in the NBA, and to stay in you have to play in the G League.\\'\\nThe Athletic initially reported Davis\\' signing.\\nIn a couple of small moves, the Wisconsin Herd acquired the returning player rights to center Liam Robbins and guard Sam Merrill. Robbins, a 25-year-old native of Waukesha who played collegiately at Drake, Minnesota and Vanderbilt, is on the Bucks training camp roster. The move allows the Herd to sign Robbins should he be waived.\\nThe 7-foot Robbins was the 2022-23 Southeastern Conference defensive player of the year but went undrafted after his season ended prematurely with a leg fracture. Robbins played for the New Orleans Pelicans G League affiliate in 2023 before suffering a season-ending injury there.\\nRobbins played nine minutes for the Bucks against the Pistons on Sunday and blocked three shots.\\nThe Herd also received the returning player rights to Merrill, a Cleveland Cavaliers guard who was part of the 2020-21 championship Bucks team. Merrill was initially drafted by New Orleans and came to Milwaukee along with Jrue Holiday. Merrill was also part of NBA history on Dec. 29, 2020, when he hit the Bucks\\' record 27th three-pointer of the night at Miami. The Bucks finished with 29 on the night.',\n",

On Saturday, an announcement was made during the Badgers game against Purdue that details about the stadium\\'s first concert in nearly 30 years would be revealed on Tuesday. But DJs during the game seemed to drop a hint when they played back-to-back Coldplay songs after the announcement.\\nAlso: Coldplay previously had teased on social media a tour announcement using abbreviations for different states, including Wisconsin — and the band last week held the world premiere of its latest album \"Moon Music\" in Wisconsin, at the Moon Saloon in the town of Moon, a couple of hours\\' drive north of the stadium.\\nOn Sunday night, the Badgers and Madison-based concert promoter FPC Live shared a video on its social media channels that flashed the band\\'s name and some of the band\\'s logos on video screens inside the empty stadium.\\nLast month, the stadium-dominant tour — named for Coldplay\\'s 2021 album — was proclaimed the top-selling and bestselling rock tour of all time. So far, it has grossed $945.7 million from 8.8 million tickets since it began in March 2022, according to Billboard.\\nBut a Coldplay tour hasn\\'t come through Wisconsin since July 25, 2009, when the band played Alpine Valley Music Theatre in East Troy behind 2008\\'s signature \"Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends.\" And the band has never played Madison before: The only places Coldplay has performed in Wisconsin are Alpine, and the Rave and Bradley Center in Milwaukee.\\nAlso featuring fellow original members Jonny Buckland, Guy Berryman and Will Champion, Coldplay will have plenty of music for Wisconsin fans to catch up on next year.

The failed bill aimed to shorten the timeframe for consideration of asylum claims, make it difficult for migrants to qualify and shut down processing of applications from people who crossed illegally.\\nThe Democratic vice presidential nominee said law enforcement not only supported but helped craft the bill, which he said would practically make a difference and \"adhere to what we know as American principles.\"\\n\"I don\\'t talk about my faith a lot, but Matthew 25:40 talks about, \\'To the least amongst us, you do unto me,\\'\" Walz said. \"Americans, they simply want order to it.

Vance emphasized that in order to address the crisis, law enforcement needs the president to empower agents to do their job.\\n\"You\\'ve got housing that is totally unaffordable because we have illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes,\" Vance said. \"It is a disgrace, Tim, and I actually think I agree with you.

They\\'re also joining President Joe Biden in urging lawmakers to consider an emergency session before Election Day to get their work done.\\nIn a letter to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the Democratic and Republican senators from North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Tennessee and Virginia wrote that the damage wrought by the hurricane will be at least in the tens of billions of dollars.\\n\"Although the true level of devastation is still unfolding, it is clear that Congress must act to meetthe unmet needs in our states and address the scope and scale of destruction experienced by ourconstituents,\" the senators wrote. \"This may even require Congress to come back in October to ensure we have enough time to enact legislation before the end of this calendar year.\"\\nAt least 144 people have been killed by the storm, including 64 in North Carolina, 36 in South Carolina, 25 in Georgia, 11 in Florida, six in Tennessee and two in Virginia, according to a USA TODAY analysi s. Hundreds of others remain missing amid power outages, destroyed roadways, flooding and crushed buildings.\\nCongress is scheduled to be out of session until at least Nov. 12. But lawmakers from affected states in both chambers have been urging their colleagues to come back to Washington to approve additional funds to help address the fall out.\\nBiden approved disaster declarations for Florida and North Carolina on Sunday. On Monday, he said he is likely to ask Congress for additional funding for the affected states, calling it a \"historic storm,\" and that he may call lawmakers back to Washington to approve it.\\nBut House Speaker Mike Johnson appeared to throw cold water on that idea Tuesday during remarks to the New York Stock Exchange.\\n\\'Congress has previously provided the funds it [FEMA] needs to respond, so we will make sure that those resources are appropriately allocated,\\' Johnson said, referencing the government funding extension passed last week, funding the government through Dec. 20.\\nThat package includes $20 billion of funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and a mechanism for the agency to spend it quickly. However that is an extension of current funding levels, rather than additional funding for disaster relief programs.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'Beyoncé Knowles Carter and fans all over social media have been boasting about the singer\\'s new SirDavis Whisky, so it only seemed fitting to put the award-wining liquor to a taste test.\\nThe Tennessean\\'s Senior Dining Reporter Mackensy Lunsford and Beyoncé Reporter Caché McClay took a bottle of SirDavis to a longtime expert in Nashville — a place known not only for country music but also whiskey.\\nMatt Bolus, a chef and restaurateur at 404 Kitchen and Gertie\\'s Whiskey Bar, has been in the whiskey business for decades. Born in Kentucky and raised in Tennessee, he says whiskey has been in his blood for as long as he can remember and it\\'s become a passion.\\nBetween the Gertie\\'s location in Louisville and the one in Nashville, Bolus says the bar houses around 1,000 labels.\\nTogether we tried the superstar\\'s new whiskey and heard Bolus\\' review of the $89.99 bottle.\\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\\nBolus likes to take a whiff of a whiskey before he sips it, looking for subtle notes that might belie the mash bill, or the combination of grains used to make it.\\n\"We could have three different whiskeys in front of us and smell them all, and at first you\\'ll get a little bit of difference but eventually they\\'re all going to smell the same,\" he explains. \"So if you smell your hand or arm first, (it will) reset your nose and you\\'ll notice the difference.\"\\nHe also noted it was important to open your mouth slightly while taking in the aroma to fully grasp what you\\'re smelling.\\nBolus immediately detected the smell of rye and \"sweeter\" warming spices similar to cinnamon and star anise, which he says is typical of rye. The barley adds \"a richer background note,\" he says.\\nAfter finally giving SirDavis a taste he says, \"Initially, I\\'m getting the barely, the malted grains, the toastiness, the wood. I\\'m getting a bit of cherry — that raisin-y flavor.\"\\nBolus was pleasantly surprised by how much he enjoyed SirDavis, saying it was not too sweet but had a perfect balance of flavors.\\n\"It\\'s complex and the more I taste it and the more I smell it, the more complex it gets,\" he says.\\nBolus says he would recommend SirDavis to drinkers who prefer scotch over bourbon or rye.\\n\"I\\'d probably steer them to something like this and say try this, this is getting into the American whiskey side,\" he says.\\nAnd Queen Bey knows all about Tennessee whiskey herself. In a recent interview with GQ magazine, the \"Cowboy Carter\" creator made sure to highlight Nearest Green and his influence on Tennessee whiskey and the industry as a whole.\\n\"She\\'s put her name on something and has a reason behind it and actually has a great product behind it,\" Bolus says. \"I\\'m not drinking Beyoncé\\'s whiskey just to say it\\'s Beyoncé\\'s whiskey. ... It\\'s actually delicious.\"\\nShe recently shared on social media her Parisian celebration of her new spirit brand with husband Jay-Z and their famous friends.\\nAs fans know, Beyoncé recently announced her new liquor brand crafted in partnership with Moët Hennessy and celebrated master distiller Bill Lumsden. It is named after her great-grandfather Davis Hogue, who was a successful moonshiner in the American South during Prohibition.\\nIn a letter penned to him, she writes, \"I feel you in the landscapes. Your laughter rolling in the rye. What songs did you sing? What gaps did you fill? Great-grandfather, did you dream of me? Your legacy is a force that drives me.\" She added, \"For you, I raise my glass to legacy.\"',\n",

If the affordable Ford Maverick has reminded us in America of the strong appeal of truly compact trucks, the bare-bones IMV 0/Hilux Champ reminds us that ultra-basic doesn't have to be a bummer. What is a bummer is that the little Champ will never be federalized for sale here. It's a loss-leaser for ASEAN markets, a vehicle to sell upfits for (and to sell to upfitters). The fruits of that strategy are coming to light with this adorable and desirable little Carryboy Hilux Champ Motorhome, a tidy camper with a rugged charm. But you (still) can't buy one.\\nUnless you live in Thailand or thereabouts. Carryboy is a Thai upfitter that normally produces truck-based RVs on the regular Toyota Hilux and Mitsubishi Triton pickups. The layouts on these look generous given the midsize trucks the camper is built into, with a sizable sleeper dinette, and enclosed toilet and a few neat features like a flip-open clear roof panel called the Skyview. Airline-style overhead storage compartments help with organization, and up front there's an over-the-cab berth. The larger Motorhomes will sleep up to 6 and, were they to be installed on a USDM truck, look perfectly appropriate to North American tastes.\\nCamper vans: Is this the next step for the legendary Mitsubishi Delica?\\nThe Hilux Champ Motorhome is a little more compact, which makes sense given the smaller platform. It also has a chunkier look which perfectly matches the Hilux Champ's bulldog-ish front end. The interior looks much like the larger Carryboy Motorhomes, but the company says the Hilux Champ version still sleeps six. The standard version has the Skyview panel, a 500-watt solar roof, electric awning and electric deployable steps, a built-in utility box at the rear and an included 3,300-watt generator. The interior has the dinette, a couch, cabinet with a TV on top and a fully enclosed toilet/shower combo. The Carryboy Hilux Champ Motorhome carries 120 liters of fresh water and has 9,600 wH of battery capacity. You can option an air conditioner, slide-out kitchen, AC Power air suspension and a later 28,800 Wh battery.\\nThis seems to be a semi-official conversion, and is also sold through Toyota dealerships in Thailand. The total cost comes out to about $60,400 at current conversion rates, and it uses a definitely-not-intended-for-us 2.4-liter diesel engine. The Hilux Champ starts at $17,530 in Thailand. The HIlux Champ was never designed for nor intended for North America, and there's zero chance this generation would ever be sold here, but this little motorhome sure makes us wistful for a sub-Tacoma compact Toyota pickup with a pugnacious look and a fun camper grafted onto the back. After all, surely the Ford Maverick's done well enough for Toyota to start doing its market research into the segment, hasn't it? Until then, we're jealous.\",\n",

Now, a team from the Air/Sea Heritage Foundation, NOAA\\'s Office of National Marine Sanctuaries, the Naval Heritage and History Command, the marine technology company Ocean Infinity and the maritime archaeology foundation Search Inc. have found the wreckage of the vessel off the coast of Northern California.\\n\"Whether lost in battle or sunk as a target, a warship remains sovereign property in perpetuity,\" Rear Admiral Samuel J. Cox USN (Ret), the Director of Naval History and Heritage Command, and Curator for the US Navy, said in response to the discovery. \"It is important to know the location and condition of such wrecks so that they may be protected from unauthorized disturbance under the US Sunken Military Craft Act.\"\\nFinding the wreckage\\nThree underwater autonomous vehicles from Ocean Infinity were launched Aug. 1 to conduct a day-long scan of the ocean floor using sonar and multibeam echosounder systems. Analyzing the data collected revealed the unmistakable image of a ship – the USS Stewart – resting on the seafloor at a depth of about 3,500 feet.\\n\"Preliminary sonar scans revealed that the Stewart is largely intact and that its hull – which remainssleek and imposing – rests nearly upright on the seafloor,\" a statement from the search team said. \"This level of preservation is exceptional for a vessel of its age and makes it potentially one of the best-preserved examples of a US Navy \\'fourstacker\\' destroyer known to exist.\"\\nAfter the initial discovery of the wreckage, the search team conducted visual inspection using a remote-operated vehicle equipped with a camera.\\n\\'The USS Stewart represents a unique opportunity to study a well-preserved example of early twentieth-century destroyer design,\" Search Inc. senior vice president Dr. James Delgado said.\\nThe USS Stewart\\'s unique history\\nOf the thousands of Navy ships in service during World War II, the USS Stewart may have one of the most unusual histories of all.\\nCommissioned in 1920, the ship was stationed in the Philippines as part of the U.S. Navy\\'s Asiatic Fleet by the time of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Damaged in combat in February 1942, the ship was undergoing repairs at the island of Java when the crew was forced to abandon it ahead of advancing Japanese forces.\\nAfter being raised and repaired, the ship was pressed into service with the Imperial Japanese Navy. There, the occasional sighting of the destroyer – with its distinctly American design – operating behind enemy lines earned it the \"ghost ship\" moniker.\\nIn 1945, as Japan was occupied at the end of World War II, the ship was found afloat at Kure, Japan.\\nRecommissioned once more as the USS Stewart, the old destroyer was towed back to San Francisco and sunk the next year as a target ship.\\n\"Its story, from US Navy service to Japanese capture and back again, makes it a powerful symbol ofthe Pacific War\\'s complexity,\" Delgado said.',\n",

Vanderbilt did not have a game last week and previously lost to Missouri on the road in its conference opener.\\nOn Saturday (3:15 p.m. CT, SEC Network), the Commodores will face a long losing streak, with 14 straight losses in the series, and 24 straight if you take the original result of a retroactively forfeited game.\\nVanderbilt lost, 55-3, in 2022 and has not scored a touchdown against the Crimson Tide since 2007 (the two teams have only played three times since then).\\nThe Commodores will also be without defensive end Zaylin Wood for a second straight game due to injury.\\nHere's what to know about the matchup:\\nVanderbilt football history vs Alabama\\nVanderbilt is 19-62-4 against Alabama all time. In the record books, the Commodores' last win was in 1993. However, that was a game Vanderbilt originally lost but was later awarded a win via forfeit when the Crimson Tide used an ineligible player. The last win on the field for the Commodores in the series was a 30-21 victory in 1984, and the last Vanderbilt victory in Nashville was in 1969.\\nAlabama's big win vs Georgia\\nAlabama's matchup last weekend with then-No. 1 Georgia came with heavy fanfare. The Crimson Tide got off to a 28-0 start, but the Bulldogs mounted a comeback in the second half and even took the lead at one point before Alabama came back to win.\\nIt's possible that the Crimson Tide could face a bit of a letdown game, but Vanderbilt isn't factoring that into its preparations.\\nJalen Milrose isn't Alabama's only top 2025 NFL Draft prospect\\nLed by quarterback Jalen Milroe, Alabama has five top-100 prospects for the 2025 NFL Draft, according to Pro Football Focus. That list also includes three offensive linemen and a safety.\\nMilroe is also one of the favorites for the Heisman Trophy, with 964 passing yards and 10 touchdowns to go along with 273 rushing yards and eight touchdowns.\\nVanderbilt score prediction vs Alabama\\nAlabama 48, Vanderbilt 14: There are a few games on Vanderbilt's schedule that are a big uphill battle, and this is one of them.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued a recall notification for over 27,000 Tesla Cybertrucks for a rearview camera that may fail to display.\\nTesla is recalling 27,185 of its 2024 Cybertruck vehicles. In the NHTSA report the automotive company said that 'the rearview camera image may be delayed after shifting into reverse.' If a rearview image is delayed or does not display, it can fail to show what is behind the driver's vehicle. This issue can increase the risk of a crash, the report said.\\nIn addition, the NHTSA said that the Tesla Cybertruck 'fail to comply with the requirements of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) number 111, 'Rear Visibility.''\\nTo fix the issue, Tesla has released an over-the-air software update for owners with the effected vehicles. This service will be completed for free. Recall notification letters are expected to be sent by Nov. 25. Owners may contact Tesla customer service at 1-877-798-3752. Tesla's number for this recall is SB-24-00-016.\\nRecalled vehicles:\\n2024 Tesla Cybertruck\\nTesla Cybertruck also subject of two recalls recently\\nIn August, the NHTSA announced that the 2024 Tesla Cybertruck was being recalled because a truck bed trim may detach and a front windshield wiper failure.\\nIn the NHTSA report, the automotive company recalled 11,383 Cybertrucks and said the trunk bed trim sail applique could have been improperly adhered and could loosen. If the vehicle has a loose applique, it can detach from the vehicle. When this happens it can create a road hazard for other drivers and increase the risk of a crash.\\nFor the front windshield wiper failure, Tesla recalled 11,688 of its Cybertruck vehicles. The automotive company said the excessive electrical current can cause the front windshield wiper motor controller to fail. A windshield wiper that fails can reduce a driver's visibility and increase the risk of a crash, per the NHTSA report submitted in June.\\nRecall notification letters were scheduled to be mailed out on Aug. 18, the reports said.\\nCheck to see if your car is recalled\\nAre you looking to see if any recalls were issued on your vehicle? If the car isn't listed below, owners can check USA TODAY's automotive recall database or search NHTSA's database for new recalls. The NHTSA website allows you to search for recalls based on your vehicle identification number or VIN.\",\n",

       "   'excerpt': \"Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance showed he is not Trump during his debate performance, but that he'll say and do anything for Trump.\",\n",
       "   'summary': \"Last night's vice-presidential debate started a bit rocky for Democrats. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, with all his small-town, football-coach geniality, seemed rattled by the bigger stage and brighter lights, by the knowledge that tens of millions of people would be watching his every move.\\nBut while Walz's early moves were shaky, those of Ohio Sen. JD Vance, former President Trump's new running mate, were decidedly steady. Assured.\\nSome folks online likened Vance's debate performance to that of a used car salesman or, really, any professional who's trained to manipulate with their words. Regardless, Vance was largely effective, at least in the beginning. He used tactical verve to address the gaping chasms in his party's platform, assuaging doubt with empathy and affirmation.\\n'I think that what I take from that as a Republican who proudly wants to protect innocent life in this country, who proudly wants to protect the vulnerable, is that my party, we've got to do so much better of a job at earning the American people's trust back on this issue where they, frankly, just don't trust us,' Vance said on the issue of abortion. 'That's one of the things that Donald Trump and I are endeavoring to do. I want us as a Republican Party to be pro-family in the fullest sense of the word.'\\nVance positioned himself as the opposite of Trump's caustic personality\\nIt was as if Vance had vowed to singlehandedly prove that the 2024 Republican ticket isn't all callousness, condescension, and lies. And if the issue with Trump is a matter of diminishing electability via absent respectability, Vance was, it seemed, the perfect surrogate.\\nEven while bludgeoning his point that Vice President Kamala Harris's ability to effectively navigate the border crisis should be measured by her refusal to do so during the nearly four years she's been in office, Vance was charismatic and engaging, acknowledging that he believes Walz generally wants to fix the problem.\\nOn the matter of gun violence, he even expressed compassion when Walz mentioned that his son had witnessed a shooting at a local rec center.\\nTaken together, it was a noted, and welcome, departure from the standard ugliness of a Trump debate.\\nIt was also, perhaps, the best presentation of the Trump-led Republican Party as a group of sensible people who happen to fall to the right on policy but who ultimately desire to find a workable middle ground for all Americans.\\nIt's what folks of all political stripes have been begging for.\\nIn the end, though, Vance refused to address Trump's election lies\\nBut then came the topic of democracy — specifically, Trump's refusal to acknowledge the results of the 2020 election, despite it being certified by all 50 states.\\nIt was the moment that jostled viewers back to reality, lending needed context to everything that came before and reminding voters who are caught in that very messy middle of our political divide just who — and what — is on the ballot this November.\\nIf the first two-thirds of the debate was an attempt to sway undecideds and win back some of the voters under the GOP umbrella who've long grown tired of Trump's antics and divisiveness, the latter portion was a circling of the same rickety wagons. It was, in fact, a reminder that no matter how smart and polished and compassionate Vance appeared, he is not running for president.\\nTrump is.\\nAnd in his 'damning non-answer' to Walz's direct question about whether Trump lost in 2020, Vance proved that, at the end of every single day in office, no matter how far Trump would be willing to stray from the principles holding this country together (however tenuously), Vance would be willing to follow.\",\n",

He began selling fresh baked bread in his home before planning the new eatery.\\nEmeraude is French for emerald — a nod to the prominent green color favored by his late 'paw paw' Leon Stilley that is used in logo designs for both eateries. Stilley was known for writing letters of encouragement with green pens.\\nBriley and chef Nick Guidry co-own Leon's Famous Deli, which opened in April. Guidry and his wife Audra own Pelican & Pig and Slow Hand Coffee in East Nashville.\\nBriley began making sourdough bread about 18 months ago at his home and his list of customers grew to about 140 loaves per week.\\n'Traditional old-world sourdough that takes about three days to make,' Briley said of his primary bread that is organic and made with technique and time. 'I've always been interested in bread and the chemistry behind it.'\\nBesides the classic sourdough bread, Briley will offer different bread and pastry flavors on certain days. Plans are for a neon sign in front that will indicate when fresh hot bread is available.\\nOn Saturdays, the bakery will offer 'an old-school bake shop' with furniture for a living room feel and menu options like cinnamon rolls and croissants. Briley has partnered with Nespresso.\\nAt some point after opening, Briley hopes to develop an outdoor patio area.\\nThe Emeraude Bakery also plans to have a locker system where customers will be able to pick up orders after hours.

A defender's stick made contact with Forsberg's skate, upending him just as he tried to find a teammate.\\nBut as he was falling backward, Forsberg managed to smack the puck, while suspended in the air, right on to the blade of a streaking Nyquist.\\nNyquist then buried the shot by goaltender Yaniv Perets.\\nThe balance and coordination to make a pass like this is something not every player can do. We've grown accustomed to seeing Forsberg pull nifty moves with the puck over the years — between-the-legs goals, flipped pucks to himself on the rush — but nothing quite like this.\\nAs coach Andrew Brunette continues to work newcomers Steven Stamkos and Marchessault into the offense, he'll rely on Forsberg to build on last season. Forsberg's 48-goal output broke the franchise record for single-season goals, surpassing Matt Duchene's 43-goal season in 2022.\\nThe Predators have two more preseason games. The next is Saturday at Bridgestone Arena, where they face the Hurricanes at 4 p.m. CT. They finish the preseason on the road at Tampa on Oct. 7, a makeup game from the postponement due to Hurricane Helene.\",\n",

       "   'excerpt': \"Don't call it a recall, but Toyota will replace the eight-speed transmissions in certain Tacomas.\",\n",
       "   'summary': \"If you frequently visit Toyota forums, then you probably noticed that a not insignificant number of owners of the new 2024 Toyota Tacoma have been complaining about transmission gremlins. It seems like the problem has been specific to those who opted for the eight-speed automatic transmission. Having a bad gearbox in a brand-new truck is surely frustrating.\\nToyota is officially recognizing the issue and is doing something about it, sort of. According to a report from CarScoops, Toyota is offering to replace faulty eight-speed transmissions in 2024 model-year Toyota Tacoma trucks, though this isn't a safety 'recall,' but rather a technical service bulletin that's been issued to dealers. Toyota isn't considering this a safety issue and is not replacing transmissions on all Tacomas, only those that have already broken.\\nFurthermore, in order to qualify for the fix, your Tacoma must display one or more of six specific fault codes when its onboard diagnostic system is scanned at a dealership.\\nFor reference these are the fault codes in question:\\nP07407F\\nP079571\\nP08BA71\\nP271371\\nP280771\\nP281671\\nJudging by the codes, which have surfaced on a forum, it would seem that the cause of the issue is a stuck pressure control solenoid actuator, or a torque converter clutch actuator being frozen in the off position. If your Tacoma displays one of the codes, Toyota will replace the entire transmission and torque converter assembly.\\nChevrolet trucks and SUVs: Want to use Google Maps? It'll cost you an extra $300 per year\\nTrucks with the manual transmission aren't affected by this problem, so if you have three pedals in your Tacoma you can rest easy. If you own one of the affected trucks, then at least you know a fix is coming. The question is how widespread the problem is, and how long will it take dealers to fix it. Replacing a transmission isn't a quick job, even with experienced techs that have all the proper tools. We recommend reaching out to your local dealer ASAP before a long queue develops.\\nPotential transmission problems aside, when we first drove the 2024 Toyota Tacoma, we were highly impressed. We found it to be a huge upgrade over the previous model, while keeping the character that Tacomas are known for. We would still recommend the truck, though it's worth maybe waiting until Toyota sorts out this transmission thing or better yet, opting for the truck's manual transmission, a fast-disappearing option on midsize trucks generally.\",\n",

       "   'excerpt': 'Since Trent Dilfer left Lipscomb Academy football after back-to-back state titles for a college team at UAB, both programs have fallen on hard times.',\n",
       "   'summary': \"Checking in on our old pal Trent Dilfer in the college football ranks: It's not going well.\\nOn Saturday, after Dilfer's UAB team fell to 1-3 with a 41-18 home defeat to Navy, the outspoken former Lipscomb Academy coach made a bad time worse with a quip during his postgame news conference. In inviting his grandson to join him in front of the room, Dilfer noted the absence of media members, with only two being in attendance to ask questions.\\n'It's like two of them. It's not like this is freakin' Alabama. Let's go,' said Dilfer, comparing the informality of his surroundings at UAB to Kalen DeBoer's over in Tuscaloosa.\\nDilfer wasn't wrong. It was, however, stunningly tone-deaf for a UAB coach to so casually — and so pointlessly — highlight inferiority with the one program sure to strike a nerve with fans of his own. Dilfer could have said Michigan or Notre Dame or the New York Yankees, and he'd be making the same point.\\nBut UAB's grudge with 'UAT' goes back well before Dilfer arrived after the 2022 season. Both are under the purview of the state university system's board of trustees, which has and will always care about the fortunes of one football team. (Hint: It's not UAB.)\\nThe Blazers shut down their football program in 2014 before returning in 2017 and enjoying immediate success under former coach Bill Clark, who was responsible for one of the most underrated coaching efforts in college football history, going 11-3 in 2018.\\nLast season, UAB began playing in the American Athletic Conference alongside some respected programs — Memphis, for instance — who'll be eyeing that final spot in the College Football Playoff.\\nUAB could be one of those teams. It has more going for it than you might think: A downtown campus, new stadium, nice facilities, a strong recruiting base in a football-crazy state. There's potential in UAB football. There's pride, too. That's why it was resurrected.\\nBut, no, it's not freakin' Alabama.\\nMemphis football isn't freakin' Tennessee, either, but how do you think it'd go over if Tigers coach Ryan Silverfield pointed that out? And Silverfield's record at Memphis is 35-19.\\nDilfer is 5-11 at UAB.\\nSince Dilfer departed for UAB after leading Lipscomb Academy to national prominence and back-to-back Division II-AA state titles, it's gone badly for both programs.\\nLipscomb Academy's stature has plummeted, not just with losses, but last year's eligibility scandal that resulted in a postseason ban and the departure of Dilfer's successor, Kevin Mawae, who went 4-6 in his only season at the school.\\nUAB, meanwhile, gambled on a former NFL quarterback from the high school ranks, choosing a celebrity coach to help boost the program's profile. Episodes like Saturday's, along with Dilfer's record, are creating an impression they've got the celebrity without enough of the coaching.\\nDilfer's personality is a lot. He's entertaining. He talks a great game. He's willing to say anything and isn't worried about angering others. Didn't endear him to many high school coaches in Middle Tennessee, though it did help make him a good ESPN analyst.\\nThat remark Saturday, though, came across as condescending. Like someone who felt too good for UAB, even though he'd just lost a game by 23 points.\\nTwo days later, Dilfer was asked by a media member to clarify.\\nHe asked the reporter if he'd been there Saturday. He had not.\\n'There's my answer,' Dilfer said, per video posted by UAB. 'There were two people there, OK? And my grandson wanted to come up, and I heard like a little stirring, and I said, 'There's two people here. This isn't freakin' Alabama's press conference.''\\nLike I said, it's not going well.\\nMakes me wonder how much longer Dilfer will be at UAB. Kind of like it also makes me wonder how long it'll take for Dilfer to confront one of his players for a lack of effort, only to get a disinterested shrug in response:\\nIt's not like this is freakin' Alabama, Coach.\",\n",

       "   'summary': 'To Sherman Holt, the mountains of western North Carolina are all connected. From Swain County to Buncombe County to Yancey County, the people of the region abide by the same rule: when your neighbors are in need, you provide help.\\nOn Monday, Holt and the Swain County football team went through Bryson City, the county seat, shoveling dirt and mud off the sidewalks and picking up and hauling off trash and flood-damaged furniture. On Wednesday, the team drove east to Haywood County, where they cleaned debris, distributed water and cooked hot dogs and hamburgers for more than 600 residents of Maggie Valley.\\n\"We were throwing gallons of water across a creek to people because they can\\'t get out (of their houses), and they don\\'t have water, they don\\'t have food,\" said Holt, coach of the Maroon Devils. \"It\\'s just an eye-opening, humbling experience to go into places that we grew up, lived and call home.\"\\nOutside of the area near the Tuckasegee River, Bryson City escaped major damage from Tropical Storm Helene. People from harder-hit communities have been coming in to pick up supplies. Holt, whose team\\'s game Friday at Andrews is on as scheduled, recognizes the disparity. He, like a large number of high school coaches across the state, is doing what he can to aid the recovery in places that weren\\'t as fortunate as his.\\n\"What we\\'re trying to do in Swain is just give people hope and let people know that we\\'re here to help them and that they\\'re not alone,\" Holt said.\\nFootball teams are delivering supplies, collecting donations to WNC\\nOn Saturday, Central Cabarrus coach Zach Bevilacqua saw a Facebook post from East Henderson coach Colton Brackett, detailing how a shelter in Hendersonville was running out of supplies.\\nBevilacqua was doing yard work when his son, a junior on his team, asked him if he was going to go to Hendersonville. Brandon Bevilacqua told his father that players were going door-to-door in Concord, asking for money to buy water. Zach sent a message to his team, telling them that he and defensive line coach Preston Davis would load up his truck and drive to Hendersonville, about two hours west. About 10 players and their parents showed up to transport food, baby wipes and 40 gallons of water to the shelter.\\nThrough coaching, which to him is \"one big fraternity,\" Bevilacqua has contacts all over the state, and this week is trying to serve smaller communities in and around Asheville. The Vikings are filling their assistant coaches\\' 26-foot enclosed trailer with supplies, while the Central Cabarrus booster club set up a Square account for people to donate money in lieu of goods.\\n\"I spoke with a couple of coaches, just told them I was thinking about them, and they came back saying it\\'s a whole lot worse than you realize,\" Bevilacqua said. \" . . . I talked to my team about that a good bit. Like, we\\'re getting ready for games and some of these kids and coaches have nothing. Their houses are gone. Everything they own is gone.\"\\nPrograms in North Carolina\\'s major metropolis areas — Charlotte, Raleigh, Winston-Salem — and as far out as the Outer Banks have set up various ways to provide relief. West Stokes and South Mecklenburg players have been collecting donations at their stadiums every afternoon since Monday. North Forsyth fans can receive free admission to all athletic events this week by bringing five non-perishable food items. Mount Tabor, Willow Spring and Davie County are just a few of the schools collecting water, hygiene products, sunscreen, cleaning supplies and other items at their games this week.\\n\"I believe in doing what\\'s right,\" Bevilacqua said. \"I think that this is what\\'s right.\"\\nHow high school teams aiding relief efforts in East Tennessee\\nAcross the North Carolina- Tennessee border, a fierce rivalry became something more this week.\\nAnderson County and Greeneville have met in the playoffs six of the past seven seasons and developed plenty of mutual respect during that time. So when the Anderson County administration found out the extent of damage in Greeneville, which lacks running water, the next steps were obvious.\\nAlumnus Michael Malicote recently donated a tractor trailer to the Mavericks\\' football program, which they\\'ve used to take their equipment to road games this season. Anderson County decided to use the trailer to deliver water to Greeneville, and athletic director and assistant coach Gary Terry put out the call for donations.\\nTerry thought it might take a week to solicit that much in donations, but Anderson County reached that goal in 24 hours. On Monday, the trailer took 20 pallets of water to Greeneville, and Terry hoped to make two more deliveries by week\\'s end.\\n\"The community support\\'s phenomenal, it\\'s been from all over the place,\" Terry said. \"We\\'ll take it up there till they don\\'t need it, and take it someplace else if we have to. . . . We said, we gotta help these guys out. It\\'s bigger than football.\"',\n",

These defective parts were prone to failure and resulted in \"economic damages\" to owners of the affected vehicles through repairs and remedies, according to the lawsuit.\\nAs part of the agreement, General Motors denies any wrongdoing.

These include:\\nPeople who paid out of pocket for a CP4 repair that was not covered by warranty. $30 million will be set aside for this group and payments could range from $6,356 to $12,712.\\nPeople who no longer own their trucks and did not pay out of pocket for a CP4 repair. $5 million will be set aside for this fund and individual payments could range from $400 to $800.\\nThose who still own trucks that have not been remedied. These people can get cash back on future repairs and will be reimbursed 50% of the costs paid for a CP4 repair performed at a GM-authorized dealership on or after the date the settlement receives final approval. This reimbursement option will end 12 months after the settlement\\'s final approval or when the truck reaches 200,000 miles.\\nPeople unsure if they are entitled to a payout can use a provided VIN lookup tool on the litigation website.\\nTo get a cash payment, you can file a claim online or turn to email or phone.\\nFile a claim form online at www.GMFuelPumpLitigation.com.\\nDownload a claim form or request one by calling 1-866-848-0815 or emailing info@GMFuelPumpLitigation.com\\nTo receive repair reimbursement in the future, you must get or pay for a CP4 repair or replacement at a GM-authorized dealership on or after the settlement\\'s final approval date.

       "   'summary': 'Sections of Interstate 40 are still impassable and some areas are just completely gone. It will take a while to make repairs to the interstate, but it might not be as long as Google is predicting.\\nThe remnants of Hurricane Helene brought inches of rain to Western North Carolina causing the maze of rivers in the mountains to burst from their banks, washing away roads and bridges that once led people on picturesque drives through the state and into Tennessee. Now debris and mud have blocked connections to these small towns as the slow process of cleaning up and digging out continues.\\nHow long that process will take is unknown at this point as roads are being assessed, so a Google Maps alert that it will take until 2025 for the section of I-40 at the North Carolina-Tennessee border might be a bit too soon.\\nWhen will I-40 be open?\\n\"In general, we\\'re going to prioritize the interstates and U.S. and N.C. routes ahead of the secondary routes, but also we\\'ve got to look at how much damage we have, like … the one near the Tennessee line,\" N.C. Department of Transportation Joey Hopkins said Oct. 1. \"That\\'s a significant amount of damage and so even though it\\'s a top priority of ours, it will take a long time to fix that. We\\'re probably talking months at best. We\\'ve still got to evaluate that and do some assessments out there before we can determine what that solution is.\"\\nA mudslide resulted in a partial collapse of the I-40 in North Carolina along the border line with Tennessee. Tennessee Department of Transportation and NCDOT are working together to assess the extent of the damage on their respective sides of I-40. Neither had a timeline of when the highly traveled section bridging the two states would be open again, as of Tuesday, Oct. 1.\\nThe repairs needed to I-40 will take \"months\" at a minimum, according to NCDOT.\\nWhat section of I-40 is closed?\\nOn Tuesday, I-40 was reopened east of Asheville, but I-40 at mile marker 3 in Haywood County will remain closed indefinitely.\\nBoth I-40 East and West are closed from mile marker 432 in Tennessee east to mile marker 3 in North Carolina. I-40 West is closed starting at mile marker 3 in North Carolina west through mile marker 435 in Tennessee, according to TDOT.\\nAlternate routes around I-40 closure\\nWhile the major thoroughfare is closed for the foreseeable future, there are ways around it.\\nInterstate 81 offers a bypass to I-40. Those in the Northwest section of Western North Carolina, can look for a safe route to I-81 into Tennessee which connects with Interstate 77, providing an alternate route to other areas in North Carolina.\\nThose in the Southwest part of the state can still travel on part of Interstate 26, but sections of the road may be closed. People can also seek out safe routes to Interstate 85 and then head Northbound to the Charlotte area.\\nThose south of Hendersonville can take U.S. 74 ALT to U.S. 74 East toward Shelby and then connect with I-85 to Charlotte and other points North and East.\\nU.S. 64 to U.S. 74 ALT just north of Hendersonville is impassable at this time due to landslides. The road is also impassable between U.S. 74 ALT and Slick Rock Road according to NCDOT.\\nCurrent N.C. DOT Road closure map\\nThere may be closed roads not listed on DriveNC.gov as many areas are not able to report at this time, according to NCDOT.\\nYou can follow road closures at drivenc.gov.\\nCan I go to Western NC to help?\\nAll of Western North Carolina roads are to be considered closed to non-emergency traffic, according to multiple officials including N.C. Gov. Roy Cooper. North Carolina Department of Transportation crews are still working to clear many roads in that part of the state so that much-needed supplies can get to communities that have been isolated since Friday.',\n",

The person briefed on the matter spoke on the condition of anonymity.\\nThe person added that the timing of any Israeli strike has also not yet been decided but was expected to be \"soon\" and would likely not wait for the Jewish holiday Rosh Hashanah to conclude.\\nThat holiday runs from sundown on Wednesday until sundown on Friday.\\nAttacking Iran\\'s oil facilities would hurt regular citizens, a move Israel largely has avoided to keep the focus on the country\\'s leadership, according to a separate U.S. official who discussed potential targets on condition of anonymity.\\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran \"made a big mistake\" by attacking Israel.\\n\"They will understand,\" he said. \"We will stand by the rule we established: whoever attacks us, we will attack them.\"\\nIran said it fired its missiles at Israel in retaliation for Israel\\'s killing of Hassan Nasrallah and other top Lebanon-based Hezbollah leaders. Most of Iran\\'s missiles were intercepted with help from the U.S. military. A Palestinian man was killed in the West Bank. The attack caused some damage to an Israeli school and army bases.\\nAnother option Israel may be weighing as a response to Iran\\'s missile attack is more assassinations of leaders of Iran\\'s proxy forces and its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the U.S. official said.\\nAn all-out war between arch-foes Israel and Iran has been threatened for decades.\\nFor almost a year, Hezbollah, an Iran-backed militant group, has intensified firing of rockets into northern Israel. Tensions on that border have increased since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on Israel that killed 1,200 people. Israel responded by launching military strikes on Gaza that have killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run Gazan Health Ministry.\\nU.S. officials are concerned that a ratcheting up of tensions could lead to a broader regional conflict in the Middle East and have been trying to negotiate a cease-fire.\\nThe war tensions include groups that Iran trains, funds and supplies with weapons to promote its interests.\\nThese groups, sometimes referred to as Iran\\'s \"axis of resistance,\" include Hezbollah in Lebanon, Hamas in Gaza, Houthis rebels in Yemen and various Iraq-based militias. Among their shared interests with Iran are opposition to the state of Israel and a desire to drive western powers, chiefly U.S. troops, from the Middle East.\\nThe U.S. official said attacking Iran\\'s nuclear facilities, where the country is thought to be close to producing a weapon, is considered to be an unlikely move by Israel. Destroying or damaging deeply buried production facilities would require a major air attack.',\n",

Tim Walz faced off in New York City Tuesday night for the 2024 vice presidential debate, sparring over heated issues including abortion, border security and the economy.\\nThe debate, which went slightly above 90 minutes, was moderated by CBS anchors Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan.\\nBelow is a transcript of the exchange between the two vice-presidential nominees:\\nDEBATE TRANSCRIPT\\nNORAH O' DONNELL: Tonight, with just over a month to go until Election day, the first and only meeting between the two men who hope to become vice president of the United States, democratic Governor Tim Walz of Minnesota and Republican Senator JD Vance of Ohio now, this is likely the final debate of this election cycle. And voting is already underway in 20 states. CBS news polling shows this remains a race either presidential candidate could win. The CBS news vice presidential debate starts now.\\nJD VANCE: Fight for every single vote, and we're going to take this country back.\\nTIM WALZ: And we are ready to continue to build the future together.\\nJD VANCE: We're going to turn this whole country red with President Donald J. Trump's leadership.\\nTIM WALZ: You know, it's at the end of this little journey? Kamala Harris as the next President of the United States.\\nThis is a CBS news special. Live from CBS news headquarters in New York. America decides the Vice Presidential debate.\\nNORAH O' DONNELL: Good evening. I'm Norah O'Donnell and thank you for joining us for tonight's CBS news vice presidential debate. We want to welcome our viewers on CBS, on other networks here in the US and around the world. We have a consequential night ahead, and our focus is the issues that matter to you, the voter. Let's introduce the candidates: Minnesota's democratic governor Tim Walz and Ohio's republican senator JD Vance. Tonight, meeting for the first time.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I'm Margaret Brennan. In order to have a thoughtful and civil debate, these are the rules that both campaigns have agreed to. Questions will be directed at one candidate who will have two minutes to respond. The other candidate will be allowed two minutes for rebuttal. Then each candidate will get another minute to make further points, with an additional 1 minute each at the discretion of the moderator. The primary role of the moderators is to facilitate the debate between the candidates, enforce the rules, and provide the candidates with the opportunity to fact check claims made by each other.\\nNORAH O' DONNELL: CBS news reserves the right to mute the candidates microphones to maintain decorum. We have not shared the questions or topics with the campaigns. The stage is set. Governor, Senator, thank you for joining us. Let's get started. Tonight, our country is facing several unfolding crises. The Middle East is on the brink of war. Americans are suffering from the catastrophic impact of Hurricane Helene and now a labor strike as 25,000 dock workers from Maine to Texas are picketing. We're going to begin tonight with the Middle East, Margaret.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Norah. Earlier today, Iran launched its largest attack yet on Israel. But that attack failed thanks to joint US and Israeli defensive action. President Biden has deployed more than 40,000 US military personnel and assets to that region over the past year to try to prevent a regional war. Iran is weakened, but the US still considers it the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world, and it has drastically reduced the time it would take to develop a nuclear weapon. It is down now to one or two weeks time. Governor Walz, if you are the final voice in the situation room, would you support or oppose a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran? You have two minutes.\\nTIM WALZ: Well, thank you. And thank you for those joining at home tonight. Let's keep in mind where this started. October 7th, Hamas terrorists massacred over 1400 Israelis and took prisoners. Iran, or, Israel's ability to be able to defend itself is absolutely fundamental, getting its hostages back, fundamental, and ending the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. But the expansion of Israel and its proxies is an absolute, fundamental necessity for the United States to have the steady leadership there. You saw it experienced today, where, along with our Israeli partners and our coalition, able to stop the incoming attack. But what's fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter. It's clear. And the world saw it on that debate stage a few weeks ago. A nearly 80 year old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not what we need in this moment. But it's not just that. It's those that were closest to Donald Trump that understand how dangerous he is when the world is this dangerous. His Chief of Staff, John Kelly, said that he was the most flawed humanity being he'd ever met. And both of his Secretaries of Defense and his national security advisors said he should be nowhere near the White House. Now, the person closest to them, to Donald Trump, said he's unfit for the highest office. That was Senator Vance. What we've seen out of Vice President Harris is we've seen steady leadership. We've seen a calmness that is able to be able to draw on the coalitions, to bring them together, understanding that our allies matter. When our allies see Donald Trump turn towards Vladimir Putin, turn towards North Korea, when we start to see that type of fickleness around holding the coalitions together, we will stay committed. And as the Vice President said today, is we will protect our forces and our allied forces, and there will be consequences.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, your time is up. Senator Vance, the same question, would you support or oppose a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran? You have two minutes.\\nJD VANCE: So, Margaret, I want to answer the question. First of all, thanks, Governor. Thanks to CBS for hosting the debate. And thanks most importantly to the American people who are watching this evening and caring enough about this country to pay attention to this Vice Presidential debate. I want to answer the question, but I want to actually give an introduction to myself a little bit because I recognize a lot of Americans don't know who either one of us are. I was raised in a working class family. My mother required food assistance for periods of her life. My grandmother required Social Security help to raise me. And she raised me in part because my own mother struggled with addiction for a big chunk of my early life. I went to college on the GI bill after I enlisted in the Marine Corps and served in Iraq. And so I stand here asking to be your Vice President with extraordinary gratitude for this country, for the American dream that made it possible for me to live my dreams. And most importantly, I know that a lot of you are worried about the chaos in the world and the feeling that the American Dream is unattainable. I want to try to convince you tonight over the next 90 minutes that if we get better leadership in the White House, if we get Donald Trump back in the White House, the American Dream is going to be attainable once again. Now, to answer this particular question, we have to remember that as much as Governor Walz just accused Donald Trump of being an agent of chaos, Donald Trump actually delivered stability in the world, and he did it by establishing effective deterrence. People were afraid of stepping out of line. Iran, which launched this attack, has received over $100 billion in unfrozen assets thanks to the Kamala Harris administration. What do they use that money for? They use it to buy weapons that they're now launching against our allies and, God forbid, potentially launching against the United States as well. Donald Trump recognized that for people to fear the United States, you needed peace through strength. They needed to recognize that if they got out of line, the United States' global leadership would put stability and peace back in the world. Now, you asked about a preemptive strike, Margaret, and I want to answer the question. Look, it is up to Israel what they think they need to do to keep their country safe. And we should support our allies wherever they are when they're fighting the bad guys. I think that's the right approach to take with the Israel question.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Senator. Governor Walz, do you care to respond to any of the allegations?\\nTIM WALZ: Well, look, Donald Trump was in office. We'll sometimes hear a revisionist history, but when Donald Trump was in office, it was Donald Trump who… we had a coalition of nations that had boxed Iran's nuclear program in in the inability to advance it. Donald Trump pulled that program and put nothing else in its place. So Iran is closer to a nuclear weapon than they were before because of Donald Trump's fickle leadership. And when Iran shot down an American aircraft in international airspace, Donald Trump tweeted, because that's the standard diplomacy of Donald Trump. And when Iranian missiles did fall near US troops and they received traumatic brain injuries, Donald Trump wrote it off as headaches. Look, our allies understand that Donald Trump is fickle. He will go to whoever has the most flattery or where it makes sense to him. Steady leadership like you witnessed today, like you witnessed in April. Both Iranian attacks were repelled. Our coalition is strong, and we need the steady leadership that Kamala Harris is providing.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Vance, the US did have a diplomatic deal with Iran to temporarily pause parts of its nuclear program, and President Trump did exit that deal. He recently said just five days ago, the US must now make a diplomatic deal with Iran because the consequences are impossible. Did he make a mistake? You have 1 minute.\\nJD VANCE: Well, first of all, Margaret, diplomacy is not a dirty word, but I think that's something that Governor Walz just said is quite extraordinary. You, yourself, just said Iran is as close to a nuclear weapon today as they have ever been. And, Governor Walz, you blame Donald Trump, who has been the Vice President for the last three and a half years, and the answer is your running mate, not mine. Donald Trump consistently made the world more secure. Now, we talk about the sequence of events that led us to where we are right now, and you can't ignore October the 7th, which I appreciate Governor Walz bringing up. But when did Iran and Hamas and their proxies attack Israel? It was during the administration of Kamala Harris. So Governor Walz can criticize Donald Trump's tweets, but effective, smart diplomacy and peace through strength is how you bring stability back to a very broken world. Donald Trump has already done it once before. Ask yourself at home, when, when was the last time? I'm 40 years old. When was the last time that an American President didn't have a major conflict, breakout? The only answer is during the four years that Donald Trump was President.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Gentlemen, we have a lot to get to. Norah?\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Margaret, thank you. Let's turn now to Hurricane Helene. The storm could become one of the deadliest on record. More than 160 people are dead and hundreds more are missing. Scientists say climate change makes these hurricanes larger, stronger and more deadly because of the historic rainfall. Senator Vance, according to CBS news polling, seven in ten Americans and more than 60% of Republicans under the age of 45 favor the US taking steps to try and reduce climate change. Senator, what responsibility would the Trump administration have to try and reduce the impact of climate change? I'll give you two minutes.\\nJD VANCE: Sure. So first of all, let's start with the hurricane because it's an unbelievable, unspeakable human tragedy. I just saw today, actually, a photograph of two grandparents on a roof with a six year old child, and it was the last photograph ever taken of them because the roof collapsed and those innocent people lost their lives. And I'm sure Governor Walz joins me in saying our hearts go out to those innocent people, our prayers go out to them. And we want as robust and aggressive as a federal response as we can get to save as many lives as possible. And then, of course, afterwards, to help the people in those communities rebuild. I mean, these are communities that I love, some of them I know very personally. In Appalachia, all across the Southeast, they need their government to do their job. And I commit that when Donald Trump is president again, the government will put the citizens of this country first when they suffer from a disaster. And Norah, you asked about climate change. I think this is a very important issue. Look, a lot of people are justifiably worried about all these crazy weather patterns. I think it's important for us, first of all, to say Donald Trump and I support clean air, clean water. We want the environment to be cleaner and safer, but one of the things that I've noticed some of our democratic friends talking a lot about is a concern about carbon emissions. This idea that carbon emissions drives all the climate change. Well, let's just say that's true, just for the sake of argument, so we're not arguing about weird science. Let's just say that's true. Well, if you believe that, what would you, what would you want to do? The answer is that you'd want to reshore as much American manufacturing as possible and you'd want to produce as much energy as possible in the United States of America because we're the cleanest economy in the entire world. What have Kamala Harris's policies actually led to? More energy production in China, more manufacturing overseas, more doing business in some of the dirtiest parts of the entire world. When I say that, I mean the amount of carbon emissions they're doing per unit of economic output. So if we actually care about getting cleaner air and cleaner water, the best thing to do is to double down and invest in American workers and the American people. And unfortunately, Kamala Harris has done exactly the opposite.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Governor Walz, you have two minutes to respond.\\nTIM WALZ: Well, we got close to an agreement because all those things are happening. Look, first of all, it is a horrific tragedy with this hurricane, and my heart goes out to the folks that are down there in contact with the Governors. I serve as co-chair of the council of governors as we work together on these emergency managements. Governors know no partisanship. They work together to… all of the Governors and the emergency responders are on the ground. Those happen on the front end. The federal government comes in, makes sure they're there, that we recover. But we're still in that phase where we need to make sure that they're staying there, staying focused. Now, look, coming back to the climate change issue, there's no doubt this thing roared onto the scene faster and stronger than anything we've seen. Senator Vance has said that there's a climate problem in the past, Donald Trump called it a hoax and then joked that these things would make more beachfront property to be able to invest in. What we've seen out of the Harris administration now, the Biden Harris administration is, we've seen this investment, we've seen massive investments, the biggest in global history that we've seen in the Inflation Reduction Act, has created jobs all across the country. Two thousand in Jeffersonville, Ohio. Taking the EV technology that we invented and making it here. Two hundred thousand jobs across the country. The largest solar manufacturing plant in North America sits in Minnesota. But my farmers know climate change is real. They've seen 500 year droughts, 500 year floods, back to back. But what they're doing is adapting, and this has allowed them to tell me, 'Look, I harvest corn, I harvest soybean, and I harvest wind.' We are producing more natural gas and more oil at any time than we ever have. We're also producing more clean energy. So the solution for us is to continue to move forward, that climate change is real. Reducing our impact is absolutely critical. But this is not a false choice. You can do that at the same time you're creating the jobs that we're seeing all across the country. That's exactly what this administration has done. We are seeing us becoming an energy superpower for the future, not just the current. And that's what absolutely makes sense. And then we start thinking about, 'How do we mitigate these disasters?'\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Thank you, Senator. I want to give you an opportunity to respond there. The Governor mentioned that President Trump has called climate change a hoax. Do you agree?\\nJD VANCE: Well, look, what the President has said is that if the Democrats, in particular, Kamala Harris and her leadership, if they really believe that climate change is serious, what they would be doing is more manufacturing and more energy production in the United States of America, and that's not what they're doing. So clearly, Kamala Harris herself doesn't believe her own rhetoric on this. If she did, she would actually agree with Donald Trump's energy policies. Now, something Governor Walz said, I think is important to touch upon, because when we talk about 'clean energy,' I think that's a slogan that often the Democrats will use here. I'm talking, of course, about the Democratic leadership. And the real issue is that if you're spending hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars of American taxpayer money on solar panels that are made in China, number one, you're going to make the economy dirtier. We should be making more of those solar panels here in the United States of America.\\nTIM WALZ: We are. In Minnesota.\\nJD VANCE: Some of them are, Tim, but a lot of them are being made overseas in China, especially the components that go into those solar panels. So if you really want to make the environment cleaner, you've got to invest in more energy production. We haven't built a nuclear facility, I think one, in the past 40 years. Natural gas. We got to invest more in it. Kamala Harris has done the opposite. That's raised energy prices and also meant that we're doing worse by the climate.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Senator, your time is up. Governor, would you like to respond?\\nTIM WALZ: Well, look, we're producing more natural gas than we ever have. There's no moratorium on that. We're producing more oil. But the folks know, and my… like I said, again, these are not liberal folks. These are not folks that are green, new deal folks. These are farmers that have been, drought one year, massive flooding the next year. They understand that it makes sense. Look, our number one export cannot be topsoil from erosion from these massive storms. We saw it in Minnesota this summer. And thinking about, 'How do we respond to that?' we're thinking ahead on this and what Kamala Harris has been able to do in Minnesota, we're starting to weatherproof some of these things. The infrastructure law that was passed allows us to think about mitigation in the future. How do we make sure that we're protecting by burying our power lines? How do we make sure that we're protecting lakefronts and things that we're seeing more and more of. But to call it a hoax and to take the oil company executives to Mar-a-Lago, say, give me money for my campaign and I'll let you do whatever you want. We can be smarter about that. And an all above energy policy is exactly what she's doing, creating those jobs right here.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Governor, your time is up. The overwhelming consensus among scientists is that the earth's climate is warming at an unprecedented rate. Margaret?\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Norah. We're going to turn now to immigration. The crisis at the US-Mexico border consistently ranks as one of the top issue for American voters. Senator Vance, your campaign is pledging to carry out the largest mass deportation plan in American history and to use the US military to do so. Could you be more specific about exactly how this will work? For example, would you deport parents who have entered the US illegally and separate them from any of their children who were born on US soil? You have two minutes.\\nJD VANCE: So first of all, Margaret, before we talk about deportations, we have to stop the bleeding. We have a historic immigration crisis because Kamala Harris started and said that she wanted to undo all of Donald Trump's border policies. Ninety-four executive orders suspending deportations, decriminalizing illegal aliens, massively increasing the asylum fraud that exists in our system, that has opened the floodgates. And what it's meant is that a lot of fentanyl is coming into our country. I had a mother who struggled with opioid addiction and has gotten clean. I don't want people who are struggling with addiction to be deprived of their second chance because Kamala Harris let in fentanyl into our communities at record levels. So you've got to stop the bleeding. You've got to re-implement Donald Trump's border policies, build the wall, re-implement deportations. And that gets me to your point, Margaret, about what do we actually do? So we've got 20, 25 million illegal aliens who are here in the country. What do we do with them? I think the first thing that we do is we start with the criminal migrants. About a million of those people have committed some form of crime in addition to crossing the border illegally. I think you start with deportations on those folks, and then I think you make it harder for illegal aliens to undercut the wages of American workers. A lot of people will go home if they can't work for less than minimum wage in our own country. And by the way, that'll be really good for our workers who just want to earn a fair wage for doing a good day's work. And the final point, Margaret, is you ask about family separation. Right now in this country, Margaret, we have 320,000 children that the Department of Homeland Security has effectively lost. Some of them have been sex trafficked, some of them hopefully are at homes with their families, some of them have been used as drug trafficking mules. The real family separation policy in this country is, unfortunately, Kamala Harris's wide open southern border. And I'd ask my fellow Americans to remember when she came into office, she said she was going to do this. Real leadership would be saying, 'You know what? I screwed up. We're going to go back to Donald Trump's border policies.' I wish that she would do that, it would be good for all of us.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, do you care to respond to any of those specific allegations, including that the Vice President is, quote, 'letting in fentanyl and using kids as drug mules, among other things…'\\nTIM WALZ: Yeah, well…\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: … regarding children?\\nTIM WALZ: The drug mule is not true. But I will say about this, about the fentanyl, because this is a crisis of this, the opioid crisis. And the good news on this is the last twelve months saw the largest decrease in opioid deaths in our nation's history, 30% decrease in Ohio. But there's still more work to do. But let's go back to this on immigration. Kamala Harris was the Attorney General of the largest state and a border state in California. She's the only person in this race who prosecuted transnational gangs for human trafficking and drug interventions. But look, we all want to solve this. Most of us want to solve this. And that is the United States Congress. That's the Border Patrol Agents, that's the Chamber of Commerce. That's most Americans out here. That's why we had the fairest and the toughest bill on immigration that this nation's seen. It was crafted by a conservative senator from Oklahoma, James Lankford. I know him. He's super conservative, but he's a man of principle, wants to get it done. Democrats and Republicans worked on this piece of legislation. The Border Patrol said, this is what we need in here. These are the experts. And the Chamber of Commerce in the Wall Street Journal said, pass this thing. Kamala Harris helped get there. Fifteen hundred new border agents, detection for drugs, DOJ money to speed up these adjudications on this. Just what America wants. But as soon as it was getting ready to pass and actually tackle this Donald Trump said 'No,' told them to vote against it because it gives him a campaign issue. It gives him, what would Donald Trump talk about if we actually did some of these things? And they need to be done by the legislature. You can't just do this through the executive branch. So, look, we have the options to do this. Donald Trump had four years. He had four years to do this. And he promised you, America, how easy it would be. I'll build you a big, beautiful wall and Mexico will pay for it. Less than 2% of that wall got built and Mexico didn't pay a dime. But here we are again, nine years after he came down that escalator, dehumanizing people and telling them what he was going to do. As far as a deportation plan, at one point, Senator Vance said it was so unworkable as to be laughable. So that's where we're at. Pass the bill. She'll sign it.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, your time is up. Senator, the question was, will you separate parents from their children, even if their kids are US citizens? You have 1 minute.\\nJD VANCE: Margaret, my point is that we already have massive child separations thanks to Kamala Harris' open border. And I didn't accuse Kamala Harris of inviting drug mules, I said that she enabled the Mexican drug cartels to operate freely in this country, and we know that they use children as drug mules, and it is a disgrace and it has to stop. Look, I think what Tim said just doesn't pass the smell test. For three years, Kamala Harris went out bragging that she was going to undo Donald Trump's border policy. She did exactly that. We had a record number of illegal crossings. We had a record number of fentanyl coming into our country. And now, now that she's running for President, or a few months before, she says that somehow she got religion and cared a lot about a piece of legislation. The only thing that she did when she became the Vice President, when she became the appointed border czar, was to undo 94 Donald Trump executive actions that opened the border. This problem is leading to massive problems in the United States of America. Parents who can't afford health care, schools that are overwhelmed. It's got to stop, and it will when Donald Trump is President again.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, your time is up. Governor, what about our CBS news polling, which does show that a majority of Americans, more than 50%, support mass deportations?\\nTIM WALZ: Look, we fix this issue with a bill that is necessary. But the issue on this is this is what happens when you don't want to solve it. You demonize it. And we saw this, and Senator Vance, and it surprises me on this, talking about and saying, 'I will create stories to bring attention to this.' That vilified a large number of people who were here legally in the community of Springfield. The Republican Governor said, 'It's not true. Don't do it.' There's consequences for this. There's consequences. We could come together. Senator Lankford did it. We could come together and solve this if we didn't let Donald Trump continue to make it an issue. And the consequences in Springfield were the Governor had to send state law enforcement to escort kindergarteners to school. I believe Senator Vance wants to solve this. But by standing with Donald Trump and not working together to find a solution, it becomes a talking point. And when it becomes a talking point like this, we dehumanize and villainize other human beings.\\nJD VANCE: Tim…\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor. Governor, your time is up. Senator, I'll give you 1 minute, but let me just ask you the question first. The governor has made the point, and I think as a sitting lawmaker, you know that Congress controls the purse strings and any funding. So you have said repeatedly that Donald Trump would, through executive action, solve this. Do you disagree that Congress controls the purse strings and would need to support many of the changes that you would actually want to implement? You have 1 minute.\\nJD VANCE: Look, Margaret, first of all, the gross majority of what we need to do at the southern border is just empowering law enforcement to do their job. I've been to the southern border more than our Borders are, Kamala Harris has been. And it's actually heartbreaking because the Border Patrol Agents, they just want to be empowered to do their job. Of course, additional resources would help. But most of this is about the President and the Vice President empowering our law enforcement to say, 'If you try to come across the border illegally, you've got to stay in Mexico, you've got to go back through proper channels.' Now, Governor Walz brought up the community of Springfield, and he's very worried about the things that I've said in Springfield. Look, in Springfield, Ohio and in communities all across this country, you've got schools that are overwhelmed, you've got hospitals that are overwhelmed, you have got housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes. The people that I'm most worried about in Springfield, Ohio, are the American citizens who have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris's open border. It is a disgrace, Tim. And I actually think, I agree with you. I think you want to solve this problem, but I don't think that Kamala Harris does.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, your time is up. Governor, you have 1 minute to respond.\\nTIM WALZ: Yeah, well, it is law enforcement that asked for the bill. They helped craft it. They're the ones that supported it. It was… that's because they know we need to do this. Look, this issue of continuing to bring this up, of not dealing with it, of blaming migrants for everything. On housing, we could talk a little bit about Wall Street speculators buying up housing and making them less affordable, but it becomes a blame. Look, this bill also gives the money necessary to adjudicate. I agree. It should not take seven years for an asylum claim to be done. This bill gets it done in 90 days. Then you start to make a difference in this and you start to adhere to what we know. American principles. I don't talk about my faith a lot, but Matthew 25:40 talks about, 'To the least amongst us, you do unto me.' I think that's true of most Americans. They simply want order to it. This bill does it. It's funded, it's supported by the people who do it, and it lets us keep our dignity about how we treat other people.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Governor. And just to clarify for our viewers, Springfield, Ohio does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status. Temporary protected status. Norah.\\nJD VANCE: Well, Margaret, Margaret, I think it's important because…\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, senator. We have so much to get to.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: We're going to turn out of the economy. Thank you.\\nJD VANCE: Margaret. The rules were that you guys were going to fact check, and since you're fact checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on. So there's an application called the CBP One app where you can go on as an illegal migrant, apply for asylum or apply for parole and be granted legal status at the wave of a Kamala Harris open border wand. That is not a person coming in, applying for a green card and waiting for ten years.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Senator.\\nJD VANCE: That is the facilitation of illegal immigration, Margaret, by our own leadership. And Kamala Harris opened up that pathway.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Senator, for describing the legal process. We have so much to get to.\\nTIM WALZ: Those laws have been in the book since 1990.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, gentlemen. We want to have -\\nTIM WALZ: The CBP app has not been on the books since 1990. It's something that Kamala Harris created, Margaret.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Gentlemen, the audience can't hear you because your mics are cut. We have so much we want to get to. Thank you for explaining the legal process. Norah?\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Thank you, Margaret. The economy is a top concern for voters. Each of your campaigns has released an economic plan, so let's talk about the specifics. Governor Walz, Vice President Harris unveiled a plan that includes billions in tax credits for manufacturing, housing and a renewed child tax credit. The Wharton School says your proposals will increase the nation's deficit by $1.2 trillion. How would you pay for that without ballooning the deficit? Governor, I'll give you two minutes.\\nTIM WALZ: Yeah. Thank you. And Kamala Harris and I do believe in the middle class because that's where we come from. We both grew up in that. We understand. So those of you out there listening tonight, you're hearing a lot of stuff back and forth. And it's good. It's healthy. That's what this is supposed to happen. You should be listening. 'How's this going to impact me?' The bold forward plan that Kamala Harris put out there is, one, is talking about this housing issue. The one thing is there's 3 million new houses proposed under this plan with down payment assistance on the front end. To get you in a house. A house is much more than just an asset to be traded somewhere. It's foundational to where you're at. And then making sure that the things you buy every day, whether they be prescription drugs or other things, that there's fairness in that. Look, the $35 insulin is a good thing, but it costs $5 to make insulin. They were charging $800 before this law went into effect. As far as the housing goes, I've seen it in Minnesota, 12% more houses in Minneapolis, prices went down on rent, 4%. It's working. And then making sure tax cuts go to the middle class, $6,000 child tax credit. We have one in Minnesota, reduces childhood poverty by a third. We save money in the long run and we do the right thing for families and then getting businesses off the ground. The law, as it stands right now, is $5,000 tax credit for small business, increasing that to $50,000. Now, this is a philosophical difference between us. Donald Trump made a promise, and I'll give you this. He kept it. He took folks to Mar-a-Lago. He said, 'You're rich as hell. I'm going to give you a tax cut.' He gave the tax cuts that predominantly went to the top caste. What happened there was an $8 trillion increase in the national debt, the largest ever. Now he's proposing a 20% consumption or sales tax on everything we bring in. Everyone agrees, including businesses. It would be destabilizing it. It would increase inflation and potentially lead to a recession. Look, this is simple for you. Where are we going? Kamala Harris has said to do the things she wants to do. We'll just ask the wealthiest to pay their fair share. When you do that, our system works best. More people are participating in it, and folks have the things that they need.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Senator, I want to give you a moment to respond on that. But similarly, the Wharton School has done an analysis of the Trump plan and says it would increase the nation's deficit by 5.8 trillion. My question is the same for you. How do you pay for all that without ballooning the deficit? I'll give you two minutes.\\nJD VANCE: Well, first of all, you're going to hear a lot from Tim Walz this evening, and you just heard it in the answer, a lot of what Kamala Harris proposes to do. And some of it, I'll be honest with you, it even sounds pretty good. Here's what you won't hear, is that Kamala Harris has already done it. Because she's been the Vice President for three and a half years, she had the opportunity to enact all of these great policies. And what she's actually done instead is drive the cost of food higher by 25%, drive the cost of housing higher by about 60%, open the American southern border and make middle class life unaffordable for a large number of Americans. If Kamala Harris has such great plans for how to address middle class problems, then she ought to do them now, not when asking for a promotion, but in the job the American people gave her three and a half years ago. And the fact that she isn't, tells you a lot about how much you can trust her actual plans. Now, Donald Trump's economic plan is not just a plan, but it's also a record. A lot of those same economists attack Donald Trump's plans, and they have PhDs, but they don't have common sense and they don't have wisdom, because Donald Trump's economic policies delivered the highest take home pay in a generation in this country, 1.5% inflation, and to boot, peace and security all over the world. So when people say that Donald Trump's economic plan doesn't make sense, I say 'Look at the record he delivered: rising take home pay for American workers.' Now, Tim admirably admits that they want to undo the Trump tax cuts. But if you look at what was so different about Donald Trump's tax cuts, even from previous Republican tax cut plans, is that a lot of those resources went to giving more take home pay to middle class and working class Americans. It was passed in 2017, and you saw an American economic boom unlike we've seen in a generation in this country. That is a record that I'm proud to run on and we're going to get back to that common sense wisdom so that you can afford to live the American Dream again. I know a lot of you are struggling. I know a lot of you are worried about paying the bills. It's going to stop when Donald Trump brings back common sense to this country.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Governor, do you want to respond to that? What has Kamala Harris done for the middle class?\\nTIM WALZ: Yeah. Yeah, well, Kamala Harris' day one was Donald Trump's failure on COVID that led to the collapse of our economy. We were already before COVID, in a manufacturing recession. But 10 million people out of work, largest percentage since the Great Depression, 9 million jobs closed on that. That was day one. Whether it was the Infrastructure Act or other things, we moved. Now, you made a question about experts, said this, I made a note of this. 'Economists don't, can't be trusted. Science can't be trusted. National security folks can't be trusted.' Look, if you're going to be President, you don't have all the answers. Donald Trump believes he does. My pro tip of the day is this, if you need heart surgery, listen to the people at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, not Donald Trump. And the same thing goes with this and I ask you out there, teachers, nurses, truck drivers, whatever, how is it fair that you're paying your taxes every year and Donald Trump hasn't paid any Federal Tax 10 to last 15 years, in the last year as President? That's what's wrong with the system. There's a way around it. And he's bragged about that. We're just asking for fairness in it, and that's all you want.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: You have a minute.\\nJD VANCE: Governor, you say trust the experts, but those same experts for 40 years said that if we shipped our manufacturing base off to China, we'd get cheaper goods. They lied about that. They said if we shipped our industrial base off to other countries, to Mexico and elsewhere, it would make the middle class stronger. They were wrong about that. They were wrong about the idea that if we made America less self-reliant, less productive in our own Nation, that it would somehow make us better off. And they were wrong about it. And for the first time in a generation, Donald Trump had the wisdom and the courage to say to that bipartisan consensus, we're not doing it anymore. We're bringing American manufacturing back. We're unleashing American energy. We're going to make more of our own stuff. And this isn't just an economic issue. I mean, I've got three beautiful little kids at home: seven, four and two. And I love them very much. And I hope they're in bed right now. But look, so many of the drugs, the pharmaceuticals that we put in the bodies of our children are manufactured by nations that hate us. This has to stop. And we're not going to stop it by listening to experts. We're going to stop it by listening to common sense wisdom, which is what Donald Trump governed on.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Senator, your time is up. Governor Walz, can you address that? I mean, voters say they trust Donald Trump on the economy more. Why?\\nTIM WALZ: If you're listening tonight, and you want billionaires to get tax cuts, you heard what the numbers were. Look, I'm a union guy on this. I'm not a guy who wanted to ship things overseas, but I understand that, look, we produce soybeans and corn. We need to have fair trading partners. That's something that we believe in. I think the thing that most concerns me on this is, is Donald Trump was the guy who created the largest trade deficit in American history with China. So the rhetoric is good. Much of what the senator said right there, I'm in agreement with him on this. I watched it happen, too. I watched it in my communities and we talked about that. But we had people undercutting the right to collectively bargain. We had right to work states made it more difficult. We had companies that were willing to ship it over, and we saw people profit. Folks that, folks that are venture capital, in some cases, putting money into companies that were overseas, we're in agreement that we bring those home. The issue is Donald Trump is talking about it. Kamala Harris has a record. Two hundred fifty thousand more manufacturing jobs just out of the IRA.\\nJD VANCE: May I respond to that?\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Yes.\\nJD VANCE: So, appreciate that. So if you notice, what Governor Walz just did is he said, 'First of all, Donald Trump has to listen to the experts.' And then when he acknowledged that the experts screwed up, he said, well, 'Donald Trump didn't do nearly as good of a job as the statistics show that he did.'\\nTIM WALZ: No, that's a gross generalization.\\nJD VANCE: So what Tim Walz is doing. And I honestly, Tim, I think you got a tough job here because you've got to play whack-a-mole. You've got to pretend that Donald Trump didn't deliver rising take home pay. Which, of course, he did. You've got to pretend that Donald Trump didn't deliver lower inflation, which, of course, he did. And then you've simultaneously got to defend Kamala Harris's atrocious economic record, which has made gas, groceries, and housing unaffordable for American citizens. I was raised by a woman who would sometimes go into medical debt so that she could put food on the table in our household. I know what it's like to not be able to afford the things that you need to afford. We can do so much better. To all of you watching, we can get back to an America that's affordable again. We just got to get back to common sense, economic principles.\\nTIM WALZ: I hope we have a conversation on health care then.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Senator. Governor.\\nJD VANCE: Please.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Thank you, Margaret.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We have a lot to get to ahead, gentlemen, on many topics. But right now I want to talk about personal qualifications. The Vice President is often the last voice the President hears before making consequential decisions. We want to ask you about your leadership qualities, Governor Walz. You said you were in Hong Kong during the deadly Tiananmen Square protest in the spring of 1989. But Minnesota Public Radio and other media outlets are reporting that you actually didn't travel to Asia until August of that year. Can you explain that discrepancy? You have two minutes.\\nTIM WALZ: Yeah. Well, and to the folks out there who didn't get at the top of this, look, I grew up in small, rural Nebraska, town of 400. Town that you rode your bike with your buddies till the streetlights come on, and I'm proud of that service. I joined the National Guard at 17, worked on family farms, and then I used the GI bill to become a teacher. Passionate about it, a young teacher. My first year out, I got the opportunity in the summer of 89 to travel to China, 35 years ago, be able to do that. I came back home and then started a program to take young people there. We would take basketball teams, we would take baseball teams, we would take dancers, and we would go back and forth to China. The issue for that was, was to try and learn. Now, look, my community knows who I am. They saw where I was at. They, look, I will be the first to tell you I have poured my heart into my community. I've tried to do the best I can, but I've not been perfect. And I'm a knucklehead at times, but it's always been about that. Those same people elected me to Congress for twelve years. And in Congress I was one of the most bipartisan people. Working on things like farm bills that we got done, working on veterans benefits. And then the people of Minnesota were able to elect me to governor twice. So look, my commitment has been from the beginning, to make sure that I'm there for the people, to make sure that I get this right. I will say more than anything, many times, I will talk a lot. I will get caught up in the rhetoric. But being there, the impact it made, the difference it made in my life. I learned a lot about China. I hear the critiques of this. I would make the case that Donald Trump should have come on one of those trips with us. I guarantee you he wouldn't be praising Xi Jinping about COVID. And I guarantee you he wouldn't start a trade war that he ends up losing. So this is about trying to understand the world. It's about trying to do the best you can for your community, and then it's putting yourself out there and letting your folks understand what it is. My commitment, whether it be through teaching, which I was good at, or whether it was being a good soldier or was being a good member of Congress, those are the things that I think are the values that people care about.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, just to follow up on that, the question was, can you explain the discrepancy?\\nTIM WALZ: No. All I said on this was, is, I got there that summer and misspoke on this, so I will just, that's what I've said. So I was in Hong Kong and China during the democracy protest, went in, and from that, I learned a lot of what needed to be in governance.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, governor. Senator Vance, in 2016, you called your running mate, Donald Trump, unfit for the nation's highest office, and you said he could be America's Hitler. I know you've said, you've been asked many times, and you've said you regret those comments and explained, you then voted for Donald Trump in 2020. But the Washington Post reported new messages last week in which you also disparaged Trump's economic record while he was President. Writing to someone in 2020, quote, 'Trump thoroughly failed to deliver his economic populism.' You're now his running mate, and you've shifted many of your policy stances to align with his. If you become Vice President, why should Americans trust that you will give Donald Trump the advice he needs to hear, and not just the advice he wants to hear? You have two minutes.\\nJD VANCE: Well, first of all, Margaret, because I've always been open and sometimes, of course, I've disagreed with the President, but I've also been extremely open about the fact that I was wrong about Donald Trump. I was wrong, first of all, because I believed some of the media stories that turned out to be dishonest fabrications of his record. But most importantly, Donald Trump delivered for the American people rising wages, rising take home pay, an economy that worked for normal Americans. A secure southern border. A lot of things, frankly, that I didn't think he'd be able to deliver on. And yeah, when you screw up, when you misspeak, when you get something wrong and you change your mind, you ought to be honest with the American people about it. It's one of the reasons, Margaret, why I've done so many interviews is because I think it's important to actually explain to the American people where I come down on the issues and what changed. Now you pointed out to messages from 2020. Margaret, I've been extremely consistent that I think there were a lot of things that we could have done better in the Trump administration the first round, if Congress was doing its job. I strongly believe, and I've been a United States Senator, that Congress is not just a high-class debating society. It's not just a forum for senators and congressmen to whine about problems. It's a forum to govern. So there were a lot of things on the border, on tariffs, for example, where I think that we could have done so much more if the Republican Congress and the Democrats in Congress had been a little bit better about how they governed the country. They were so obsessed with impeaching Donald Trump, they couldn't actually govern. And I want to talk about this tariff issue in particular, Margaret, because, you know, Tim just accused this of being a national sales tax. Look, the one thing, and you're not probably surprised to hear me praising Joe Biden, but the one thing that Joe Biden did is he continued some of the Trump tariffs that protected American manufacturing jobs. And it's the one issue, the most pro worker part of the Biden administration. It's the one issue where Kamala Harris has run away from Joe Biden's record. Think about this. If you're trying to employ slave laborers in China at $3 a day, you're going to do that and undercut the wages of American workers unless our country stands up for itself and says you're not accessing our markets unless you're paying middle class Americans a fair wage.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, your time is up. Norah.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Thank you. Now to the issue of reproductive rights. Governor Walz, after Roe v. Wade was overturned, you signed a bill into law that made Minnesota one of the least restrictive states in the nation when it comes to abortion. Former President Trump said in the last debate that. You believe abortion, quote, in the 9th month is absolutely fine. Yes or no? Is that what you support? I'll give you two minutes.\\nTIM WALZ: That's not what the bill says. But look, this issue is what's on everyone's mind. Donald Trump put this all into motion. He brags about how great it was that he put the judges in and overturned Roe versus Wade, 52 years of personal autonomy. And then he tells us, oh, we send it to the states. It's a beautiful thing. Amanda Zaworski would disagree with you on it's a beautiful thing. A young bride in Texas waiting for their child at 18 weeks. She has a complication, a tear in the membrane. She needs to go in. The medical care at that point needs to be decided by the doctor. And that would have been an abortion. But in Texas, that would have put them in legal jeopardy. She went home, got sepsis, nearly dies, and now she may have difficulty having children. Or in Kentucky, Hadley Duvall, a twelve year old child raped and impregnated by her stepfather. Those are horrific. Now, when got asked about that, Senator Vance said, two wrongs don't make a right. There is no right in this. So in Minnesota, what we did was restore Roe v. Wade. We made sure that we put women in charge of their health care. But look, this is not what, if you don't know Amanda or a Hadley, you soon will. Their Project 2025 is going to have a registry of pregnancies. It's going to make it more difficult, if not impossible to get contraception and limit access, if not eliminate access to infertility treatments. For so many of you out there listening, me included, infertility treatments are why I have a child. That's nobody else's business. But those things are being proposed, and the catchall on this is, is, well, the states will decide what's right for Texas might not be right for Washington. That's not how this works. This is basic human right. We have seen maternal mortality skyrocket in Texas, outpacing many other countries in the world. This is about health care. In Minnesota, we are ranked first in health care for a reason. We trust women. We trust doctors.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Senator, do you want to respond to the governor's claim? Will you create a federal pregnancy monitoring agency?\\nJD VANCE: No, Norah, certainly we won't. And I want to talk about this issue because I know a lot of Americans care about it, and I know a lot of Americans don't agree with everything that I've ever said on this topic. And, you know, I grew up in a working class family in a neighborhood where I knew a lot of young women who had unplanned pregnancies and decided to terminate those pregnancies because they feel like they didn't have any other options. And, you know, one of them is actually very dear to me. And I know she's watching tonight, and I love you. And she told me something a couple years ago that she felt like if she hadn't had that abortion, that it would have destroyed her life because she was in an abusive relationship. And I think that what I take from that, as a Republican who proudly wants to protect innocent life in this country, who proudly wants to protect the vulnerable is that my party, we've got to do so much better of a job at earning the American People's trust back on this issue where they frankly just don't trust us. And I think that's one of the things that Donald Trump and I are endeavoring to do. I want us, as a Republican Party, to be pro-family in the fullest sense of the word. I want us to support fertility treatments. I want us to make it easier for moms to afford to have babies. I want it to make it easier for young families to afford a home so they can afford a place to raise that family. And I think there's so much that we can do on the public policy front just to give women more options. Now, of course, Donald Trump has been very clear that on the abortion policy specifically, that we have a big country and it's diverse. And California has a different viewpoint on this than Georgia. Georgia has a different viewpoint from Arizona. And the proper way to handle this, as messy as democracy sometimes is, is to let voters make these decisions, let the individual states make their abortion policy. And I think that's what makes the most sense in a very big, a very diverse, and let's be honest, sometimes a very, very messy and divided country.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Governor, would you like to respond and also answer the question about restrictions?\\nTIM WALZ: Yeah. Well, the question got asked, and Donald Trump made the accusation that wasn't true about Minnesota. Well, let me tell you about this idea that there's diverse states. There's a young woman named Amber Thurmond. She happened to be in Georgia, a restrictive state. Because of that, she had to travel a long distance to North Carolina to try and get her care. Amber Thurman died in that journey back and forth. The fact of the matter is, how can we as a nation say that your life and your rights as basic as the right to control your own body is determined on geography? There's a very real chance, had Amber Thurman lived in Minnesota, she would be alive today. That's why the restoration of Roe v. Wade. When you listen to Vice President Harris talk about this subject, and you hear me talk about it, you hear us talking exactly the same. Donald Trump is trying to figure out how to get the political right of this. I agree with a lot of what Senator Vance said about what's happening. His running mate, though, does not. And that's the problem.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Governor, your time is up. Senator, let me ask you about that. He mentioned it was, I think, referring to a national ban. In the past, you have supported a Federal ban on abortion after 15 weeks. In fact, you said if someone can't support legislation like that, quote, you are making the United States the most barbaric pro-abortion regime anywhere in the entire world. My question is, why have you changed your position?\\nJD VANCE: Well, Norah, first of all, I never supported a national ban. I did during, when I was running for Senate in 2022, talk about setting some minimum national standard. For example, we have a partial birth abortion ban in this, in place in this country at the federal level. I don't think anybody's trying to get rid of that, or at least I hope not, though I know that Democrats have taken a very radical pro-abortion stance. But, Norah, you know, one of the things that changed is in the state of Ohio, we had a referendum in 2023, and the people of Ohio voted overwhelmingly, by the way, against my position. And I think that what I learned from that, Norah, is that we've got to do a better job at winning back people's trust. So many young women would love to have families. So many young women also see an unplanned pregnancy as something that's going to destroy their livelihood, destroy their education, destroy their relationships. And we have got to earn people's trust back. And that's why Donald Trump and I are committed to pursuing pro-family policies. Making childcare more accessible, making fertility treatments more accessible, because we've got to do a better job at that. And that's what real leadership is.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Governor, your response?\\nTIM WALZ: I'm going to respond on the pro abortion piece of that. No, we're not. We're pro women. We're pro freedom to make your own choice. We know what the implications are to not be that women having miscarriages, women not getting the care, physicians feeling like they may be prosecuted for providing that care. And as far as making sure that we're educating our children and giving them options. Minnesota's a state with one of the lowest teen pregnancy rates. We understand that, too. We know that the options need to be available, and we make that true. We also make it, we're a top three state for the best place to raise children. But these two things to try and say that we're pro-children but we don't like this or, or you guys are pro abortion, that's not the case at all. We are pro freedoms for women to make their choices. And we're going, and Kamala Harris is making the case to make options for children more affordable. A $6,000 child tax credit. But we're not going to base out on the backs of making someone like Amber Thurmond drive 600 miles to try and get health care.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Senator.\\nJD VANCE: May I respond to that? First of all, Governor, I agree with you. Amber Thurmond should still be alive. And there are a lot of people who should still be alive, and I certainly wish that she was. And maybe, you're free to disagree with me on this and explain this to me, but as I read the Minnesota law that you signed into law, the statute that you signed into law, it says that a doctor who presides over an abortion, where the baby survives, the doctor is under no obligation to provide lifesaving care to a baby who survives a botched late term abortion. That is, I think, whether it's not pro choice or pro abortion, that is fundamentally barbaric. And that's why I use that word, Norah, is because some of what we've seen, do you want to force catholic hospitals to perform abortions against their will? Because Kamala Harris has supported suing catholic nuns to violate their freedom of conscience? We can be a big and diverse country where we respect people's freedom of conscience. And make the country more pro baby and pro family. But please.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Yes, Governor, please respond.\\nTIM WALZ: Look, this is one where there's always something there. This is a very simple proposition. These are women's decisions to make about their healthcare decisions and the physicians who know best when they need to do this, trying to distort the way a law is written, to try and make a point. That's not it at all.\\nJD VANCE: What was I wrong about? Governor, please tell me. What was I wrong about?\\nTIM WALZ: That is not the way the law is written. Look, I've given.\\nJD VANCE: But how.\\nTIM WALZ: I've given this advice on a lot of things that getting involved, getting, that's been misread. And it was fact checked at the last debate. But the point on this is, is there's a continuation of these guys to try and tell women or to get involved. I use this line on this. Just mind your own business on this. Things worked best when Roe v. Wade was in place. When we do a restoration of Roe, that works best. That doesn't preclude us from increasing funding for children. It doesn't increase us from making sure that once that child's born, like in Minnesota, they get meals, they get early childhood education, they get healthcare. So the hiding behind we're going to do all these other things when you're not proposing them in your budget? Kamala Harris is proposing them. She's proposing all those things to make life easier for families.\\nJD VANCE: I asked a specific question, Governor. And you gave me a slogan as a response.\\nTIM WALZ: It's not the case. It's not true. That's not what the law says. So they fact checked it with President Trump.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Gentlemen, there's a lot to discuss. We have to move on. And we're going to be right back with much more of the CBS news Vice Presidential debate in just a moment.\\nSecond Segment\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Welcome back to the CBS news Vice Presidential debate. We want to turn now to America's gun violence epidemic, the leading cause of death for children and teens in America is by firearms. Senator Vance, you oppose most gun legislation that Democrats claim would curb gun violence. You oppose red flag gun laws and legislation to ban certain semi automatic rifles, including AR-15s. So let me ask you. Earlier this year, for the first time, the parents of a school shooter were convicted of involuntary manslaughter and sentenced to ten years in prison. Do you think holding parents responsible could curb mass shootings? I'll give you two minutes.\\nJD VANCE: Yeah. Well, Norah, on that particular case, I don't know the full details, but I certainly trust local law enforcement and local authorities to make those decisions. I think in some cases the answer is going to be yes, and in some cases the answer is going to be no. And the details really matter here. Of course. For example, if a kid steals a gun, that's going to be different than if a parent hands over a gun knowing that their kid is potentially dangerous. Look, I want to just sort of speak as a father of three beautiful little kids, and our oldest is now in second grade. And like a lot of parents, we send our kids to school with such hope and such joy and such pride at their little faces on the first day of school. And we know, unfortunately, that a lot of kids are going to experience this terrible epidemic of gun violence. And of course, our hearts go out to the families that are affected by this terrible stuff. And we do have to do better. And I think that Governor Walz and I actually probably agree that we need to do better on this. The question is just how do we actually do it? Now, here's something that really bothers me and worries me about this epidemic of violence. The gross majority, close to 90%, and some of the statistics I've seen of the gun violence in this country is committed with illegally obtained firearms. And while we're on that topic, we know that thanks to Kamala Harris's open border, we've seen a massive influx in the number of illegal guns run by the Mexican drug cartel. So that number, the amount of illegal guns in our country is higher today than it was three and a half years ago. But what do we do about the schools? What do we do to protect our kids? And I think the answer is, and I say this not loving the answer because I don't want my kids to go to school and a school that feels unsafe or where there are visible signs of security. But I unfortunately think that we have to increase security in our schools. We have to make the doors lock better. We have to make the doors stronger. We've got to make the windows stronger. And of course, we've got to increase school resource officers because the idea that we can magically wave a wand and take guns out of the hands of bad guys, it just doesn't fit with recent experience. So we've got to make our schools safer, and I think we've got to have some common sense, bipartisan solutions for how to do that.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Governor, you have two minutes.\\nTIM WALZ: Well, I think all the parents watching tonight, this is your biggest nightmare. Look, I got a, I got a 17 year old, and he witnessed a shooting at a community center playing volleyball. Those things don't leave you.\\nJD VANCE: Awful.\\nTIM WALZ: As a member of Congress. I sat in my office surrounded by dozens of the Sandy Oak parents, and they were looking at my seven year old picture on the wall. Their seven year old were dead. And they were asking us to do something. And look, I'm a hunter. I own firearms. The Vice President is. We understand that the Second Amendment is there, but our first responsibility is to our kids to figure this out. In Minnesota, we've enacted enhanced red flag laws, enhanced background checks, and we can start to get data. But here's the problem. If we really want to solve this, we've got folks that won't allow research to be even done on gun violence. And this idea that we should just live with it. And I, here's what I do think and this is a good start to the conversation. I 100% believe that Senator Vance hates it when these kids, it's abhorrent, and it breaks your heart. I agree with that. But that's not far enough when we know there are things that worked. I've spent time in Finland and seen some Finnish schools. They don't have this happen even though they have a high gun ownership rate in the country. There are reasonable things that we can do to make a difference. It's not infringing on your Second Amendment. And the idea to have some of these weapons out there. It just doesn't make any sense. Kamala Harris, as an Attorney General, worked on this issue. She knows that it's there. No one's trying to scaremonger and say, we're taking your guns. But I ask all of you out there, do you want your school's hardened to look like a fort? Is that what we have to go… when we know there's countries around the world that their children aren't practicing these types of drills? They're being kids. We owe it to them to get a fix. These are things that shouldn't be that difficult. You can still keep your firearms, and we can make a difference. We have to. If you're listening tonight, this breaks your heart.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Senator?\\nJD VANCE: Tim, first of all, I didn't know that your 17 year old witnessed the shooting. And I'm sorry about that. And I hope,\\nTIM WALZ: I appreciate that.\\nJD VANCE: Christ, have mercy. It is awful. And I appreciate what Tim said, actually, about Finland. 'Cause I do think it illustrates some of the, frankly weird differences between our own country's gun violence problem and Finland is. Okay, first of all, we have way higher rates of mental health abuse or mental health substance abuse. We have way higher rates of depression, way higher rates of anxiety. We, unfortunately, have a mental health crisis in this country that I really do think that we need to get to the root causes of because I don't think it's the whole reason why we have such a bad gun violence problem. But I do think it's a big piece of it. Another driver of the gun violence epidemic, especially that affecting our kids. It doesn't earn as many headlines, but is the terrible gun violence problem in a lot of our big cities. And this is why we have to empower law enforcement to arrest the bad guys, put them away, and take gun offenders off the streets. I think there's a whole host of things that we can do here, but I do think at our schools, we've got to talk about more security.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Senator, thank you. Governor, you previously opposed an assault weapons ban, but only later in your political career did you change your position. Why?\\nTIM WALZ: Yeah. I sat in that office with those Sandy Hook parents. I've become friends with school shooters. I've seen it. Look, the NRA. I was the NRA guy for a long time. They used to teach gun safety. I'm of an age where my shotgun was in my car so I could pheasant hunt after football practice. That's not where we live today. And several things I want to mention on this is talking about cities and where it's at. The number one, where the most firearm deaths happen in Minnesota are rural suicides. And we have an epidemic of children getting guns and shooting themselves. And so we have, and we should look at all of the issues, making sure folks have healthcare and all that. But I want to be very careful. This idea of stigmatizing mental health, just because you have a mental health issue doesn't mean you're violent. And I think what we end up doing is we start looking for a scapegoat. Sometimes it just is the guns. It's just the guns. And there are things that you can do about it. But I do think that this is one, and I think this is a healthy conversation. I think there's a capacity to find solutions on this that work, protect Second Amendment, protect our children. That's our priority.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Gentlemen, thank you. Margaret.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Norah. Let's turn now to the top contributor to inflation, the high cost of housing and rent. There's a shortage of more than 4 million homes in the United States and this contributes to the high housing crisis. Governor Walz, the Harris campaign promises a $25,000 down payment assistance for first time homebuyers and a $10,000 tax credit. They also promise to build 3 million new homes. Where are you building these new homes and won't handing out that kind of money just drive up prices higher?\\nTIM WALZ: No, it's not handing out. First, let me say this, this issue of housing. And I think those of you listening on this. The problem we've had is that we've got a lot of folks that see housing as another commodity. It can be bought up. It can be shifted. It can be moved around. Those are not folks living in those houses. Those of you listening tonight, that house is a big deal. I bought and owned one house in my life. My mom still lives in the house where I was. And when I think of a house, I'm thinking of Christmas services after midnight Mass, where you go with your family. We need to make it more affordable. And one of the things, as I said, this program that the Vice President is pushing forward and bringing a new way of approaching. This is something we're doing in Minnesota from that lead. We in the state invested in making sure our housing was the biggest investment that we'd ever made in housing. It starts to make it easier. We cut some of the red tape. Local folks, look, we can't do at the Federal level, but local folks make it easier to build those homes. And then that down payment assistance. I can tell all of you out there, one of the, certainly for me, using the GI bill was one thing, but a veteran's home loan, the big thing about a veteran's home loan is you don't have to pay the down payment. Those are things that make it there. Now, look, you're going to pay it back and you're going to pay your mortgage. Those are things that we know in the long run, the appreciated value, the generational wealth that's created from it. And I will give Minneapolis an example. Minneapolis is the one city where we've seen the lowest inflation rates. We've seen a 12% increase in stock because we put some of these things in. And we're implementing a state program to make sure we give some of that down payment assistance. We get it back from people, because here's what we know. People with stable housing end up with stable jobs. People with stable housing have their kids able to get to school. All of those things in the long run, end up saving our money. And that's the thing that I think we should be able to find some common ground in. But we can't blame immigrants for the only reason that's not the case that's happening in many cities. The fact of the matter is, is that we don't have enough naturally affordable housing, but we can make sure that the government's there to help kickstart it, create that, create that base.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, your time is up. Senator Vance, as far as your campaign's position, the promise is to seize federal lands to build homes, remove regulation, provide tax breaks, and cut back on immigration, which you say pushes up prices. Where are you going to build all the new homes you're promising? And what part of any of this plan will provide immediate relief? You have two minutes.\\nJD VANCE: Well, first of all, Tim just said something that I agree with. We don't want to blame immigrants for higher housing prices. But we do want to blame Kamala Harris for letting in millions of illegal aliens into this country…\\nTIM WALZ: Pass the bill.\\nJD VANCE: …which does drive up costs, Tim. Twenty-five million illegal aliens competing with Americans for scarce homes is one of the most significant drivers of home prices in the country. It's why we have massive increases in home prices that have happened right alongside massive increases in illegal alien, alien populations under Kamala Harris's leadership. Now, Tim just mentioned a bunch of ideas. Now, some of those ideas I actually think are halfway decent, and some of them I disagree with. But the most important thing here is Kamala Harris is not running as a newcomer to politics. She is the sitting Vice President. If she wants to enact all of these policies to make housing more affordable, I invite her to use the office that the American people already gave her, not sit around and campaign and do nothing while Americans find the American Dream of home ownership completely unaffordable. Now, you asked Margaret what would immediately change the equation for American citizens? If you lower energy prices. As Donald Trump says, 'Drill, baby, drill.' One of the biggest drivers of housing costs, aside from illegal immigration, is think about it: if a truck driver is paying 40% more for diesel, then the lumber he's delivering to the job site to build the house is also going to become a lot more expensive. If we open up American energy, you will get immediate pricing release, relief, for American citizens, not, by the way, just in housing, but in a whole host of other economic goods too.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Vance, you still have 23 seconds there. Do you want to answer?\\nTIM WALZ: Can I have it?\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Where, Governor, we will get to you in a moment. But, Senator, where are you going to seize the federal lands. Can you clarify?\\nJD VANCE: Well, what Donald Trump has said is we have a lot of federal lands that aren't being used for anything. They're not being used for national parks. They're not being used. And they could be places where we build a lot of housing. And I do think that we should be opening up building in this country. We have a lot of land that could be used. We have a lot of Americans that need homes. We should be kicking out illegal immigrants who are competing for those homes, and we should be building more homes for the American citizens who deserve to be here.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, your time is up. Governor, I do want to let you respond to the allegation that the Vice President is letting in migrants\\nTIM WALZ: Well, of course, that's not true. And again, you have the facts. I guess we agreed not to fact check. I'll check it. That, look, crossings are down compared to when Donald Trump left office. But it's, again, blaming and not trying to find the solution. I was going to ask, though, on this question, are we going to drill and build houses in the same federal land. And I think when people hear federal lands, these are really important pieces of land. Now, Minnesota doesn't have a lot of federal lands. I know in the western part of the countries we do. There's not a lot of federal lands in and around Minneapolis, for example. So the issue is, I don't understand the federal lands issue unless we see this. And I worry about this as someone who cares deeply about our national parks and our federal lands. Look, Minnesota, we protect these things. We've got about 20% of the world's fresh water. These lands protect. They're there for a reason. They belong to all of us. But again, this is when you view housing and you view these things as commodities, like there's a chance to make money here. Let's take this federal land and let's sell it to people for that. I think there's better ways to do this. We've seen it in Minnesota. We're able to refurbish some of these houses. We're able to make some investments, that gets people in. And I'm still on the fact, on this, economist, Senator Vance, you said you don't like the economist, which economists are saying that it is immigrants that's adding to the cost.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, governor, your time is, your time is up.\\nTIM WALZ: Sorry.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: But, Senator, on that point, I'd like for you to clarify. There are many contributing factors to high housing costs. What evidence do you have that migrants are part of this problem?\\nJD VANCE: Well, there's a Federal Reserve study that we're happy to share after the debate. We'll put it up on social media. Actually, that really drills down on the connection between increased levels of migration, especially illegal immigration, and higher housing prices. Now, of course, Margaret, that's not the entire driver of higher housing prices. It's also the regulatory regime of Kamala Harris. Look, we are a country of builders. We're a country of doers. We're a country of explorers. But we increasingly have a Federal administration that makes it harder to develop our resources, makes it harder to build things, and wants to throw people in jail for not doing everything exactly as Kamala Harris says that they have to do. And what that means is that you have a lot of people who would love to build homes who aren't able to build homes. I actually agree with Tim Walz. We should get out of this idea of housing as a commodity. But the thing that has most turned housing into a commodity is giving it away to millions upon millions of people who have no legal right to be here.\\nTIM WALZ: What are the federal regulations? I deal with this as a Governor.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You can very quickly reply.\\nTIM WALZ: I'm sorry. I get this as a Governor, and I don't necessarily disagree with that, that in some cases, many of those are local, many of them are state. I don't know which ones are federal, but I think whenever we talk regulations, people think they can get rid of them. I think you want to be able to get out of your house in a fire. I think you want to make sure that it's fireproof and those types of things. So which are the regulations? Because the vice president's not responsible for those. Congress writes those.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, thank you, gentlemen. We have a lot to get through. You're passionate about the housing crisis. I can tell. But Norah?\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Thank you. One of the top problems facing Americans is the high cost of health care. Senator Vance, at the last Presidential debate, former President Trump was asked about replacing the Affordable Care act. In response, he said, I have concepts of a plan. Since then, Senator, you've talked about changing how chronically ill Americans get health insurance. Can you explain how that would work? And can you guarantee that Americans with pre-existing conditions won't pay more? I'll give you two minutes.\\nJD VANCE: Well, of course, we're going to cover Americans with pre-existing conditions. In fact, a lot of my family members have gotten health care, I believe, you know, members of my family actually got private health insurance, at least, for the first time, switched off of Medicaid onto private insurance for the first time, under Donald Trump's leadership. And I think that, you know, a lot of people have criticized this 'concepts of a plan' remark. I think it's very simple common sense. I think, as Tim Walz knows from twelve years in Congress, you're not going to propose a 900 page bill standing on a debate stage. It would bore everybody to tears and it wouldn't actually mean anything because part of this is the give and take of bipartisan negotiation. Now, when Donald Trump was actually President, and again, he has a record to be proud of, prescription drugs fell in 2018 for the first time in a very long time. Under Kamala Harris's leadership, prescription drugs are up about 7%. Under Donald Trump's entire four years, they were up about one and a half percent. He introduced pricing transparency. Think about healthcare. You go into a hospital, you try to buy something, and nobody knows what it actually costs. That price transparency will actually give American consumers a little bit more choice and will also drive down costs. And we talked about, you know, the reinsurance regulations is what I was talking about. Look, Donald Trump has said that if we allow states to experiment a little bit on how to cover both the chronically ill, but the non chronically ill. It's not just a plan. He actually implemented some of these regulations when he was President of the United States. And I think you can make a really good argument that it salvaged Obamacare, which was doing disastrously until Donald Trump came along. I think this is an important point about President Trump. Of course, you don't have to agree with everything that President Trump has ever said or ever done, but when Obamacare was crushing under the weight of its own regulatory burden and healthcare costs, Donald Trump could have destroyed the program. Instead, he worked in a bipartisan way to ensure that Americans had access to affordable care. It's not perfect, of course, and there's so much more that we can do. But I think that Donald Trump has earned the right to put in place some better healthcare policies. He's earned it because he did it successfully the first time.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Governor.\\nTIM WALZ: All right, here's where being an old guy gives you some history. I was there at the creation of the ACA, and the reason it was so important is I come from a major healthcare state, home of the Mayo Clinic, home to Medical Alley, 3M, Medtronic, all of those. We understand healthcare. It's why we're ranked first on affordability and accessibility and quality of health care. And so what I know is under Kamala Harris, more people are covered than they have before. Those of you listening, this is critical to you. Now, Donald Trump all of a sudden wants you… go back and remember this. He ran on, the first thing he was going to do on day one, was to repeal Obamacare. On day one, he tried to sign an executive order to repeal the ACA. He signed onto a lawsuit to repeal the ACA, but lost at the Supreme Court. And he would have repealed the ACA had it not been for the courage of John McCain to save that bill. Now fast forward. What that means to you is you lose your pre-existing conditions if you're sitting at home and you got asthma, too bad. If you're a woman, probably not. Broke your foot during football, might kick you out. Your kids get kicked out when they're 26. Kamala Harris negotiated drug prices for the first time with Medicare. We have ten drugs that will come online, the most common ones that'll be there. But look, this issue, and when Donald Trump said, 'I've got a concept of a plan,' it cracked me up as a fourth grade teacher because my kids would have never given me that. But what Senator Vance just explained might be worse than a concept, because what he explained is pre-Obamacare. And I'll make this as simple as possible because I have done this for a long time. What they're saying is if you're healthy, why should you be paying more? So what they're going to do is let insurance companies pick who they insure. Because guess what happens? You pay your premium. It's not much. They figure they're not going to have to pay out to you. But those of you a little older, gray, you know, got cancer? You're going to get kicked out of it. That's why the system didn't work. Kamala Harris will protect and enhance the ACA.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Governor, thank you. Senator, you have not yet explained how you would protect people with preexisting conditions, or laid out that plan.\\nJD VANCE: Well, look, we currently have laws and regulations in place, in place right now that protect people with preexisting conditions. We want to keep those regulations in place, but we also want to make the health insurance marketplace function a little bit better. Now, what Governor Walz just said is actually not true. A lot of what happened and the reason that Obamacare was crushing under its own weight is that a lot of young and healthy people were leaving the exchanges. Donald Trump actually helped address that problem, and he did so in a way that preserved people's access to coverage who had preexisting conditions. But again, something that these guys do, is they make a lot of claims about if Donald Trump becomes President, all of these terrible consequences are going to ensue. But in reality, Donald Trump was President. Inflation was low, take home pay was higher, and he saved the very program from a Democratic administration that was collapsing and would have collapsed absent his leadership. He did his job, which is govern in a bipartisan way and get results, not just complain about problems, but actually solve them.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Governor, did enrollment under the Affordable Care Act go up under the Trump Administration?\\nTIM WALZ: It's higher now that we've seen it go up. Look, people are using it. The system works. And the question about this of young people or whatever, that's the individual mandate piece of this. And Republicans fought tooth and nail, saying, well, Americans should be free to do this. Well, then what happens?\\nJD VANCE: You think the individual mandate's a good idea?\\nTIM WALZ: I think the idea of making sure the risk pool is broad enough to cover everyone, that's the only way insurance works. When it doesn't, it collapses. You are asking pre-ACA where we get people out. Look, people know that they need to be on healthcare. People expect it to be there. And when we are able to make it, and we are making it this way, when we incentivize people to be in the market, when we help people who might not be able to afford it get there, and we make sure then when you get sick and old, it's there for you. Because I heard people say, well, I don't want to buy into Medicare or whatever. Good luck buying healthcare once you get past 70. So look, the ACA works. We can continue to do better. Kamala Harris did that. The way she made everything better was negotiating those ten drugs on Medicare for the first time in American history.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Thank you. Margaret?\\nJD VANCE: Can I address that?\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: We're, I apologize. We're out of time. We have a number of subjects to discuss. Margaret?\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Let's talk about families in America. There is a childcare crisis in this country, and the United States is one of the very few developed countries in the world without a national paid leave program for new parents. Governor Walz, you said that if Democrats win both the White House and Congress, this is a day one priority for you. How long should employers be required to pay workers while they are home taking care of their newborns? You have two minutes.\\nTIM WALZ: Yeah, well, that's negotiable. And that's what Congress worked. But here's what the deal is. Americans sitting out there right now, you may work for a big company. Look, we're home in Minnesota to some of the largest Fortune 500 companies. Kamala Harris knows that in California. Those companies provide paid family medical leave. One is, I think they're moral and they think it's a good thing, but it also keeps their employees healthy. We in Minnesota passed a paid family medical leave. You have a child. You, and I had to go back to work five days after my kids were born. This allows you to stay home a certain amount of time. What we know is that gets the child off to a better start. The family works better. We stay in their employers. We get more consistency in that. So Kamala Harris has made it a priority. We implemented it in Minnesota, and we see growth. That's how you become a pro-business state. But the negotiations on it, and here's the issue, those big companies are able to offer it. Those of you out there who don't have it, just imagine what happens if you get cancer or your child gets sick. We know what happens. You end up staying home. In some places, that means no paycheck, because you've got no protection on that. This is the case of an economy that Donald Trump has set for the wealthiest amongst us. He's willing to give those tax breaks to the wealthiest, he's willing to say, 'Bust those unions up. Do whatever.' What we're saying is the economy works best when it works for all of us. And so a paid family medical leave program, and I will tell you, go to the families or go to the businesses and ask them. As far as childcare on this, you have to take it at both the supply and the demand side. You can't expect the most important people in our lives to take care of our children or our parents, to get paid the least amount of money. And we have to make it easier for folks to be able to get into that business and then to make sure that folks are able to pay for that. We were able to do it in Minnesota, and I'm still telling you this, we were listed as the best state. We're still in crisis on this. A Federal program of paid family medical leave and help with this will enhance our workforce, enhance our families, and make it easier to have the children that you want.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, your time is up. Senator, do you support a national paid leave program? And if so, for how long should employers be mandated to pay their employees while they are home taking care of their newborn? You have two minutes.\\nJD VANCE: Yeah. Well, first of all, Margaret, a number of my Republican colleagues and some Democrats, too, have worked on this issue, and I think there is a bipartisan solution here because a lot of us care about this issue. I mean, look, I speak from this very personally because I'm married to a beautiful woman who is an incredible mother to our three beautiful kids, but is also a very, very brilliant corporate litigator, and I'm so proud of her. But being a working mom, even for somebody with all of the advantages of my wife, is extraordinarily difficult. And it's not just difficult from a policy perspective. She actually had access to paid family leave because she worked for a bigger company. But the cultural pressure on young families, and especially young women, I think, makes it really hard for people to choose the family model they want. A lot of young women would like to go back to work immediately. Some would like to spend a little time home with the kids. Some would like to spend longer at home with the kids. We should have a family care model that makes choice possible. And I think this is a very important substantive difference between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris's approach. I mean, look, if you look at the Federal programs that we have that support paid family leave right now, the community development block grant, and there's another block grant program that spends a lot of money from the federal government. These programs only go to one kind of childcare model. Let's say you'd like your church, maybe, to help you out with child care. Maybe you live in a rural area or an urban area, and you'd like to get together with families in your neighborhood to provide childcare in the way that makes the most sense. You don't get access to any of these federal monies. We want to promote choice in how we deliver family care and how we promote childcare because, look, it is unacceptable. And, you know, of course, Tim and I have been on the campaign trail a lot the past seven or eight weeks. And one of the biggest complaints I hear from young families is people who feel like they don't have options, like they're choosing between going to work or taking care for their kids. That is an incredible burden to put on American families. We're the only country that does it. I think we could do a heck of a lot better.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator, thank you. You have also said, Senator Vance, many things about the American family. The Federal Reserve says parents will spend nearly as much on childcare as they do on housing each month. So I want to get your thoughts on this. President Trump recently said, as much as child care is talked about as being expensive, it's, relatively speaking, not very expensive compared to the kinds of numbers we'll be taking in. Is President Trump committed to the $5,000 per child tax credit that you have described? You have 1 minute.\\nJD VANCE: Well, what President Trump said, Margaret, I just want to defend my running mate here a little bit, is that we're going to be taking in a lot of money by penalizing companies for shipping jobs overseas and penalizing countries who employ slave laborers and then ship their products back into our country and undercut the wages of American workers. It's the heart of the Donald Trump economic plan. Cut taxes for American workers and American families. Cut taxes for businesses that are hiring and building companies in the United States of America. But penalize companies and countries that are shipping jobs overseas. That's the heart of the economic proposal. And I think what President Trump is saying is that when we bring in this additional revenue with higher economic growth, we're going to be able to provide paid family leave, childcare options that are viable and workable for a lot of American families.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Can you clarify how that will solve the childcare shortage?\\nJD VANCE: Well, because, as Tim said, a lot of the childcare shortages, we just don't have enough resources going into the multiple people who could be providing family care options. And we're going to have to, unfortunately, look, we're going to have to spend more money. We're going to have to induce more people to want to provide child care options for American families because the reason it's so expensive right now is because you've got way too few people providing this very essential service.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Thank you, Senator. Governor Walz, your ticket also has some childcare tax credit proposals. Do you think Congress will agree to the $6,000 credit for newborns and $3,000 credit for children over the age of six, as your campaign has promised? Is that realistic?\\nTIM WALZ: Well, well, if these members of Congress are listening to anybody, I can tell you, and this is the biggest issue everybody listening tonight knows. I mean, I'm sure they were shocked to hear it's not that expensive. And let's be clear whether it's $5000 or $6000, that pays you about three or four months. Let's be clear of where we're at on this. It's because we got out of an imbalance on this. We thought we were going to get by by not paying people. I don't think Senator Vance and I are that far apart. I'm not opposed to what he's talking about on options. We've done scholarships, types of things. I think we need to be open to making the case. But the issue here is, the question you asked is you're not going to pay for it with these tariffs. That's just adding another $4,000 on the family and taking less. So not only do they not get the money to pay for that, they're $4,000 in the hole. That's Wharton School. That's his alma mater. And so I think the issue here is those members of Congress, I can't believe they're not here. When I go to businesses, sure, they'll talk about taxes sometimes. But they will lead with childcare and they will lead with housing, because we know the problem is, especially in a state like Minnesota, we need more workers because our economy is growing, but we need the workforce.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, thank you. We need to move on. Norah?\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Let's talk about the State of Democracy, the top issue for Americans after the economy and inflation. After the 2020 election, President Trump's campaign and others filed 62 lawsuits contesting the results. Judges, including those appointed by President Trump and other Republican Presidents looked at the evidence and said there was no widespread fraud. The Governors of every state in the nation, Republicans and Democrats, certified the 2020 election results and sent a legal slate of electors to Congress for January 6th. Senator Vance, you have said you would not have certified the last Presidential election and would have asked the states to submit alternative electors. That has been called unconstitutional and illegal. Would you again seek to challenge this year's election results, even if every Governor certifies the results? I'll give you two minutes.\\nJD VANCE: Well, Norah, first of all, I think that we're focused on the future. We need to figure out how to solve the inflation crisis caused by Kamala Harris's policies. Make housing affordable, make groceries affordable, and that's what we're focused on. But I want to answer your question because you did ask it. Look, what President Trump has said is that there were problems in 2020. And my own belief is that we should fight about those issues, debate those issues peacefully in the public square. And that's all I've said. And that's all that Donald Trump has said. Remember, he said that on January 6th, the protesters ought to protest peacefully. And on January 20th, what happened? Joe Biden became the President. Donald Trump left the White House. And now, of course, unfortunately, we have all of the negative policies that have come from the Harris-Biden administration. I believe that we actually do have a threat to democracy in this country, but unfortunately, it's not the threat to democracy that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz want to talk about. It is the threat of censorship. It's Americans casting aside lifelong friendships because of disagreements over politics. It's big technology companies silencing their fellow citizens. And it's Kamala Harris saying that rather than debate and persuade her fellow Americans, she'd like to censor people who engage in misinformation. I think that is a much bigger threat to democracy than anything that we've seen in this country in the last four years, in the last 40 years. Now I'm really proud, especially given that I was raised by two lifelong blue collar Democrats to have the endorsement of Bobby Kennedy Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard, lifelong leaders in the democratic coalition. And of course, they don't agree with me and Donald Trump on every issue. We don't have to agree on every issue, but we're united behind a basic American First Amendment principle that we ought to debate our differences. We ought to argue about them. We ought to try to persuade our fellow Americans. Kamala Harris is engaged in censorship at an industrial scale. She did it during COVID, she's done it over a number of other issues. And that, to me, is a much bigger threat to democracy than what Donald Trump said when he said that protesters should peacefully protest on January 6th.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor.\\nTIM WALZ: Well, I've enjoyed tonight's debate, and I think there was a lot of commonality here. And I'm sympathetic to misspeaking on things. And I think I might have with the Senator, but…\\nJD VANCE: Me too, man.\\nTIM WALZ: There's one, there's one, though, that this one is troubling to me. And I say that because I think we need to tell the story. Donald Trump refused to acknowledge this. And the fact is, is that I don't think we can be the frog in the pot and let the boiling water go up. He was very clear. I mean, he lost this election, and he said he didn't. One hundred and forty police officers were beaten at the Capitol that day, some with the American flag. Several later died. And it wasn't just in there. In Minnesota, a group gathered on the state capitol grounds in St. Paul and said we're marching to the Governor's residence and there may be casualties. The only person there was my son and his dog, who was rushed out crying by state police. That issue. And Mike Pence standing there as they were chanting, hang Mike Pence. Mike Pence made the right decision. So, Senator, it was adjudicated over and over and over. I worked with kids long enough to know, and I said, as a football coach, sometimes you really want to win, but the democracy is bigger than winning an election. You shake hands and then you try and do everything you can to help the other side win. That's, that's what was at stake here. Now, the thing I'm most concerned about is the idea that imprisoning your political opponents already laying the groundwork for people not accepting this. And a President's words matter. A President's words matter. People hear that. So I think this issue of settling our differences at the ballot box, shaking hands when we lose, being honest about it, but to deny what happened on January 6, the first time in American history that a President or anyone tried to overturn a fair election and the peaceful transfer of power. And here we are four years later in the same boat. I will tell you this, that when this is over, we need to shake hands, this election, and the winner needs to be the winner. This has got to stop. It's tearing our country apart.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Margaret.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Vance, did you want to respond to that?\\nJD VANCE: Yeah, well, look, Tim, first of all, it's really rich for Democratic leaders to say that Donald Trump is a unique threat to democracy when he peacefully gave over power on January the 20th, as we have done for 250 years in this country. We are going to shake hands after this debate and after this election. And of course, I hope that we win, and I think we're going to win. But if Tim Walz is the next vice president, he'll have my prayers, he'll have my best wishes, and he'll have my help whenever he wants it. But we have to remember that for years in this country, Democrats protested the results of elections. Hillary Clinton in 2016 said that Donald Trump had the election stolen by Vladimir Putin because the Russians bought, like, $500,000 worth of Facebook ads. This has been going on for a long time. And if we want to say that we need to respect the results of the election, I'm on board. But if we want to say, as Tim Walz is saying, that this is just a problem that Republicans have had. I don't buy that.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Governor.\\nTIM WALZ: January 6th was not Facebook ads. And I think a revisionist history on this. Look, I don't understand how we got to this point, but the issue was that happened. Donald Trump can even do it. And all of us say there's no place for this. It has massive repercussions. This idea that there's censorship to stop people from doing, threatening to kill someone, threatening to do something, that's not censorship. Censorship is book banning. We've seen that. We've seen that brought up. I just think for everyone tonight, and I'm going to thank Senator Vance. I think this is the conversation they want to hear, and I think there's a lot of agreement. But this is one that we are miles apart on. This was a threat to our democracy in a way that we had not seen. And it manifested itself because of Donald Trump's inability to say, he is still saying he didn't lose the election. I would just ask that. Did he lose the 2020 election?\\nJD VANCE: Tim, I'm focused on the future. Did Kamala Harris censor Americans from speaking their mind in the wake of the 2020 COVID situation?\\nTIM WALZ: That is a damning. That is a damning non answer.\\nJD VANCE: It's a damning non answer for you to not talk about censorship. Obviously, Donald Trump and I think that there were problems in 2020. We've talked about it. I'm happy to talk about it further. But you guys attack us for not believing in democracy. The most sacred right under the United States democracy is the First Amendment. You yourself have said there's no First Amendment right to misinformation. Kamala Harris wants to use the power of government and big tech to silence people from speaking their minds. That is a threat to democracy that will long outlive this present political moment. I would like Democrats and Republicans to both reject censorship. Let's persuade one another. Let's argue about ideas, and then let's come together afterwards.\\nTIM WALZ: You can't yell fire in a crowded theater. That's the test. That's the Supreme court test.\\nJD VANCE: Tim. Fire in a crowded theater. You guys wanted to kick people off of Facebook for saying that toddlers should not wear masks.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Senator, the governor does have the floor.\\nTIM WALZ: Sorry.\\nJD VANCE: That's not fire in a crowded theater. That is criticizing the policies of the government, which is the right of every American.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Senator, the governor does have the floor for 1 minute to respond to you.\\nTIM WALZ: Please. Yeah, well, I don't run Facebook. What I do know is I see a candidate out there who refused, and now again. And this, I'm pretty shocked by this. He lost the election. This is not a debate. It's not anything anywhere other than in Donald Trump's world, because, look, when Mike Pence made that decision to certify that election, that's why Mike Pence isn't on this stage. What I'm concerned about is where is the firewall with Donald Trump? Where is the firewall if he knows he could do anything, including taking an election and his Vice President's not going to stand to it. That's what we're asking you, America. Will you stand up? Will you keep your oath of office even if the President doesn't? And I think Kamala Harris would agree. She wouldn't have picked me if she didn't think I would do that because, of course, that's what we would do. So, America, I think you've got a really clear choice on this election of who's going to honor that democracy and who's going to honor Donald Trump.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor, your time is up. Thank you, gentlemen. We will be right back with both of our candidates. The CB's news vice presidential debate continues.\\nSegment 3\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: Welcome back to the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. It is now time for the closing statement. Senator Vance won the virtual coin toss and elected to go last. So, Governor Walz, you are first. You have two minutes.\\nTIM WALZ: Well, thank you, Senator Vance. Thank you to CBS News. And most importantly, thank you to all of you. If you're still up and the folks who miss Dancing with the Stars, I appreciate it. But look, the support of the democracy matters. It matters that you're here. And I'm as surprised as anybody of this coalition that Kamala Harris has built. From Bernie Sanders to Dick Cheney to Taylor Swift and a whole bunch of folks in between there. And they don't all agree on everything, but they are truly optimistic people. They believe in a positive future of this country. And one where our politics can be better than it is. And I have to tell you that, that better than it is is the sense of optimism that there can be an opportunity economy that works for everyone, not just to get by, but to get ahead. And the idea that freedom really means something. Not the freedom of government to be in your bedroom or exam room, but the freedom for you to make choices about yourself. Now, look, we all know who Donald Trump is. He's told us. And as Maya Angelou said, 'Believe him when he told you that.' His first inaugural address talked about American carnage and then he spent four years trying to maybe do that. Senator Vance tonight made it clear he will stand with Donald Trump's agenda. He will continue to push down that road. Excuse me. Kamala Harris gives us a different option. Now, I have to tell you, I'm going to be careful about the quotes, but there's one that Senator Vance said that does resonate with me. He said, 'Donald Trump makes the people I care about afraid.' A lot of America feels that way. We don't need to be afraid. Franklin Roosevelt was right. 'All we have to fear is fear itself.' Kamala Harris is bringing us a new way forward. She's bringing us a politics of joy. She's bringing real solutions for the middle class. And she's centering you at the heart of that, all the while asking everyone, 'Join this movement. Make your voices heard. Let's look for a new day where everybody gets that opportunity and everybody gets a chance to thrive.' I humbly ask for your vote on November 5 for Kamala Harris.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Governor Walz. Thank you. Senator Vance, your closing statement.\\nJD VANCE: Well, I want to thank Governor Walz, you folks at CBS and, of course, the American people for tuning in this evening. And one of the issues we didn't talk about was energy. And I remember when I was being raised by my grandmother, when she didn't have enough money to turn on the heat some nights because Ohio gets pretty cold at night and because money was often very tight. And I believe, as a person who wants to be your next Vice President, that we are a rich and prosperous enough country where every American, whether they're rich or poor, ought to be able to turn on their heat in the middle of a cold winter night. That's gotten more difficult thanks to Kamala Harris's energy policies. I believe that whether you're rich or poor, you ought to be able to afford a nice meal for your family. That's gotten harder because of Kamala Harris's policies. I believe that whether you're rich or poor you ought to be able to afford to buy a house. You ought to be able to live in safe neighborhoods. You ought to not have your communities flooded with fentanyl. And that, too, has gotten harder with Kamala, because of Kamala Harris's policies. Now, I've been in politics long enough to do what Kamala Harris does when she stands before the American people and says that on day one she's gonna work on all these challenges I just listed. She's been the Vice President for three and a half years. Day one was 1400 days ago. And her policies have made these problems worse. Now I believe that we have the most beautiful country in the world. I meet people on the campaign trail who can't afford food, but have the grace and generosity to ask me how I'm doing and to tell me they're praying for my family. What that has taught me is that we have the greatest country, the most beautiful country, the most incredible people anywhere in the world. But they're not going to be able to achieve their full dreams with the broken leadership that we have in Washington. They're not going to be able to live their American Dream if we do the same thing that we've been doing for the last three and a half years. We need change. We need a new direction. We need a President who has already done this once before and did it well. Please vote for Donald Trump. And whether you vote for me or vote for Tim Walz, I just want to say I'm so proud to be doing this, and I'm rooting for you. God bless you and good night.\\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Vance, thank you. And thank you both for participating in the only Vice Presidential debate of this election cycle. I'm Margaret Brennan.\\nNORAH O'DONNELL: And I'm Norah O'Donnell. And a reminder, there are just 35 days until election day. Please get out and vote. And for all of us here at CBS News, thank you.\",\n",

Juliet football long snapper Jaxon Rocchietti was in stable condition at a Vanderbilt Medical Center intensive care unit on Tuesday with a traumatic brain injury, following a car accident in Wilson County last weekend.\\nRocchietti has brain function and has been able to sleep after being diagnosed with a Grade 1 diffuse axonal injury, his father, Matt, said. DAIs are caused by tears in the connective brain fibers.\\nHis father is the Bears tight end coach and has been an assistant with head coach Trey Perry for the past 10 TSSAA football seasons.\\n'He's in a good spot for people who've had traumatic brain injuries like his,' his father said. 'It's still going to be a long road of physical therapy and cognitive therapy and probably some speech therapy, we don't know for sure.

       "   'summary': \"October often has been unkind to Tennessee football.\\nHaving Alabama has an annual opponent on the third week of October had something to do that. But even without the Tide, UT's October schedule often could be daunting.\\nThis October should be different – in a good way.\\nAlabama remains as an October regular. However, there are only two other games, both against unranked opponents. Arkansas on Saturday will account for the only road test. Florida will come to Neyland Stadium the following week, and an open date awaits the Vols after the Alabama game.\\nThat contrasts sharply with the troubles October so frequently has presented, starting in 2008 when Tennessee took a tumble that would have a long-lasting effect.\\nFrom 2008-23, Tennessee played at least two nationally ranked opponents every year except three. And in two of those seasons when it played only one nationally ranked opponent it was against the nation's No. 1 team.\\nThe Vols haven't just won four consecutive games. They have won them all by double-figure margins and have covered the point spread as well.\\nThat won't change if the Vols crank up their passing game in Fayetteville. UAB's Jacob Zeno passed for 235 yards and three touchdowns against the Razorbacks. Oklahoma State's Alex Bowman passed for 326 yards and a touchdown.\\nOle Miss 34, South Carolina 24: The Gamecocks almost upset LSU at Williams-Brice Stadium. They would have had a better shot at upsetting the Rebels if Kentucky hadn't delivered a wake-up call to Ole Miss last week in Oxford.\\nAt least, I think it was a wake-up call for a team that looked capable of making the playoffs. If Ole Miss loses to the Gamecocks, you should Google former New Orleans Saints coach Jim Mora's press-conference rant on 'playoffs.'\\nOn second thought, Google it regardless of the outcome. It's funny.\\nFlorida 35, UCF 34: Gators coach Billy Napier said during the open week the Gators need to become more consistent.\\nI thought they had been consistent.\\nWhen they meet a reasonably talented opponent (See Texas A&M and Miami for details) in The Swamp, they get manhandled. How's that for consistency?\\nSo, perhaps if Florida is less consistent, it can beat a UCF team that made Colorado look more like a playoff contender than its usual clown show in a 48-21 loss last week.\\nAlabama 41, Vanderbilt 17: This is a historical mismatch of epic proportions.\\nThe Tide haven't won fewer than 10 games since 2007. Vanderbilt has never won 10 games in a season.\\nHowever, the Commodores did go 9-0 in 1904 when they averaged 52.4 points per game and allowed only four points. Fortunately for the Tide, they weren't on Vanderbilt's schedule that season.\\nGeorgia 37, Auburn 14: Imagine how much better Auburn's offense would be if it had signed wide receiver Ryan Williams, who is starring as a freshman at Alabama.\\nOops. I forgot that if you want four- and five-star receivers to shine, you need a four-star or better quarterback. Auburn is a couple of stars short of that, which coach Hugh Freeze will be quick to tell you after another loss.\\nMissouri 27, Texas A&M 24: The Tigers have made it this far without a road test. Although the Aggies haven't been impressive on offense in a 4-1 start, Kyle Field isn't an accommodating venue for visitors.\\nMissouri also has been unimpressive despite its 4-0 start, which raises the question: If you need two overtimes to beat Vanderbilt, should that really count as a victory?\\nNonetheless, I trust Missouri's quarterback (Brady Cook) more than the Aggies' quarterback (whoever that might be).\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Show Caption\\n(This story was updated to add a video.)\\nWith abortion concerns continuing to weigh on his campaign, former President Donald Trump said Tuesday he would veto a national abortion ban if one crossed his desk as president, and his running mate JD Vance said the GOP needs to 'earn people's trust' on the issue.\\nMany states have passed strict new limits on abortion since a Supreme Court remade by Trump appointees overturned Roe v Wade, the decades-old decision protecting abortion rights.\\nTrump has praised the ruling, saying the issue should be left to the states, but has also sought to reassure voters concerned about new restrictions. Trump said during a debate last month that he would not sign a national abortion ban, but repeatedly refused to say whether he'd veto one.\\nAfter the abortion issue came up again during the vice presidential debate Tuesday, Trump declared on Truth Social that 'EVERYONE KNOWS I WOULD NOT SUPPORT A FEDERAL ABORTION BAN, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, AND WOULD, IN FACT, VETO IT.'\\nAbortion has proven a thorny issue for Trump, who has tried to distance himself from more extreme elements of his party as polls show most voters support abortion rights. He has been forced to backtrack at times, though, after backlash from the right, as when he came out recently against a ballot measure in Florida protecting abortion rights.\\nVance also sought to soften the GOP's image on abortion during Tuesday's debate. He conceded his party has a trust problem when it comes to the issue.\\nVance cited the story of a woman who is 'very dear to me' who told him 'a couple years ago that she felt like if she hadn't had that abortion that it would have destroyed her life because she was in an abusive relationship.'\\n'I think that what I take from that, as a Republican who proudly wants to protect innocent life in this country, who proudly wants to protect the vulnerable, is that my party we've got to do so much better of a job at earning the American people's trust back on this issue, where they frankly just don't trust us,' Vance said.\\nHe went on to argue that he and Trump are doing that by promoting pro-family policies, such as fertility treatments and helping families financially. He also defended Trump's position that abortion regulation should be left up to the states.\\nDemocratic candidate for vice president Tim Walz said that leaving abortion up to the states has put pregnant women at risk, citing the case of Amber Thurman, a Georgia woman who died after a long delay in getting a procedure to clear fetal tissue from her body that hadn't been fully expelled after she took abortion bills, according to ProPublica. A medical panel ruled Thurman's death was 'preventable.'\\nWalz said Thurman's death is the result of a basic right being 'determined by geography.'\\n'I agree with you, Amber Thurman should still be alive,' Vance said.\",\n",

       "   'summary': 'Vanderbilt football fans stormed the field on Saturday to celebrate a major victory over No. 2 Alabama, knowing it could come at a cost.\\nOn Sunday, the Southeastern Conference announced it was fining Vanderbilt $100,000 for storming the field. Arkansas, which defeated No. 4 Tennessee, was fined $250,000 for a second offense. Even with the steep fine, it\\'ll be worth it for the Commodores \\' fateful. The win was the first over Alabama since 1984 and the first win in 61 games over a team ranked in the top five of the Associated Press Poll.\\nIn a news release on Sunday, the conference announced that the fine for the Commodores and Razorbacks comes under the league\\'s current access to competition area policy, revised at the SEC Spring Meetings in 2023. Fines are paid to the opposing institution for conference games. So Vanderbilt will pay Alabama $100,000 for the upset victory.\\nThis was Arkansas\\' second offense since the new agreement was put in place, as the Razorbacks also rushed the court when the men\\'s basketball team beat Duke on Nov. 29, 2023. That storming incurred a $100,000 fine.\\n\"The policy states that \\'institutions shall limit access to competition areas to participating student-athletes, coaches, officials, support personnel and properly credentialed or authorized individuals at all times. For the safety of participants and spectators alike, at no time before, during or after a contest may spectators enter the competition area.\\'\\n\"Financial penalties are imposed for violations in all sports sponsored by the Conference. Institutional penalties range from $100,000 for a first offense, $250,000 for a second offense and $500,000 for a third and subsequent offenses.\\n\"The policy was originally adopted by a vote of Conference members in 2004 and financial penalties were increased by action taken by the membership in 2015 and again in 2023.\"\\nFollowing Saturday\\'s contest, following the field storming, a Tennessee player shoved an Arkansas fan in videos shared on social media. This shows one of the impacts of why the SEC fines schools for fans storming the field.\\nVanderbilt fans and students took down the goalpost in the end zone, carrying it for more than two miles before throwing it into the Cumberland River to celebrate the upset.',\n",

       "   'summary': \"If Trump actually cared about soaring prices, he would be wise to return to the GOP free trade policies of old. Taxing other nations will inevitably raise prices for the American consumer.\\nShow Caption\\nConservatives can agree that the Biden administration has been disastrous for the American economy. Many of us are worried about another four years of rising prices and the strain that would put on everyday Americans.\\nHowever, despite his claims that he would restore the American economy, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump seems committed to some of the same policy mistakes he made during his first term that actively harmed American households, allowing Vice President Kamala Harris to attack him and Republicans on the issue.\\nYou don't have to look too far back to see how broken Trump's economic ideas were or to realize he wants to do them again.\\nTrump's populist economic plans appeal to his voters, but won't help\\nTrump's populist economics policies are chock full of tariffs, which appeal to his base but are bad policies in practice.\\nTariffs tax the import of goods from foreign countries. Team Trump argues that tariffs are a tax only on the affected nation, not the American consumer. However, a new survey indicates that 95% of economists disagree with that sentiment, noting that the likely outcome of such policies is higher prices for the American consumer.\\nThese tariffs are inevitably baked into the cost of the very goods affected, being passed on directly to consumers. This is exactly what happened when Trump enacted tariffs on China, along with aluminum and steel, from across the world. A report from the Tax Foundation found that these programs ended up costing the average American household hundreds of dollars annually.\\nOpinion: I was wrong about Vance. VP debate shows Republicans can win because of him.\\nMoreover, the entire purpose of tariffs is to raise prices among imported goods in order to incentivize domestic production and consumption through lower relative costs. The reality, however, is that tariffs give domestic companies room to raise their own prices, generally proportionately to the import tax increase from other nations.\\nHarris is right to call Trump's plan a 'sales tax on the American people,' even if her proposals aren't any better.\\nIf Trump actually cared about soaring prices, he would be wise to return to the GOP free trade policies of old. Instead, he would rather sell false promises to his voters. Taxing other nations cannot make up for our reckless federal spending and will inevitably raise prices for the American consumer.\\nDuring Tuesday's vice presidential debate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, embraced these same policies, praising President Joe Biden for leaving much of the Trump tariffs in place.\\nHowever, in response, despite his own sympathy for the policies, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz highlighted that America's trade deficit reached record highs under Trump's presidency despite his trade policy.\\nTrump has held an advantage on the economy, but it's slipping\\nThe number one issue for Americans this election cycle is the economy. Between years of high inflation and the lingering economic stresses of the COVID-19 pandemic, Americans yearn for the economic success of the 2010s.\\nFrom 2020 until this May, food prices have risen 26% (with many household goods rising by more), and the more volatile gas prices remained significantly higher over the course of Biden's presidency than they did under Trump.\\nWages have gone up alongside these price increases, but not enough for people to feel they're keeping up.\\nAmericans primarily blame the government for high inflation, and regardless of what portion of the blame Biden deserves, he and his party will be held responsible by Americans.\\nThis is Trump's biggest advantage in this election. The economy was great during Trump's first term in office before COVID-19, and polls over recent years have indicated that Americans trusted him more than Biden.\\nHowever, recent polls show Harris and Trump are essentially tied on the issue, with Harris even leading in certain surveys.\\nTrump's grip on the issue is slipping from earlier this year, even when he was running against Biden. Given that Harris has closed the gap in the economy in recent polls, voters are not universally tying the economic failures of the Biden administration to Harris.\\nTrump would benefit from a coherent plan for the economy, one that doesn't have so many holes. Instead, he made it easy for Harris to dispute his claim to be America's economic savior if he was only given power.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Compared to the original Jeep — you know, the military vehicle — the 2025 Wrangler JL is a spaceship, even though by modern standards it's a very old-school vehicle when compared to, say, the Ford Bronco or Toyota 4Runner. But father time, or, at least, father progress, is starting to catch up with the Wrangler, which is finally losing its manual crank-handle windows (as does the 2025 Gladiator, the Wrangler's de-facto pickup sibling). The good news for anyone yearning for yesteryear is that the manual six-speed transmission is still around, even though for 2025 it becomes the only transmission choice for the Wrangler's standard V-6 engine. Want an automatic? You're automatically upgraded to the Jeep's optional turbocharged 2.0-liter I-4.\\nIt's probably a bit of a reach to say that the Wrangler JL is a stone-age vehicle. It features a modern five-link suspension system, electronic lockers and nearly as much technology as those two aforementioned competitors do. The new JL also comes as a plug-in hybrid (PHEV) powerplant, something that the 4Runner is only just getting with its i-Force Max hybrid engine — just without the plug-in option — while the Bronco still doesn't have an electrified version, yet. Oh, and there's its newly standard 12.3-inch touchscreen that can magic-whiz-bang connect wirelessly to your smartphone.\\nAnd yet, the Wrangler's continued use of live axles front and rear, doors that can easily be removed and generally simple layout give it that old-school feeling that made the standard crank windows not seem so out of place.\\n2024 Jeep Wrangler 4xe Dispatcher:\\nAlas, time moves on. The Jeep's previously optional power windows and door locks are now standard fare. Whatever cost increase these represent on Jeep's end are probably more than made up for by the streamlined trim structure and reduced build complexity — no more producing different doors for different Wranglers. And, fortunately, it won't make taking the doors off any harder, really. As with all power-window, power-door-lock Wranglers until now, you need only unclip an electrical connector in addition to the usual unbolting process for the hinges.\\nThe other good news for those who like to have everything in their control is that the 3.6-liter Pentastar V-6 will now come coupled exclusively to a six-speed manual transmission. The automatic transmission option for that engine has been dropped, meaning those who want a computer doing their shifting will need to opt for the turbocharged 2.0-liter I-4 engine; the pair costs $2,500 on every trim level save the Sahara, where it's standard, and the plug-in hybrid 4xe and Wrangler 392 models, where the gas-only 2.0-liter isn't available (because, you know, one has the plug-in version of the 2.0-liter and the other gets a 6.4-liter Hemi V-8, both of which retain their eight-speed automatics).\\nA reminder that the 4xe blends the 2.0-liter and an electric motor to deliver 375 hp and 470 lb-ft of torque, but you won't be able to get it in the stripped-out Sport trim. The 4xe starts at the Sport S and will be available for every trim after — except the Rubicon 392, of course — including the new High Altitude that will become available later this year. It also gains an exclusive Black/Mantis Green interior color.\\nFinally, a new color for 2025 is available known as ''41,' an olive drab green from the Jeep '41 Concept of the 2022 Easter Jeep Safari. It's a perfect way to celebrate its GP heritage with a proper, factory-applied military-style green body color and joins the seven other body colors of Anvil, Black, Bright White, Fathom Blue, Firecracker Red, Granite Crystal and Hydro Blue.\",\n",

       "   'summary': 'When Michigan voters cast their ballots for president, they say a strong motivator is what they expect their candidate will do if sent to the White House.\\nBut in many elections, voters are also motivated, in whole or in part, by fear of what their candidate\\'s opponent might or will do, if elected. That may be especially true this year.\\nThe USA TODAY Network\\'s Detroit Free Press asked supporters of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump who attended a rally Thursday at Saginaw Valley State University in Saginaw, Michigan, to describe their greatest fear if Vice President Kamala Harris is elected Nov. 5. The Free Press also asked Harris supporters who attended a Friday campaign event in Flint, Michigan, to say what they feared most about a second Trump presidency.\\nHere\\'s what they had to say.\\nWhat Trump supporters told us\\nChris Monk of Montrose, Michigan, who pre-loads UPS trucks and is a member of the Teamsters union, saw Trump speak in person for the second time in Saginaw Thursday after earlier attending a Trump \"town hall\" event in Flint on Sept. 17.\\n\"Communism — straight up,\" Monk said when asked what her greatest fear is of a Harris presidency. \"She\\'s not for the people. She\\'s for herself and her elite squad.\"\\nMonk said she believes the economy \"is already suffering\" and will suffer further if Harris is elected. As vice president for nearly four years, Harris has already had a chance to address inflation and take other actions she has promised if elected president, but has not done so, Monk said.\\n\"I\\'m here to support Trump because I believe he is for the people and this is what we need in leadership of our country.\"\\nScott Doyen, a Bay City, Michigan, construction contractor who enjoys drag racing as a hobby, brought to Trump\\'s Saginaw event his 1967 Chevy II Nova Super Sport, which was built for racing with a 2,000-horsepower engine. Doyen recently decorated the dragster with the viral image of Trump, bloodied and fist raised, surrounded by Secret Service agents after a gunman fired shots at him at a campaign event in Pennsylvania on July 13.\\n\"Open borders\" are Doyen\\'s greatest fear under a Harris presidency, he said. If undocumented migrants continue to cross the border in large numbers, \"how many of those are gang members and criminals?\" he asked.\\nAs a residential home builder, Doyen believes he has faced competition from work performed at lower cost using the labor of undocumented migrants and he said he has also heard the complaints of customers left with low-quality work. \"Quality costs money,\" he said. \"Cheap labor isn\\'t quality.\"\\nHarris \"just doesn\\'t care about the American people,\" Doyen said. \"If she would get elected, it\\'s going to be the American people who are going to regret it.\"\\nFrankenmuth, Michigan, resident Sarah O\\'Dea attended the Trump Saginaw event with her husband Stan after earlier attending a Trump rally in nearby Freeland, Michigan, on May 1 and the Flint town hall in September.\\n\"The border issue, the immigration, groceries,\" O\\'Dea said when asked about her greatest fear of a Harris presidency.\\n\"This is the first time in my life that I have ever used a calculator while in the grocery store,\" and \"it\\'s obscene,\" O\\'Dea said.\\n\"We love Trump because we want to see America go back to how it was when he was president.\"\\nWhat Harris supporters told us\\nShonda Edgerle, 51, of Lapeer, Michigan, is a team leader at Flint Assembly where General Motors builds Chevrolet and GMC pickups.\\nShe came out to the Harris rally in Flint to show her support. She said she knows many people who, like her, support Harris, but are afraid to say so because they don\\'t want to be harassed by Trump supporters.\\nShe said she fears Trump would attack abortion rights if he wins and pursue an extreme agenda.\\n\\'I just think it\\'s just scary to me, because I\\'m a big \\'Handmaid\\'s Tale\\' fan, but I don\\'t want to live that life,\\' she said. \\'I feel like with the Project 2025, it is to me, mirroring that. I\\'m afraid. I\\'m really afraid.\"\\nLaShawn Lenton, 53, of Flint Township, Michigan, worked 13 years as a corrections officer and now helps manage a senior living community. Her biggest fear about a Trump victory?\\n\\'That he would become a dictator and our freedoms would be taken away,\\' she said. \\'I have children and grandchildren. I really believe that when it comes to female rights, that we should have them. I am pro-life. I really am, but I feel that no one should control what a woman can do with her body, especially not the government.\"\\nEugene Behme, 66, of Flint is a pipefitter for Chrysler. He said he came to the rally Friday because he \\'wanted a big crowd number to piss off Trump.\"\\nHe joked that his biggest fear if Trump wins again is that he\\'d have to move to Canada. Behme said Trump\\'s actions on Jan. 6, 2021, are more than disqualifying and he fears what will happen if he gets back in.\\n\"He\\'s got an army. He does have an army of followers. That was obvious with January 6,\" Behme said. \"There are these people, this cult, that is following his every word. And so if he gets re-elected, his army will be back out onto the streets again, what kind of power would he have with this military? Michigan militia, all the militia groups that are out there, they\\'re supporting him. It\\'s scary.\"\\nJames Logie, 27, of Flint has epilepsy and lives on about $1,000 a month in disability benefits.\\nSome months, his medication costs run $500. He said Harris and President Biden have worked to lower prescription costs for people like him. He said he worries what would have happened to his care under Trump.\\nHe said he fears that if Trump wins, he will implement a detailed policy plan known as Project 2025.\\n\\'I hear a lot about Project 2025, and all the different ways that that can affect everybody, as far as women and their reproductive rights, the sales tax,\\' he said. \\'And I don\\'t know if there\\'s anything in there about healthcare, but it\\'s, it\\'s pretty scary, the things I have heard about it.\\'',\n",

       "   'excerpt': \"Battle Ground Academy's Kaedyn Marable has put up gaudy passing totals during the 2024 TSSAA football season, leading the Wildcats to a 6-1 start.\",\n",
       "   'summary': 'HENDERSONVILLE – The Midstate\\'s leading passer had another typical night at the office Friday night.\\nBattle Ground Academy quarterback Kaedyn Marable was nearly perfect through the air, completing 14 of 15 passes for 215 yards and three touchdowns. The junior added 41 yards and another touchdown on six rushing attempts.\\nHe did it all without so much as putting his helmet on in the second half.\\nMarable and BGA routed Pope John Paul II, 61-10, scoring on every offensive drive and sending the game to a running clock in the third quarter as the Wildcats\\' starters rested. It\\'s the third time BGA (6-1, 2-1 DII-A Middle Region) has eclipsed the 60-point total this fall, thanks to a high-octane offensive system installed by first-year coach Bobby Bentley.\\nNo system can become fully operational without the right players, and Bentley didn\\'t need much time to see that he had the right quarterback when he arrived at BGA. He watched film of Marable\\'s sophomore season, one in which he threw for 1,888 yards and 21 touchdowns with a 62% completion percentage, and came away impressed with his accuracy and quick-twitch athleticism.\\nTSSAA football scores for Week 7 of 2024 season\\n\"He\\'s very intelligent,\" Bentley said. \"The things that he sees, he sees it one time and he kind of knows the teachable moment of it. He knows how to check an audible. ... Whatever you tell him to do as a coach, he\\'s gonna do it.\"\\nThat intelligence is how you get Marable praising Bentley\\'s offense — which includes plays with as many as three passing reads — for its simplicity. He\\'s certainly made it look that way. After Friday, Marable is 118-of-162 for 1,817 yards, 19 touchdowns and zero interceptions, while BGA averages 45 points per game.\\nMarable\\'s been watching more film in his second season as the Wildcats\\' starter, and he\\'s put 15 pounds on his 6-foot-3, 170-pound frame. The extra muscle mass has helped him take more hits and improved his effectiveness as a runner — he\\'s picked up 211 yards and scored nine touchdowns on the ground, compared to just seven rushing yards in 2023.\\nBentley, a former Power 5 assistant at Auburn and South Carolina who rose to prominence coaching Byrnes High School in South Carolina from 1995-2006, likened Marable to one of his stars at Byrnes, Trey Elder. Elder won the state\\'s Mr. Football award as a senior in 2003 and went on to play at Appalachian State, where he won three national championships as a backup quarterback.\\n\"(Marable) can run like Trey,\" Bentley said. \"Trey\\'s very, very similar, very accurate. Kaedyn doesn\\'t miss open receivers.\"\\nAnd in the Wildcats\\' offense, there are usually plenty of them. Senior Arnett Hayes, the team\\'s leader in receptions and yards, had four catches for 75 yards and two touchdowns against JPII (3-4, 3-2). Senior Locke Kennedy and sophomore Fletcher Fields both have FBS offers. Marable just focuses on getting them the ball and hoping the rest takes care of itself.\\n\"I don\\'t really pay attention to (my statistics) too much,\" he said. \"I just like winning, no matter what it takes.\"',\n",

When that magnetic activity is released, it creates intense bursts of radiation resulting in solar flares – considered by NASA to be our solar system\\'s largest explosive events.\\nSolar flares emit radiation commonly in the form of ultraviolet light and X-rays that can hurtle toward Earth at the speed of light. Some of these flares can be accompanied by coronal mass ejections, or clouds of plasma and charged particles, that emerge from the sun\\'s outermost atmosphere, the corona.\\nThese ejections can collide with Earth\\'s magnetosphere, the barrier protecting humanity from the harshest impacts of space weather, to produce geomagnetic storms.\\nAs auroras form, Earth\\'s magnetic field redirects the particles toward the poles through a process that produces a stunning display of rays, spirals and flickers that has fascinated humans for millennia.

Josh Hawley, R-Missouri. His Capping Credit Card Interest Rates Act would cap the annual percentage rate (APR) for credit cards at 18%, outlaw new fees to evade the cap, and penalize companies for non-compliance. While the measure isn't conservative policy, Hawley's figure matches the current APR cap imposed by the National Credit Union Administration under the Federal Credit Union Act.\\nHawley, at the very least, has the rhetorical fig leaf that he's trying to level the playing field for all credit card issuers.\\nI had assumed that Democrats, who generally don't mind meddling in the marketplace, would naturally impose more strident caps. In June of 2023, U.S. Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, Jack Reed, D-Rhode Island, Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, and Sanders introduced The Empowering States' Rights to Protect Consumers Act which simply allows states to impose interest rate caps on credit cards. When the Democrats channel their inner federalism, we're living in strange times indeed.\\nI pushed even further back.\\nIn 2019, Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez also proposed capping credit cards and consumer loans at 15%. 'There is no reason a person should pay more than 15% interest in the United States,' Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. 'It's a debt trap for working people + it has to end.'\\nThink about that for a minute. Trump's proposal is even more restrictive than two actual socialists in Congress felt comfortable proposing.\\nI'm perfectly fine with disclosure laws which require lenders to put interest rates in giant font to make sure a consumer doesn't miss them. Expecting a summary of terms so the details aren't buried throughout pages of fine print is reasonable. Republicans applauding what can only be characterized as government-mandated price controls is nuts.\\nYes, I'm aware that credit card companies engender the same feelings as an encounter with a tarantula. They're easy to attack as faceless corporate engines which profit off Americans in economic distress.\\nIn the second quarter of 2024, credit card balances increased by $27 billion to $1.14 trillion. We're a nation in debt on so many levels.\\nNevertheless, credit card rate caps only make sense if you believe that Americans are inherently entitled to other peoples' money.\\nAmericans who depend on credit cards could lose access to them\\nThe best way to deal with debt is to avoid it in the first place. All of us have to make tough choices about prioritizing our limited resources. Regrettably, we're led by politicians who refuse to do the same.\\nWhen Congress spends trillions of dollars it doesn't have, the American people are on the hook for the bill and even more through inflation. When the inflation runs high, Americans take on credit card debt to make ends meet. Instead of making tough choices on spending to address the issue, Trump has proposed a credit card interest gimmick instead.\\nIt's worse than it sounds.\\nTrump plans to cut the average credit card interest rate of 21.51% by more than half. Guess who will lose their credit cards first? It isn't wealthy Americans with high credit scores. The American Bankers Association has been perfectly clear on the matter:\\n'While we don't know the specific details of this proposal, ABA has opposed similar interest rate cap proposals in the past, including one from Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez during the 2020 campaign, because they would result in the loss of credit for the very consumers who need it the most,' the American Bankers Association (ABA) explained on CNBC.\\nThe whole scenario is basically a math problem. If Trump sets credit card APRs at 10%, banks will only extend credit to Americans with income levels, credit scores, and debt loads that allow them to be profitable. Everyone else who needs access to credit will be left to deal with payday lenders and loan sharks.\\nRunning down the stretch to November, Trump has managed to throw conservative principles under the bus yet again while advocating for a policy which will actually hurt those it is designed to help. Republicans can cheer for this kind of politically driven nonsense or claim to be conservative. We can't do both.\",\n",

       "   'excerpt': 'Filip Forsberg talks about his foot injury and the birth of his son in \"FACEOFF: Inside the NHL\" which is now streaming on Prime Video.',\n",
       "   'summary': 'Nashville Predators forward Filip Forsberg is featured in \"FACEOFF: Inside the NHL\" which is now streaming on Amazon Prime Video.\\nForsberg is one of several NHL stars in the series which premiered on Oct. 4. Forsberg is a central part of the second episode. We get an inside look at how Forsberg dealt with last season\\'s painful foot injury, the grueling mental and physical side of hockey, and the moment he and wife Erin Alvey welcomed the birth of their son, Felix.\\nHere\\'s four things we learned about Forsberg in the series.\\nFilip Forsberg has a meticulous game-day routine\\nMost NHL players have specific game day routine − Forsberg is no exception.\\nHe wakes up at 8:08 a.m. every day during the season. Not 8:00, 8:05, or 8:10 − 8:08 on the dot. Then, before games, he puts on his skates at exactly 7:07.\\n\"For a normal person, that\\'s probably weird. But for (hockey players) it\\'s just a routine that we have,\" Forsberg said.\\nWaking up at the same time, eating the same pre-game meal, going through the same pre-game workout − it\\'s all part of mental preparation Forsberg needs to get into game mode.\\n\"When you speak it out loud, it\\'s pretty silly,\" Forsberg said.\\nForsberg needed electronic stimulation, dry needle therapy for foot injury\\nThe nagging foot injury that kept Forsberg from practicing most of last season came after a blocked shot in the Predators \\' 4-2 loss to the Devils on Feb. 13.\\nIn the series, we see what Forsberg had to go through to keep playing through the pain.\\nIn addition to physical training focused on strengthening his ankle, Forsberg needed dry needling and electric stimulation to help encourage blood flow to the area.\\n\"He\\'s trying to heal it, but then he\\'s irritating it every other night by playing,\" said Dr. Mike Prebeg, Forsberg\\'s physical therapist.\\nThe extra therapy on his foot allowed Forsberg to have the best season of his career. He set the Predators\\' single season goals record, scoring 48 goals to break Matt Duchene\\'s record of 43 set in 2022.\\nWife Erin Alvey describes fear of watching Forsberg\\'s injuries\\nAlvey has moments of vulnerable honesty in the episode, especially when describing the dangers Forsberg faces in playing hockey.\\nWhen talking about Forsberg\\'s concussion he suffered on Feb. 11, 2023, Alvey was nearly moved to tears in recalling the moment.\\n\"Last year was it\\'s own nightmare,\" Alvey said.\\nForsberg suffered a concussion that kept him out of the lineup the remainder of the 2022-23 season. The recovery process was lengthy, but the rest allowed him to play all 82 games in the 2023-24 season.\\nAlvey also recalled the moment Forsberg fought Detroit\\'s Moritz Seider. Though it was only Forsberg\\'s third NHL fight, she said watching her husband fight on the ice was terrifying.\\n\"No more fights,\" Alvey said.\\nAlvey\\'s devotion to Forsberg is apparent throughout the episode. She articulates well the worrying nature of being married to a professional athlete, but she\\'s also huge fan of her husband\\'s sport. She even has an air freshener of Forsberg\\'s mustachioed face hanging from the mirror of her car.\\nBirth of Felix Forsberg comes nine days after Game 6 loss\\nOn May 12 − shortly after the Predators lost Game 6 to the Vancouver Canucks − Forsberg\\'s son was born.\\n\"That\\'s the only silver lining of losing in the playoffs,\" Forsberg said. \"Six, seven days later, Felix came and I\\'ve been home every single day of it.\"\\nThough the couple had plans in place if Forsberg was still playing when the baby arrived, Alvey admitted it was a relief that her husband was home during the birth.\\n\"Looking back, I don\\'t know what I would have done if you weren\\'t here,\" Alvey said to Forsberg as he held their newborn.\\nForsberg also added that it\\'s possible the couple plans to add more children to their family.\\n\"We would love to have more in the future when the time is right, but you can\\'t take that for granted either.\"',\n",

       "   'summary': 'ASHEVILLE, N.C. — If she had known the rivers would swallow whole towns and neighbors would be swept away, Lindsey Miller would have better prepared – or left her home altogether.\\nHer home near Boone, North Carolina, survived but there was no power, cell service or water. Some neighbors filled buckets from a nearby river to flush toilets and washed children with bottled water.\\nMiller recalled hearing the ping of emergency phone warnings early on the morning of Sept. 27, just hours before the water rushed in. By then it was too late.\\n\\'We knew there was a storm coming, but we didn\\'t know it was going to be quite like that,\\' she said. \\'We really weren\\'t prepared at all.\\'\\nRescue teams continued to comb rivers and towns for victims or survivors of the massive floods that pounded western North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Georgia. The death toll as of Thursday afternoon was at 200 across the Southeast and expected to climb. In Buncombe County, the epicenter of the devastation that includes Asheville, officials so far have counted at least 72 dead.\\nAuthorities also will begin the process of studying the alert system that warned residents of the incoming floods, triggered by remnants of Hurricane Helene, and how the system could improve.\\nInterviews with residents, experts, meteorologists and local officials paint a picture of a storm rapidly intensifying, barrelling farther inland than usual and stunning many residents and officials with its ferocity.\\nThe historic disaster also presented unique challenges to emergency officials trying to evacuate and safeguard residents in a mountainous region assailed by multiple floods and tropical-storm winds.\\nResidents from Tennessee to North Carolina complained they weren\\'t given enough warning – or any warning at all – of the floodwaters that overtook their homes and the dams nearing their breaking points.\\n\\'There was no warning,\\' said Sunday Greer, a high school counselor at Sullivan East High School in Bluff City, Tennessee. \\'Basically, we did not receive anything officially.\\'\\nThe emergency planning and response to the floods, from forecasts to evacuations, will be studied in the weeks and months ahead, said Russ Strickland, Maryland\\'s emergency management director and president of the National Emergency Management Association.\\n\\'This one came with greater strength than they anticipated,\\' he said. \\'Before it\\'s all over, there will be some very serious conversations with NOAA, the forecast office of NHC, state officials. Did they miss something? Was there an indication?\\'\\nDire early warnings\\nAs Helene gathered strength in the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, Buncombe County officials began taking phone calls from meteorologists as they tracked the storm\\'s path and intensity.\\nHelene was several days away from making landfall near Florida\\'s Big Bend. But a cold front had recently swept through western North Carolina, unleashing storms and dumping more than six inches of rain in the mountainous region, swelling streams and saturating the ground. Helene was a large, strong, fast-moving storm – heading right at them and promising to dump more water.\\nThe situation looked so dire that by Wednesday, Sept. 26, Buncombe County officials declared a local state of emergency for low-lying areas, such as Asheville and Montreat, the county\\'s director of communication, Lillian Govus, told USA TODAY.\\nLater that day, they stood up an Emergency Operations Center in the county emergency services building just north of Asheville. County manager Avril Pinder, Assistant Emergency Services Director Ryan Cole and law enforcement and fire officials, among others, gathered to digest the data and forecasts and decide what to do with all of it.\\n\\'CATASTROPHIC FLASH FLOODING POSSIBLE,\\' warned a post on the Buncombe County Facebook site that day, repeating the warning in Spanish for its nearly 22,000 Latino residents.\\nNo evacuations were ordered.\\n\\'This is really about to get bad\\'\\nAround the same time, Clay Chaney, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service\\'s Weather Forecast Office in Greer, South Carolina, settled into his workspace and began tracking Helene\\'s activity in the Gulf. Responsible for upstate South Carolina, western North Carolina and parts of Georgia, Chaney sensed mountain flooding would be the biggest threat to his region.\\nHe was all too aware of the thunderstorms raking the region. Known as \\'predecessor events,\\' the storm created dangerous conditions for Helene\\'s path. A hydrologist in his office mulled over river gauge readings and other data to forecast flood threats.\\nBy Tuesday, Sept. 24, Chaney and others began holding daily webinars, hour-long virtual chats with local and state emergency management officials in his region, including Buncombe County. At 3:30 p.m., more than 230 people dialed in, as Chaney talked through a series of slides showing Helene\\'s path, wind speed and the potential of severe flooding as it reached the Appalachian range.\\nLow-lying areas needed to be ready for \\'worst-case scenarios,\\' he told those on the call. Chaney patiently answered questions as the webinar stretched to nearly an hour.\\nThe next morning, Wednesday, Sept. 25, Chaney reached his office and his heart leapt – the rainfall totals from the earlier thunderstorms were as high as feared, up to 9 inches in some places. Fresh rains could create historic floods, he and others predicted. That day, rain from Helene\\'s outer bands began dropping in the region.\\n\\'We were like, \\'Oh crap, this is really about to get bad,\\' he said.\\nRivers rise to historic highs\\nAt the Sept. 25 webinar with emergency officials, Chaney stepped up the rhetoric, comparing the upcoming floods to those of the \\'Great Flood of 1916,\\' a deluge that overran towns, killed at least 80 people in Buncombe County and destroyed homes, factories and railroads.\\nHis office also released posts on social media sites with dire predictions.\\n\\'*URGENT MESSAGE*,\\' it began. \\'This will be one of the most significant weather events to happen in the western portions of the area in the modern era. Record flooding is forecasted and has been compared to the floods of 1916 in the Asheville area.\\'\\nThe post added: \\'We cannot stress the significance of this event enough. Heed all evacuation orders from your local Emergency Managers …\\'\\nThroughout the region, river gauges were heralding unprecedented rises and forecasting historic highs. The gauge at French Broad River at Asheville showed the river rise more than 2 feet an hour, from 2.31 feet at 3 p.m. Wednesday to 10.19 feet at 9 a.m. Thursday.\\n\\'By Thursday, we\\'re pretty much forecasting the worst-case scenario,\\' Chaney said, \\'and letting our partners know about it.\\'\\nNot everyone was tuned in to the impending storm. Denia Zuniga, 44, a native of San Pedro Sula, Honduras, living about 10 miles east of Asheville in Swannanoa, had worked back-to-back shifts cleaning homes and had not been following the news.\\nAs she left work late Thursday, a co-worker told her a hurricane was coming, but didn\\'t say where. She didn\\'t think much of it.\\nThat night, it rained but otherwise nothing seemed out of the ordinary. She fed her kids, Estefany, 10, and Anthony, 18, and went to sleep with husband, Pedro Rivera Hernandez, 43, also from Honduras.\\nHer smartphone never rang with alerts.\\n\\'Take action now\\'\\nIn Buncombe County, officials were heeding forecasters\\' warnings.\\nAt 4 p.m. Thursday, officials from Buncombe and Henderson counties, as well as the North Carolina Highway Patrol, held a virtual news conference over Zoom, broadcast over several official social media sites, to warn residents of the forecast of \\'catastrophic\\' and \\'historic\\' flooding and suggested, for the first time, that residents in flood-prone areas should evacuate.\\nPinder, the county manager, warned an estimated 15,000 homes in flood-prone areas could be impacted by flooding.\\n\\'We cannot stress enough the seriousness of this situation,\\' she said. \\'If you live in a flood prone area … you should take action now – right now.\\'\\nAs Helene\\'s outer bands strummed into western North Carolina late Thursday and early Friday, dumping rain over the region, rivers swelled, quickly overflowing in some areas. At about 4 a.m., lights started to flick off across the county, as power outages swept the region.\\nEmergency personnel reported rivers in Buncombe County overtaking their banks and rushing down roads.\\n\\'Niagara Falls for five hours straight\\'\\nAt 5:30 a.m. Friday, Sept. 27, Chaney dispatched an urgent warning to Buncombe County: \\'FLASH FLOOD EMERGENCY FOR SWANNANOA RIVER VALLEY BELOW NORTH FORK RESERVOIR …\\'\\nThe message buzzed cell phones throughout the county as Wireless Emergency Alerts, the same alerts that warn residents of incoming tornados.\\nForty-five minutes later, at 6:15 a.m., Buncombe County issued its own emergency warning: a mandatory evacuation order that beeped into phones via the Integrated Public Alert & Warning System, or IPAWS, FEMA\\'s system for local emergencies. The county didn\\'t need approval from the state to order the mandatory evacuation, Govus said.\\nBut at that point, it was too late to get out, Chaney said.\\n\\'By the time you get a flash flood emergency, it\\'s way too late to evacuate,\\' he said. \\'At that point, your only option is to go to higher ground.\\'\\nZuniga woke up early Friday morning as winds pounded the walls of her home. She peeked outside and saw a thin layer of water covering the yard and street outside. She shook her husband awake and checked her phone: No signal.\\nBy the time she threw on clothes and stepped outside to warn a neighbor, the water had risen nearly to her knees, she said. Everywhere she looked, water rushed around her. It was time to go, she thought.\\nShe grabbed her kids and their passports and Hernandez drove them off in his truck. Within a few hours, floodwaters had completely swallowed their home. The water rushed up so fast that many of her neighbors were trapped in their homes and had to be rescued, Zuniga said.\\n\"We lost everything,\" she said later at a shelter where she and her family retreated to in nearby Fletcher. \"Everything we owned was in that house.\"\\nShe wished she\\'d had an earlier warning.\\n\"We would\\'ve evacuated,\" Zuniga said. \"Knowing what was coming, we would\\'ve left.\"\\nAll that Friday, walls of muddied water rushed down roads and highways, tossing houses off foundations, mauling bridges and sweeping residents into the torrent.\\nBy afternoon, the French Broad River at Asheville had crested at 24.67 feet, breaking its record from the 1916 flood by more than a foot, according to NOAA. Another French Broad River gauge at Fletcher, marked its crest at 30.31 feet – more than 10 feet higher than its record crest in 2004.\\nGovus said they relied on river readings to decide when to evacuate. But the sheer scope and destructive force of the floods took everyone by surprise.\\n\\'It was like being hit by Niagara Falls for five hours straight,\\' she said.\\n\\'Nowhere to get out of the way\\'\\nAs other communities dug themselves out of the flood\\'s rubble, other residents and officials complained they weren\\'t given enough warning.\\nIn East Tennessee, dams owned and operated by the Tennessee Valley Authority, the nation\\'s largest public power provider, provided a critical mechanism for slowing the flow of Helene\\'s historic floodwaters as they tore down mountains across the state line.\\nFlooding upstream of the dams was devastating in some places, prompting a dramatic airlift evacuation of 62 people from a hospital rooftop in Unicoi County. The Nolichucky River, which turned the hospital into an island, flowed with nearly twice the volume of Niagara Falls over a small TVA dam downstream.\\nEleven flooding deaths were confirmed in Tennessee by Oct. 2, and officials expected the number to grow.\\nBy the time the first flash flood emergency warnings buzzed into Kriston Hicks\\' phone at 9:20 a.m. on Friday, Sept. 27, the water already had muscled into her home in Hampton, Tennessee, that she shared with her 78-year-old grandfather and six dogs.\\nDeciding to evacuate, she waded through water to retrieve her grandfather and carry him to her van.\\n\\'No one came to tell me,\" Hicks said. \"There is no siren in Hampton.\"\\nThough her home was destroyed by the flood and torn down on Wednesday, Hicks was reunited with four dogs.\\nOther residents received the alerts – but didn\\'t heed them. In Erwin, Tennessee, Zully Manzanares saw the warnings that began the night of Sept. 26, but didn\\'t grasp the scope of the disaster headed her way.\\n\\'We\\'ve gotten them before,\" she said.\\nBut she never thought the warnings would lead to the devastation she saw.\\nManzanares, a Head Start program coordinator and bilingual Spanish speaker, helps immigrants in Erwin\\'s Hispanic neighborhoods. At least three members of the community who worked at the Impact Plastics on the Nolichucky River have been confirmed dead or missing.\\nThe Tennessee Bureau of Investigation has opened an investigation into the incident, including allegations that employees were told to stay at work during the floods. The company has denied the allegations.\\nThe flooding continued beyond the dams, too. Some downstream residents, like Greer, the Bluff City high school counselor, said they were not warned of continued flooding as the utility released record amounts of water through spill gates.\\n\\'They\\'re … saying they\\'ve got to prepare for the next storm,\\' Greer said. \\'They didn\\'t prepare for the first storm.\\'\\nOn Thursday, Sept. 26, the day before the floods, Watauga County, North Carolina, officially declared a state of emergency. County officials sent out wireless alert warnings via cell phones, but with cell phone service down, many of those alerts never reached phones, said William Holt, the county\\'s emergency services director.\\nAs Helene approached and conditions deteriorated, Holt said emergency officials struggled with where residents could be safely evacuated – if there was such a route. An initial city shelter flooded and had to be moved, he said. Two people in the area died in landslides.\\n\\'The last thing we would want to do is to move someone from one area to another just to put them in harm\\'s way,\\' he said, and added: \\'There was nowhere to get out of the way in this type of event.\\'',\n",

       "   'summary': 'When all modern conveniences are washed away, the reliable mule remains steadfast.\\nLast week, Hurricane Helene unleashed its fury upon the southern Appalachians after making landfall as a Category 4 storm in Florida\\'s Big Bend—the most powerful storm on record for the region. With at least 222 confirmed deaths, it now ranks as the fourth-deadliest hurricane in U.S. history.\\nNorth Carolina bore the brunt of the storm\\'s impact, where catastrophic flooding — described by some as a \"biblical\" disaster — triggered massive landslides, burying roads and submerging entire mountain towns.\\nOnce-familiar trails have transformed into treacherous landscapes, buried under a chaotic jumble of fallen trees, thick brush, and jagged debris. Where vehicles can\\'t go, mules navigate narrow paths, their hooves steady as they maneuver through the storm-ravaged terrain to deliver essential supplies to remote areas.\\n\"They have had many roles in their careers, from hauling camping gear and fresh hunt, pulling wagons and farm equipment; to serving in training the best of the very best of our military special forces, carrying weapons, medical supplies, and even wounded soldiers,\" Mountain Mule Packers Ranch wrote on Facebook.\\nLeading the way: Mules in the aftermath of Helene\\nAs Appalachian communities confront devastation, the mule stands out as an unsung hero. With each determined step, these resilient animals symbolize hope as they navigate through rubble to assist those in need.\\nSince the historic storm swept through the southeastern United States, a train of mules and their riders has trekked through the chaos from dawn to dusk, delivering essential supplies to people in hard-to-reach areas. As power and cellular outages persist, these riders risk their own safety, skillfully maneuvering their mules along treacherous trails.\\nA video posted by Mountain Mule Packers Ranch captures the devastating scene in Swannanoa, where the landscape lies in ruins, rendering it impassable for vehicles.\\n\"Heavy equipment will definitely get this cleared, but in the meantime, mules can carry gear through here quickly!\" the organization noted.\\nFrom cleaning supplies and canned foods to hygiene products, blankets, clothing — and even a teddy bear with a note of support from a young donor — the mules have tirelessly carried load after load, shouldering the burdens that the people of Appalachia can no longer bear.\\n\"We were not out of the trucks for two minutes before we had people coming to us that needed dog food,\" the organization shared online Wednesday.\\nEarlier this week, they shared a video of their work with Cajun Navy 2016, highlighting their mission to deliver ice to an elderly man at the top of Appalachian Way for his insulin. As the man in need walked down the steps of his home toward the mules, he smiled, and a woman exclaimed, \"Look at that!\"\\nAs the video continues, the man commends their efforts, noting that they are providing assistance \"in the rain,\" while one of the riders grins, nods and repeats, \"in the rain!\"\\n\"You know what though?\" another rider behind the camera said. \"We got that ice for you!\"\\n\"How many days do we take for granted the simple things?\" the organization reflected in their post. \"In times like these, we recognize how much we are blessed with! We are so grateful the mules have helped deliver essential items to those in need.\"',\n",

That $250,000 will be paid by Arkansas to Tennessee, per the SEC\\'s policy, as the Vols were the opposing institution.\\nThe 6-foot-4 defensive lineman is in his fifth season with the Vols and is coming off his best year with career-high numbers in total tackles (35) and tackles for a loss (4.5). Through the first five games of the season, Thomas has recorded six total tackles, two broken-up passes and 1.5 tackles for a loss of 2 yards.\\nAs a result of their loss Saturday, the Vols moved down to No. 9 in the US LBM Coaches Poll and No. 8 in the AP Top 25 poll, both of which were released Sunday.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden raised concerns that the 2024 election won\\'t be peaceful during a rare visit Friday to the White House press briefing room, saying he worries what former President Donald Trump might do if he loses.\\n\"I\\'m confident it will be fair. I don\\'t know whether it will be peaceful,\" Biden told reporters, making his first appearance at the White House press briefing room over his nearly four years as president.\\nTrump, the 2024 Republican nominee, tried to overturn his 2020 election loss to Biden by making repeated baseless claims of election fraud, an effort that culminated with a mob of supporters attacking the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Trump faces federal criminal charges tied to his efforts but has pleaded not guilty.\\nAhead of the November 5 election, Trump has made similar unsubstantiated claims of a \"rigged\" election as he faces off against Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee.\\n\\'The things that Trump has said and the things that he said last time out when he didn\\'t like the outcome of the election were very dangerous,\" Biden said.\\nBiden was responding to a question from a reporter about whether he\\'s confident the 2024 election will be free, fair and peaceful.\\nTrump\\'s running-mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, refused to acknowledge that Trump lost the 2020 election when asked directly about it by Harris running-mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz during the CBS News Vice Presidential debate earlier this week.\\n\\'I noticed that the vice-presidential Republican candidate did not say he\\'d accept the outcome of the election and hasn\\'t even accepted the outcome of the last election,\\' Biden said on Friday. \\'I\\'m concerned about what they\\'re going to do.\\'\\nBiden used his unannounced appearance at the White House press briefing to tout the September jobs report, which showed 254,000 new jobs added last month, and a recent agreement between port companies and dock workers that ended a strike with major economic ramifications. He pushed back at skeptics who have criticized his economic record.\\n\"The simple fact is we\\'ve gone from an economy in crisis to literally having the strongest economy in the world,\" Biden said. \"But we have more work to do.\"\\nPast presidents Trump, Barack Obama and George W. Bush frequently took questions in the White House press briefing room. But the 81-year-old Biden, who ended his reelection bid last July amid concerns about his age, has opened himself up to questions from reporters far less frequently than his predecessors.\\nAsked why Biden never came to the briefing room over the previous three and a half years, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre responded, \"He came today.\"',\n",

Many of the patients were critically ill and moaning in pain from broken bones, head gashes and other injuries blamed on Tropical Storm Helene.\\nAbout 300 patients poured in during a six-hour period, some with make-shift bandages and slings. One person had caution tape wrapped around an injury as a tourniquet, said Matt Riester, a TeamHealth physician who oversees the emergency department at the hospital.\\n\"Obviously, it was very loud and seemed very chaotic,\" Riester said.\\nThe afternoon flooding on Sept. 27, Riester fought to make his way to work. He maneuvered around downed power lines and bumped over tree limbs, with his usual 30-minute commute taking two hours. He saw the surging French Broad River, typically 20 feet below the bridge, nearly level with the road.\\n\"It was a very difficult and terrifying experience going over a bridge and you\\'re not sure if it\\'s going to get washed away,\" he said.\\nWhen he walked into the emergency room, it was a hectic sight.\\nNurses used a whiteboard to triage patients, placing them in beds side-by-side in pods of 12 so doctors could quickly move from one to the other. Not everyone made it, though an exact count of those who died at the hospital has not been released.\\nThe Asheville medical center is one of six hospitals owned by Nashville-based HCA Healthcare in the hard-hit Western North Carolina region impacted by the storm.\\nHCA set up mobile units with kitchens, bathrooms and handwashing stations and mini marts inside the medical centers to provide doctors, nurses and other hospital staff with free groceries, including food, water and toiletries.\\nThe hospital system also provided hundreds of thousands of bottles of water, tens of thousands of gallons of fuel and satellite data networks to Mission Hospital. The hospital, perched atop a hill just south of downtown Asheville, dodged flooding that submerged much of Buncombe County.\\nMany employees remained at the hospital in the storm\\'s aftermath despite being concerned about the well-being of loved ones, sleeping on cots or air mattresses, said Mission Hospital CEO Greg Lowe.\\nAt least 72 victims have been reported in Ashville and Buncombe County as of Friday morning, but more than 200 remain missing. The Asheville hospital set three mobile morgues to be ready for more body recoveries.\\n\"We\\'re preparing for what\\'s next,\" Lowe said.\\nThe Asheville area fatalities are part of the Southeast death toll blamed on Helene that surpassed 200 on Thursday, according to a USA TODAY analysis.\\nMore than 1,000 hospital workers have been sleeping at the hospital since the flooding, Kody Kinsley, secretary of the state\\'s Department of Health and Human Services, said during the news conference Monday.\\n\"We went to Mission Hospital to see firsthand the heroic efforts of the individuals of that hospital,\" he said.\\nThe health department is working with insurers to identify residents who rely on oxygen and other medical supplies and proactively offer to have emergency management make deliveries. The health department also has activated the patient transfer system, sending patients who can\\'t get immediate care in impacted areas to other medical centers across the state.\\nHCA donated $1 million to relief efforts. And, since many of the medical professionals also are flooding victims, the hospital system also set up HCA Healthcare Hope Fund, an employee-run, employee-supported charity that provides financial aid and resources after an extended illness, injury or disaster.',\n",

Does he even have that desire?\\nDeion Sanders' recruiting class ranks last in the Big 12. Is that evidence that he'll permanently live in the portal, or a sign that he's got one foot out the door.\\nOle Miss football schedule not as much of an issue as its offensive line.\\nDeion Sanders ' luggage sure looks swanky.\\nLouis Vuitton, he called it, and it comes with a nice set of wheels.\\nThe stars whom Sanders packed up and brought with him from Jackson State to Colorado proved they can excel anywhere. Travis Hunter and Shedeur Sanders helped Coach Prime answer the question of whether he can win at this level.\\nHe can, and he has.\\n'I'm so excited,' Sanders said Saturday after his team's 48-21 victory over Central Florida that put Colorado in a tie atop the Big 12 standings. 'You have no idea.'\\nSo, here's the next question now that we know Sanders passes muster.\\nCan he sustain success at Colorado? Does he even have that desire?\\nSanders operates as if he plans to live out of his suitcase rather than unpack and set down roots.\\nYes, I know he said he plans to coach Colorado for at least 10 seasons and that he doesn't desire an NFL job. He also once said God called him to coach Jackson State, and he pledged on '60 Minutes' to 'change the perspective of HBCU football.' He did that, briefly, until someone else called. Colorado was on the line. He gathered his luggage and jetted off.\\nAnd I don't blame Sanders a bit for accepting a better job and a bigger paycheck, but there's what you say, and there's what you do.\\nAnd Sanders' actions make him a flight risk.\\nCheck out Colorado's recruiting class. It ranks dead last in the Big 12 in the 247Sports Composite. Only eight prospects are committed to the class. He's recruiting (or not recruiting, rather) like a guy who plans to vamoose.\\nBecause, Sanders has plenty to sell, if he had the appetite for recruiting. He's 8-9 at Colorado, including 4-1 this season.\\nIf you don't think that's applaudable, you've forgotten the rubbish bin this program lived in before Sanders' arrival. Colorado joined Northwestern as the nation's worst Bowl Subdivisions programs in 2022. Colorado hired Sanders to spice things up. Has he ever.\\nWhich makes Colorado's stalled recruiting all the more noteworthy. Sanders shouldn't struggle selling his vision to high school prospects.\\nSanders lived out of the transfer portal the past two years. His strategy fared better than many expected it would.\\nA star quarterback like Shedeur who can pass and run remains a great equalizer. He puts a spiffy coat of varnish on this team.\\nAnd, to Prime's credit, he improved the defense.\\nBut, how long can he sustain this?\\nShedeur Sanders and Hunter will head to the NFL after this season. Transfers of their ability are more the exception than the rule. Shilo Sanders, another of Prime's sons, is a sixth-year senior safety. What's stopping Prime from following his sons out the door?\\nThe portal provides valuable tire patches for a program stranded on the shoulder, and coaches who ignore transfers live foolishly. But, building a program almost exclusively out of the portal becomes a highwire act. You can't miss a step.\\nSigning and developing elite linemen remains the engine behind championship programs. Prime knows this. If there's one thing he isn't, it's dumb.\\nI don't think it's that Sanders can't recruit. Mostly, I think he just doesn't want to, because why recruit to a place where you don't plan to be?\\nIf Sanders hears another calling after this season, Colorado will have received the full Prime experience.\\nSanders magnetized eyeballs to a program that starved for attention. His presence helped ensure Colorado didn't get left behind in realignment. And it's no coincidence Colorado's admissions applications surged after his first season. He put the university in the spotlight, and he made Colorado football fun, and college students like having fun.\\nAnd when he packs his luggage and listens for a voice from on high, Colorado would do well to go hire the next Sanders, except that won't be impossible, because Coach Prime can't be duplicated.\\nHere's what else is brewing in this 'Topp Rope' view of college football:\\nDid Ole Miss get foiled by cupcake schedule?\\nIt's easy to rip Mississippi's soft schedule throughout the first four weeks and use that to explain the Rebels' 20-17 upset loss to Kentucky, but that cupcake feast didn't cause this loss.\\nOhio State opened the season with a few joke foes before crushing Michigan State in its first conference game.\\nThe Rebels opening the season against Furman did not form their chief issue. Rather, Lane Kiffin's 'Portal King' strategy fell short in offensive line development.\\nKentucky pushed around Ole Miss. If the Rebels had faced tougher opponents earlier in the season, they might have two losses by now, not one.\\nEmails of the week\\nGary writes: You hit it right the other day when you said Hugh Freeze was no longer a QB whisperer. In the Oklahoma game, he should have yelled to Payton Thorne, run the ball, and we'll punt. Thorne never should have thrown the ball for the pick-six, but there's where coaching comes into play. You, as a coach, take charge, and run the ball.\\nMy response: Agreed. Auburn should've run the ball.\\nHere's the scenario you referenced: Auburn led 21-16 with less than five minutes remaining and faced third-and-4 from Oklahoma's 43-yard line. Call a run play, and one of three things happen. You gain a first down, you set up fourth-and-short and go for it, or you get stuffed and punt on fourth-and-medium to pin Oklahoma deep. The one thing that wouldn't happen: A turnover-prone quarterback throws a pick-six.\\nBut, hey, Freeze says he dialed up one of his best game plans ever in that loss. Phew. If that's Freeze's best game plan, then Auburn needs a new coach.\\nBurt writes: Did we watch the same game? Alabama roared to a large halftime lead. Georgia fought back and took the lead late in the game as the Alabama offense completely shut down. Alabama was lucky to hit on a deep ball to win the game. The Alabama quarterback was completely ineffective in the second half except for one play.\\nMy response: We watched the same game, but you must have missed Jalen Milroe torching Georgia for 491 total yards. If Milroe hadn't been so 'ineffective,' as you say, he might have gone for 800 yards.\\nThree and out\\n1. If Missouri wins Saturday at Texas A&M, I'll take the Tigers seriously as a playoff contender, while Google searches spike for Eliah Drinkwitz in Gainesville, Florida. He's 15-2 the past two seasons at Missouri, and he even wears a visor like Steve Spurrier.\\n2. I can hear it now: Come early December, if Georgia is 9-3 with losses to Alabama, Texas and Tennessee, SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey will quote 'Sesame Street' again.\\n3. If you're wondering why Chip Kelly left his UCLA coaching gig to become Ohio State's offensive coordinator, he recently offered this whiff of insight into the perks of being an assistant: 'You can go to the bathroom between series if you have to.' For further explanation, see UCLA's 1-3 record this season. Kelly stepped down the ladder in exchange for leaving a program that's in the toilet.\\nThe k.\",\n",

Other than that, the flight was nominal,\" Bruno said during the ULA launch webcast.\\nCrews initially scheduled liftoff for 6 a.m., pushed the target time back to 6:30, and rescheduled the launch within a few minutes of Cape Canaveral\\'s 7:16 a.m. sunrise.\\n\"It was a beautiful liftoff this morning. I think we\\'re all really excited to see that. It\\'s such a significant launch, in terms of our certification and where we\\'re going with Vulcan. So it was just a tremendous accomplishment from this team,\" Megan LePien, ULA\\'s Space Force program manager, said during the launch webcast.\\nWith a successful launch Bruno said ULA has a pair of national security missions \"in the pipeline,\" after which the company will roll into next year. During a Wednesday media roundtable, he said ULA will launch as many as 20 missions next year, split roughly between Vulcan and Atlas V rockets.\\nRick Neale contributed to this story.',\n",

       "   'excerpt': \"Here's where top Republican Party figures stand on gun policy\",\n",
       "   'summary': \"The Republican Party's 2024 platform makes little mention of gun rights or the Second Amendment beyond saying that the party would protect 'THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS.' Despite that, the issue remains central to the upcoming elections, and many Republican politicians continue to campaign heavily on it.\\nGun violence and gun safety were essential talking points in Tuesday's vice-presidential debate between Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota and Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance.\\nAsked about what he would do to curb gun deaths among children and teens, Vance, who the moderators noted opposes red flag laws and semi-automatic rifle bans, answered that schools should be hardened as targets for mass shootings.\\n'We have to increase security in our schools. We have to make the doors lock better. We have to make the doors stronger. We've got to make the windows stronger,' he said. 'And of course, we've got to increase school resource officers because the idea that we can magically wave a wand and take guns out of the hands of bad guys, it just doesn't fit with recent experience.'\\nOn the issue of whether parents should be held responsible for contributing to a shooting by their children, he said, 'I certainly trust local law enforcement and local authorities to make those decisions.'\\nRepublican voters seem to share the opinions of their elected officials. A 2024 poll from the Pew Research Center found that 40% of supporters of former President Donald Trump said that 'An increase in the number of guns in the United States is good for society,' and 86% said that 'Gun ownership does more to increase safety by allowing law-abiding citizens to protect themselves' than 'Reduce safety by giving too many people access to firearms and increasing misuse.'\\nThe poll also found that 27% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents said that gun violence 'is a very big problem,' compared to 68% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning independent voters.\\nAt the Gun Owners Advocacy and Leadership Summit in Knoxville in August, Trump underlined the centrality of opposition to firearm regulations to the party's base, The Trace reported. He falsely claimed that Vice President Kamala Harris, who is a gun owner along with Walz, was a 'gun grabber.'\\nPresident Biden signed a bipartisan gun safety bill into law in 2022, which encouraged states to pass red flag laws, banned convicted domestic abusers from owning guns, and expanded background checks for those under 21.\\nConservative support of gun rights extends beyond elected officials. The U.S. Supreme Court, with a conservative majority cemented by former President Donald Trump's appointments, struck down a concealed carry restriction in New York in 2023 and overturned a ban on bump stocks earlier this year.\\nThe issue of gun rights is 'something that's very important to us, from a campaign standpoint and an issue standpoint,' Trump campaign co-manager and Republican strategist Chris LaCivita said at an event sponsored by the U.S. Concealed Carry Association at the Republican National Convention in July, according to reporting from Salon. LaCivita said that strengthening a conservative majority in the judiciary, which is favorable to weakening gun safety laws, was his goal.\\n'Allowing law-abiding citizens to carry their firearms and to protect themselves and to protect their families… that's an issue that will always be an important one for the Republican Party.'\",\n",

       "   'summary': 'A court filing unsealed Wednesday reveals new details in the allegations against Donald Trump in his federal election subversion case.\\nThe revelatory filing by Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith attempts to prove to the court that Trump was acting as a private citizen in his alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election, a crucial distinction following the Supreme Court\\'s presidential immunity ruling.\\nWhile there is unlikely to be any hearings or trials in this case ahead of the Nov. 5 election, the 165-page filing is a detailed outline of what Smith\\'s team has gathered to make the case that Trump conspired to overturn the election and obstructed Congress on Jan. 6, 2021.\\nTrump has pleaded not guilty, and his lawyers called the filing a \\'monstrosity\" and a \\'false hit piece.\"\\nHere is what to know about the filing, the case and Trump\\'s other legal charges:\\nTrump said \\'so what\\' to Pence being evacuated from Capitol, filing says\\nAccording to the filing, Trump allegedly disregarded concerns over former Vice President Mike Pence\\'s safety during the Capitol attack.\\nApproximately 90 minutes after Pence publicly refused to overturn the election results and as rioters breached the Capitol, Trump criticized Pence on social media while sitting alone watching the news, the court filing claims. The Secret Service had to move Pence to a secure location shortly after.\\n\"Upon receiving a phone call alerting him that Pence had been taken to a secure location, (redacted) rushed to the dining room to inform the defendant in hopes that the defendant would take action to ensure Pence\\'s safety,\" Smith writes. \"Instead, after (redacted) delivered the news, the defendant looked at him and said only, \\'So what?\\'\"\\nRioters at the Capitol that afternoon chanted \"Hang Mike Pence!\" \"Where is Pence? Bring him out!\" and \"Traitor Pence!\" the filing states.\\nTrump planned to declare himself the winner on election night, prosecutors state\\nThe filing alleges Trump laid the groundwork for his election conspiracies ahead of Election Day in 2020.\\nEvidence gathered by prosecutors indicated that campaign advisors told Trump ahead of the election the results could be misleading on election nights because later-counted mail-in ballots were likely to favor President Joe Biden.\\n\"Privately, the defendant told advisors...that in such a scenario, he would simply declare victory before all the ballots were counted and any winner was projected,\" the filing states. \"Publicly, the defendant began to plant the seeds for that false declaration.\"\\nIn the early hours of the morning following election night, Trump did claim victory and baselessly claimed election fraud, records show.\\nSmith\\'s team also argues his allies fomented chaos in this uncertain time between Election Day and the race results. They named one example of a campaign employee and alleged co-conspirator in Michigan, who responded to warnings of unrest with \"make them riot\" and \"Do it!!!\"\\nWhat are the charges against Trump?\\nTrump faces four charges of conspiring to overturn the election and obstructing Congress in counting Electoral College votes on Jan. 6, 2021. He has pleaded not guilty.\\nThe Supreme Court ruled July 1 that former presidents are shielded from charges for conduct at the core of their office, such as pardons and vetoes, and are presumptively immune to charges for other official duties. But former presidents are not immune for private conduct, which prosecutors contend Trump was doing in electioneering to stay in office.\\nSmith alleged Trump\\'s \"increasingly desperate\" criminal conduct included lying to state officials in seven states, to induce them to ignore true vote counts; manufacturing fraudulent electoral votes in targeted states; trying to enlist Pence to obstruct the certification of the election on Jan. 6, 2021; and directing an angry mob to the Capitol that day.\\nWhat is happening in Trump\\'s other criminal cases?\\nNew York hush money case: Trump was convicted for 34 counts of falsifying business records in May 2024. The sentencing is scheduled for Nov. 26.\\nGeorgia election racketeering case: Trump and 14 other defendants remain in the case that accuses them of trying to steal the election in the state. The case is on hold while an appellate court decides on the defendants\\' motion to disqualify Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis on allegations of misconduct and conflict of interest.\\nFederal classified documents case: U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed the case that charges Trump with taking hundreds of classified documents and hoarding them. She argued special counsel Smith should have been confirmed by the Senate or Congress, a decision he is trying to appeal. Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, has made a number of unusual decisions in the case that have been favorable to Trump.',\n",

       "   'summary': \"The Tennessee high school football season enters Week 7 with a heavy dose of games that will be played on Thursday. But one of the marquee matches in the Nashville area will take play at 7 p.m. Friday when Franklin travels to Brentwood in a Region 6-6A game.\\nThe two Williamson County rivals have played 46 times since 1985 and Brentwood (5-1, 2-0) has won eight straight against the Admirals (4-2, 2-0). Franklin hasn't enjoyed a dominant period against Brentwood since it won 10 of 12 games from 1985 to 1996.\\nThe answer?\\nAfter a tumultuous three seasons, that included a winless 2022, Franklin has put the past behind it with new coach Josh Adkins. The Admirals are enjoying their best season since 2020, when they finished 7-6 and made the Class 6A quarterfinals. Adkins has unlocked an offense that struggled to remain consistent last season, despite showing flashes of explosiveness.\\nGiving credit where credit is due\\nWhile offensive numbers always take center stage, Brentwood has been fueled by its defense, particularly in the past three games. The Bruins haven't given up more than six points in those games and only 12 combined. Even in its one loss, Brentwood gave up only 16 points to Brentwood Academy in Week 2. Linebacker William Stockhoff leads an impressive group with 64 tackles, averaging 10 a game. Nine other Brentwood players have 25 or more tackles this season.\\nThree Franklin players who matter\\nQB Brewer Wilson: Wilson's dominant performance against Summit last week led to 258 yards passing and five touchdowns.\\nWR Sean Gaca: While Wilson was putting the ball in the air, Gaca was among the wideouts who benefited. He had five catches for 65 yards and a TD in last week's 38-7 win.\\nWR Lucas Young: Young was the most productive of Wilson's targets with four receptions for 120 yards and a TD.\\nThree Brentwood players who matter\\nQB Canon Kinder: Kinder has been solid as Brentwood's starting quarterback. He had 96 yards passing and two TDs in a 42-6 win over Overton.\\nQB J.C. White: White shares the quarterback duties with Kinder. He added 68 yards passing and a TD last week.\\nWR Clayton Merrill: An Austin Peay commitment, Merrill caught six passes for 79 yards.\\nFranklin's remaining TSSAA football schedule\\nOct. 18: at Ravenwood\\nOct. 25: at Mt.

       "   'excerpt': 'Rev. William Barber II called for the presidential campaign to focus on the poor, the truth in a post VP-debate interview.',\n",
       "   'summary': 'As the nation reviewed the vice presidential debate between Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz Tuesday night, Rev. William J. Barber II noticed one group of people missing from the conversation: the poor.\\nThe founder of Repairers of the Breach, The Poor People\\'s Campaign and the Director of the Center for Public Theology and Public Policy at Yale told USA TODAY in an interview Wednesday that the presidential race, and by extension the vice presidential debate, was not revealing solutions for the nearly 38 million people living in poverty in the country.\\n\"We\\'re talking about poverty that is not an anomaly among one group of people. But in fact, is across the country, in every community, in every city,\" Barber said. \"We should really be talking about how to abolish the majority of poverty, because we know what would happen if we did have serious living minimum wage and health care.\"\\nBarber was unsparing in his criticism of falsehoods spread by Vance during the debate, including those on the Affordable Care Act and on his position on abortion.\\n\"I saw some of the un-Christian type statements coming out of Vance\\'s mouth. He wasn\\'t hollering, he wasn\\'t cussing, he wasn\\'t being belittling. He was doing it with a smile, in some sense, makes it worse,\" Barber said.\\nRev. Barber wants greater focus on poverty in campaign\\nBarber criticized the debate for lacking questions about those facing poverty and working for low wages, specifically raising the federal minimum wage to what he called a living minimum wage.\\n\"To not have that as a major question and drill it down and make these candidates answer the question is a failing, we believe of the debate system,\" Barber said.\\nThe last attempt to raise the federal minimum wage occurred in 2021 when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) added a proposal as an amendment to the March COVID-19 stimulus bill. The amendment was defeated when eight Democrats voted with the entirety of the Republicans in the Senate, 58-42.\\nBarber recognized that the Biden administration has taken executive action to raise the minimum wage for federal workers to $15 per hour in 2021, after the Sanders amendment was defeated.\\nThe last successful raising of the minimum wage came in 2009.\\n\"Everything else has gone up,\" Barber said. \"Prices have gone up, the amount of work has gone up, and yet we\\'re in 2009 with the minimum wage. It is really at almost like 1960s level in terms of buying power.\"\\nBarber noted that Walz brought up the campaign\\'s plans for expanding the child tax credit and increasing access to housing, but felt that not having the needs of the nation\\'s poor explicitly addressed in a question was the responsibility of the moderators.\\n\"I think there\\'s a great failure of the press, of those who planned the debate, and even the politicians themselves, for not putting millions of people at the center of the political debate,\" Barber said.\\nBarber noted that the moment when Walz referenced his faith and Matthew 25:40 from the Bible, it appeared the Democratic candidate was speaking, \"from the heart.\"\\n\"The thing he was saying, he was saying, as a matter of faith, there\\'s plenty of clear directions for how you should operate in the political square as a person of faith and who happens to be elected,\" Barber said.\\nBarber called Vance\\'s falsehoods during the debate both anti-Christian and anti-faith.\\nVance professes to be a Catholic, however Barber echoed the message of James 2:26 when comparing the Republican vice presidential candidate\\'s words and actions.\\n\"To be a nation where the leadership is talking about driving people out of the country, rather than being welcoming to people coming in the country, and then to stand up and say, but I\\'m a person of faith. It makes your claim of faith suspect at best and a form of heresy at worst,\" Barber said.\\nBarber further said that the stories that Vance has admitted to making up about Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, which the Republican candidate admitted to creating, were inherently against the spirit of the Constitution and should be disqualifying for voters.\\n\"When you put your hand on the Constitution, you swear to uphold it. That means you swear to tell truth, and what you say is that you\\'re going to be about establishing justice. Lying doesn\\'t establish justice,\" Barber said. \"When you put your hand on that constitution, or on a Bible, and swear to uphold that constitution you swear you\\'re going to promote and provide for the common defense. When you lie on people and immigrants and others, you\\'re not providing the common defense, and you certainly are not ensuring domestic tranquilities, because lies create confusion, and the lies that Vance is telling actually create hate.\"\\nBarber proposes debate format that puts facts first\\nBarber proposed in the interview that in the unlikely event that there is a second debate between Harris and Trump that the format should change.\\nThe reverend proposed a format resembling a town hall with the wrinkle of a non-partisan expert on the topic providing the facts prior to any question being asked by a person affected by the topic.\\n\"You put the facts out there up front, and then put a face on the facts,\" Barber said.\\nBarber noted that CBS moderators Norah O\\'Donnell and Margaret Brennan began some of their questions by citing sources, though the pair\\'s only fact check of the night came when Vance returned to the stories about Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio that the Republican candidate admitted to creating.\\n\"When you\\'re dealing with this level of lying and distortion, and when you\\'re dealing with people who just want to run the clock out, they know they got two minutes, so they just talk, talk, talk, and they know that they are not going to have time to come back,\" Barber said. \"You can\\'t just present the same thing, because they didn\\'t end up using the media. They use the debates to create more distortion and say things and make it look normal and really it\\'s not.\"',\n",

But my literary contributors never take a week off.\\nGary writes: All of this \"pay-for play\" garbage is just that, a bunch of garbage. Another reason among others that I no longer purchase tickets to UT events. I know you\\'ll say, no big deal, others will and that\\'s fine with me, but they won\\'t be getting any $$$$ from me.\\nDanny White is revered by so many UT fans, but he doesn\\'t have the courtesy or integrity to answer an email from me, so there\\'s no respect from me for him. Obviously, he couldn\\'t care less about a \"mere fan\" like me, but that\\'s okay. I couldn\\'t care less about an AD like him.\\nThis \"talent fee\", NIL, revenue-sharing garbage will kill college sports. Greed, greed, and more greed by all concerned.\\nMy response: White is a busy man. He must come up with more money-making ideas to handle the fast-rising costs of college football. That alone is a full-time job.\\nSo, don\\'t be too hard on him for not responding to your email.\\nBut since I work only about 12 hours a week, feel free to email me about anything. Not only will I likely respond. I will publish your email.\\nShemp writes: Playing teams the caliber of Kent State is a disgrace. However, Tennessee has a habit of scheduling teams that have given up and returned to football as well as schools that have only started FBS programs, all of which are pretty weak − such as Charlotte, Georgia State, Austin Peay, etc.\\nWhite didn\\'t schedule any of these although he got rid of Army. He is a pragmatist and knows that down the road people will only remember the W\\'s and L\\'s and not who they were against.\\nMy response: There\\'s little incentive to schedule prominent programs for nonconference games. Life is tough enough in the SEC.\\nLSU lost its opener to Southern Cal. Texas A&M lost its opener to Notre Dame. Had they scheduled more strategically, both would be unbeaten.\\nI recommend scheduling lower-echelon MAC teams and one terribly infirm Power Four nonconference opponent. That\\'s in keeping with my philosophy on selecting column topics: Always choose the easiest one.\\nMike writes: Thoughts after this weekend\\'s games:\\nDuring the first half, Alabama played like perhaps the best college team I have ever seen. I was actually surprised that Georgia was able to get back into that game.\\nIf Lane Kiffin was a better coach, he wouldn\\'t need to have his players fake injuries.\\nMy response: Even the best coaches – except Tennessee\\'s Josh Heupel, of course – fake injuries.\\nSome people believe Heupel\\'s offensive linemen fake injuries after UT\\'s extra-points kicks to give his offensive players a break. That\\'s ridiculous.\\nEverybody knows blocking on an extra-point kick is one of the most dangerous assignments in all of sports. Even a daredevil like Evel Knievel was afraid to try it.\\nFortunately for Tennessee, its training staff is so competent that those \\'seriously injured\\' players are always able to return for the next extra-point try.\\nColorado Mark writes: As a longtime detractor of Korntucky, uhh, make that Kentucky, I personally want to thank coach Mark Stoops for his team\\'s victory over Ole Miss, and that so-called coaching genius, Lane Kiffin.\\nAnd for those who still think Kiffin is a coaching genius, let me remind you, he has never won a title or championship. He is really good at beating overmatched teams from the little leagues.\\nMy response: I hate to spoil your out-of-character lovefest for Stoops, but he also has a history of beating lesser opponents. How else do you think his Kentucky teams have qualified for so many bowls.\\nWhen Florida finally gets around to dismissing Billy Napier from its premises, it will pursue Kiffin, not Stoops.\\nCheck that. Given Florida\\'s hiring history, perhaps it would prefer Stoops to Kiffin.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'On Wednesday night, Nashville was bumpin\\' that, bumpin\\' that, bumpin\\' that and feeling the rush.\\nPop sensation Troye Sivan and \"Brat Summer\" star Charli XCX were finally here for their sold-out show in Music City. The audience welcomed them with a cult-like dedication, filling the arena with thousands of neon green get-ups and pairs of skinny sunglasses.\\n\"Apple,\" \"Von dutch\" and \"360\" electronic pop artist Charli XCX, born Charlotte Emma Aitchison, brought the coheadlining \"Sweat Tour\" to Bridgestone Arena alongside \"Rush\" and \"One Of Your Girls\" singer Sivan, an Australian LGBTQ+ hitmaker.\\nThe joint tour saw the two artists switching off sets over an 110-minute show, playing no more than four tracks before handing the mic back to the other artist. For a few highly-anticipated tunes, XCX and Sivan took the stage together.\\nThe two musical collaborators and friends kicked off their 21-date tour on Sept. 14 in Detroit and stopped in Nashville for their tenth show of the run. The joint tour is the largest fully headlining arena tour for both artists, marking momentous career booms for them both.\\nSivan\\'s October 2023 album \"Something To Give To Each Other\" earned two Grammy nominations and worldwide recognition.\\nAnd as for XCX — it\\'s been nearly impossible to ignore her grip on the music scene and pop culture at large with the 2024 social phenomenon \"Brat Summer\" sweeping the whole planet after release of her album \"Brat\" in June.\\nThe album became synonymous with a lime green hue, a lifestyle of party girl fun, smudged eyeliner and unapologetic — even brazen — confidence. Presidential candidate Kamala Harris even rallied around \"Brat,\" using the font and color in her campaign.\\nAs Charli XCX\\'s fame skyrocketed, many fans wondered if a joint tour was the best decision for her career. But on Tuesday, the highly-collaborative nature of the show was anything but disappointing.\\nThough no photographers were allowed into the show, we\\'ll do our best to paint the picture for you.\\nHere are the night\\'s highlights.\\nCharli XCX brings \\'Club Classics,\\' turns Nashville a discotheque\\nFans were ravenous to see Charli XCX perform at the height of her career — and she brought the heat.\\nXCX transported Nashville to what felt like an inclusive European nightclub full of strobes, heavy bass and unpredictable beats and blares.\\nA giant \"Brat\" banner dropped down around a stage jutting into the audience and after anticipation built, the sheet dropped to reveal XCX in a wedding veil, white bodysuit and her trademark sunglasses.\\nThroughout the evening, XCX sported a new outfit almost every time she hit the stage: a tight orange number, a tattered long skirt, multiple pairs of funky, knee-high boots.\\nCharli started her show with hit \"365\" alongside the show\\'s opener, Shygirl, launching the crowd into a high-energy, aggressive exercise in the best of electronic dance-pop. Flashing lights rained down throughout crowd-pleasers like \"Von dutch,\" \"Club classics,\" and the darker \"Sympathy is a knife.\"\\nThoughout her performance, XCX was chaotic and frenzied, but in a cool girl way.\\nShe kicked and punched the air, climbed up railings and stage accessories, grabbed and shook the metal cage beneath the catwalk. She grinded and thrusted and gyrated in a raw and aggressive, yet sensual, manner.\\nHer lawless stage presence seemed to suggest: Move over rockstars, hyperpop entertainers can do it too.\\nIn a sexually-charged performance of \"Guess,\" Charli licked the glass stage below her and a camera broadcast the shot from down below while she sang, \"you wanna guess the color of my underwear.\" Fans went wild.\\nDuring \"Apple,\" XCX called on the camera men to find some cute fans to video performing the viral TikTok dance to the song, displaying the stream behind the stage as she sang. Older hit \"Spring Breakers\" had the audience thrashing.\\nAs she performed, XCX traded back and forth with Sivan. \"Nashville, you\\'re as sexy as Troye Sivan tonight,\" she said.\\nSivan brings the \\'rush\\'\\nWhile Sivan is a global pop star, the sea of \"Brat\" shirts in the audience suggested many fans were there for XCX. At first, as the two performers quickly traded off sets, a few disoriented audience members would file in and out depending on who was onstage.\\nOne critique of the tour lies in the fact that the quick trade-offs between the stars left a clunky, whiplash-inducing show where, at times, it was difficult to follow along.\\nXCX was unpolished and, well, brat. Sivan\\'s set was perfectly choreographed and thoughtfully designed. But for some audience members, the stage tradeoffs may echo XCX\\'s music: exhilarating, unpredictable and attention-keeping.\\nSome critics have mentioned that the \"Sweat Tour\" was stolen by XCX — I would argue, instead, that Sivan had to convince some audience members of his coheadlining efficacy. He lived up to the task.\\nHe opened the show with \"Got Me Started\" alongside six backup dancers, wearing an earthy tank top and fringy beige pants. Like XCX, Sivan returned to the stage with a handful of outfit changes, like a corset top, black chic hoodie and baggy pants with a white feather boa as a belt.\\nSongs \"My My My!,\" \"One of Your Girls\" and \"STUD\" featured high-energy dance combos, chock-full of steamy moments that celebrated queer community and sensuality.

       "   'summary': 'Tuesday night\\'s vice-presidential debate featured a brief moment of shared empathy between the candidates when Gov. Tim Walz recounted a time when his teenage son witnessed a shooting.\\nWhile answering a question about gun violence, Walz, the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, said his 17-year-old son witnessed a shooting at a community center while he was there playing volleyball.\\n\\'Those things don\\'t leave you,\" Walz said Tuesday on the debate stage.\\nThe admission left Walz\\'s Republican opponent JD Vance shaking his head in sadness, muttering, \"that\\'s awful.\"\\nGus Walz witnessed shooting in 2023 at St. Paul rec center, reports say\\nThe personal moment came while Walz and Vance were being questioned about gun violence, particularly school shootings.\\nThe Harris campaign told both the Washington Post and New York Times that Walz was referring to a shooting that happened in January 2023 at the Jimmy Lee Recreation Center in Saint Paul.\\nUSA TODAY has reached out to the Harris campaign and a representative for Walz for more information.\\nAccording to Minnesota Public Radio, which covered the attack, a 26-year-old employee at the center shot a teenager during a fight. The center is across the street from Central High School in St. Paul, where Gus Walz is a student.\\nThough the 16-year-old victim survived, he had to have a portion of his skull removed and still suffers from seizures, MPR reported.\\nAfter sharing about his son, Walz continued, \\'as a member of Congress, I sat in my office surrounded by dozens of the Sandy Hook parents, and they were looking at my 7-year-old\\'s picture on the wall. Their 7-year-olds were dead, and they were asking us to do something.\\'\\nVance to Walz: \\'It is awful\\'\\nWalz\\'s disclosure appeared to elicit sympathy from Sen. Vance (R-Ohio,) who called gun violence a \\'terrible epidemic\\' during the debate.\\n\\'Tim, first of all, I didn\\'t know that your 17-year-old witnessed a shooting, and I\\'m sorry about that,\\' Vance said after Walz was done speaking.\\n\\'Christ have mercy,\" he continued, \"it is awful.\\'\\n\\'I appreciate it,\\' Walz responded.\\nWhile the candidates on both tickets have said they are gun owners, Vance and Walz largely disagree on how best to curb the epidemic of gun violence in the United States – the leading cause of death among children and teens.\\nVance, who opposes most gun control legislation, focused on improving security around the schools and blamed gun violence on immigration issues at the border.\\n\"I unfortunately think that we have to increase security in our schools,\" Vance said. \"We have to make the doors lock better. We have to make the doors stronger. We\\'ve got to make the windows stronger, and of course, we\\'ve got to increase school resource officers.\"\\nWalz, meanwhile, focused on gun control legislation and touted his record in Minnesota passing enhanced background checks while selling firearms.\\n\"We understand that the Second Amendment is there, but our first responsibility is to our kids to figure this out,\" he said.\\nAmid the policy differences, Walz did take a moment to note that he and Vance, both fathers, were in agreement that shootings were \\'abhorrent.\\'\\n\\'I do think that this is a good start to the conversation,\\' Walz said.',\n",

If it becomes a tropical storm, it would likely get the name Leslie.\\nAtlantic storm tracker\\nBrace for \\'return of big hurricanes\\' in October\\nThe 2024 Atlantic hurricane season entered its fifth month Tuesday, and experts are again taking stock of a deadly and puzzling season.\\nThe year started with dire predictions of a hyperactive season, quickly followed by the explosive and record-breaking landfall of Beryl in early July. Then came an odd mismatch in Pacific and Atlantic activity a later mid-season lull.\\nBut now, with Hurricane Helene\\'s deadly and devastating rampage across the Southeast last week, any hope of a quiet hurricane season for the U.S. has been obliterated.\\nUnfortunately, there\\'s still plenty of the season still to go, and \"October is historically an active month, particularly in the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico and off the U.S. Southeast coast,\" said Brian McNoldy, a hurricane research scientist at the University of Miami\\'s Rosenstiel School.\\n\"I would say that Helene doesn\\'t really have any bearing on the rest of the season\\'s forecast, but right now, large-scale conditions are highly conducive for tropical cyclone formation in the eastern Atlantic, and we\\'re seeing storms taking advantage of these conditions,\" said Phil Klotzbach, a senior research scientist at Colorado State University. \"We just released our latest two-week forecast, and we are calling for a very busy two weeks, due to Kirk, Invest 91L (the wave behind Kirk) and potentially a system in the Northwest Caribbean/Gulf.\"\\nUsing the storm names that have been retired since 1953 as a proxy for landfalling storms that had great impact, September has the most retired names, with 43, McNoldy said. August and October are essentially tied at 21 and 20, and only seven storm names have been retired from November storms.\\nHowever, it\\'s also worth noting that October and November together have more retired storm names than June, July and August combined, he said. \"So we must absolutely still be on alert for tropical cyclone threats in the remainder of hurricane season.\"\\nIt\\'s also important to remember that it doesn\\'t take a strong hurricane to cause a lot of damage, McNoldy said. \"A slow-moving disorganized disturbance that maybe doesn\\'t quite become a tropical storm can unleash feet of rain over an area and create terrible flash flooding,\" he said. \"The rainfall threat from tropical systems has historically taken a back seat to the wind threat in people\\'s minds, despite being deadlier.\"',\n",

       "   'summary': 'The ACLU on Wednesday sued for information about the federal government\\'s capacity to massively detain and deport immigrants.\\nThe lawsuit comes during a U.S. election season in which immigration has been central to the presidential campaign. Republican Donald Trump has promised a \"mass deportation\" of unauthorized immigrants, while Democrat Kamala Harris has pushed for tougher restrictions on asylum seekers at the border.\\n\"If a mass deportation and detention system ends up being established by a future administration, we have many concerns about how that could impact the civil rights and civil liberties of immigrants,\" said Kyle Virgien, senior staff attorney at the ACLU\\'s National Prison Project.\\nIn the complaint filed in the U.S. Southern District of New York, the ACLU claims the federal government spends billions each year to fund detention and deportation infrastructure, yet \"much of the specific information about how this detention and deportation apparatus operates is unavailable to the public.\"\\nThe ACLU first sought documents under the Freedom of Information Act in August, but the requests went unanswered, Virgien said.\\nThe lawsuit targets the Department of Homeland Security and agencies under its purview including U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Border Patrol, as well as the Department of Justice. USA TODAY has reached out to DHS and DOJ for comment on the lawsuit.\\nA mass deportation effort to remove 1 million people per year could cost $88 billion annually, according new research by the nonpartisan American Immigration Council. It could take 10 years to deport the unauthorized population in the U.S. and could cost more than $900 billion in total, the council said in its report.\\nThere are roughly 11 million unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S., according to estimates by the Pew Research Center.\\nOn its website, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, lists 91 detention facilities nationwide that it operates or uses, including federal \"processing centers\" and detention centers, as well as county jails, where apprehended immigrants may be held in the custody of the U.S. Marshals.\\nBut a 2018 report by the American Immigration Council found that ICE relied on many more detention facilities. The organization said ICE detained people at 630 sites and that \"individuals detained by ICE were commonly held in privately operated and remotely located facilities, far away from basic community support structures and legal advocacy networks.\"\\nAs of Sept. 8, ICE held 37,395 immigrants in detention, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, which seeks federal records through standing FOIA requests. Sixty percent of immigrants held in ICE detention had no criminal record, according to TRAC.\\nICE states on its website that \"detention is non-punitive\" and that detention facilities owned or operated by ICE, by a state or local entity or government contractor \"must comply with one of several sets of detention standards.\"\\nInvestigations by USA TODAY and others have repeatedly found issues with medical care in detention, access to legal representation and complications associated with detaining families.\\nThe ACLU is seeking records that demonstrate the government\\'s capacity to detain, house and transport immigrants. The lawsuit asks for information on ICE\\'s maximum bed space, including under hotel contracts; DHS\\' ability to transfer its personnel from one sub-agency to another; the department\\'s ground transportation capabilities, among other records.\\nIf the next administration decides to increase immigrant detention and deportations, \"we worry that there would be a lot of real problems with how it ramps up,\" Virgien said.',\n",

       "   'summary': \"Editor's note: This is a regular feature on issues related to the Constitution and civics education written by Paul G. Summers, retired judge and state attorney general.\\nThe District of Columbia (D.C.) is the seat of the government of the United States.\\nD.C. is not a state, nor does it have voting representatives in Congress. It operates through the laws passed by Congress. Currently D.C. has a population of about 800,000; residents pay local and federal taxes. They have served in the military and defended our country.\\nIn 1961, our 23rd amendment was ratified; and residents of the District of Columbia were given the constitutional right to vote for the President and Vice President. D.C. residents now have three electoral votes.\\nHow the 23 rd Amendment intersects with other amendments\\nUnder Section 1 of the amendment:\\n'…Congress may direct: A number of electors of President and Vice President equal to the whole number of Senators and Representatives in Congress to which the District would be entitled if it were a State, but in no event more than the least populous State; they shall be in addition to those appointed by the States, but they shall be considered, for the purposes of the election of President and Vice President, to be electors appointed by a State….'\\nThe rest of this amendment states that Congress may enforce this amendment by appropriate legislation.\\nThe electors will meet in the District. Further, as electors, they will follow the 12th Amendment to the Constitution. Ratified in 1804, the 12th Amendment provides the procedure for electors to cast their ballots for the president and the vice president every four years.\\nConsistent with both the 12th and the 23rd Amendments, the District of Columbia is treated like a state for the purpose of the Electoral College. D.C. is entitled to three electoral votes.\\nKeep reading and studying the Constitution\\nWe shall continue our study in the next article about the 24th Amendment. It speaks of the poll tax 'or other tax' in voting in federal elections.\\nPlease continue to read the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. We promise you that such study is time well spent.\\nThe guest columnist strives to be nonpartisan in voluntarily delivering his articles. The publication is responsible for graphics and design, titles, editing and production. We appreciate our readers and encourage civil discourse on articles. We always enjoy civil comments from readers on the various articles by the guest columnist.\\nPaul G. Summers, a lawyer, is a former appellate and senior judge, district attorney general, and the Attorney General of Tennessee.

Employees of the company have alleged management didn\\'t allow workers to leave the facility even as flood warnings were issued and floodwaters from the Nolichucky River swamped the building.\\nTwo of the women in the group of Impact Plastics employees died, according to an immigrants rights group that has been working with families of some of the employees who worked there. At least three are missing. The company confirmed the death of one person but did not give details about their identity.\\nKnox News has detailed how a group of employees jumped on the back of a flatbed semitruck parked at the business next door as waters rose waist-high in the Riverview Industrial Park where both businesses are located.\\nThe truck was swarmed by flood waters from the raging Nolichucky River and eventually flipped. The factory sits a mile north of Unicoi County Hospital, the site of a dramatic helicopter rescue that same day of 62 staff and patients stranded on the roof as the river brook loose from its banks.\\nA TBI spokesperson confirmed Oct. 1 that District Attorney Steve Finney requested the TBI investigate the business, though the spokesperson declined to offer details about the investigation other than that it involves Impact Plastics.\\nFinney released a statement saying, \"\"Early yesterday morning, I spoke with the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation and requested that they look into allegations involving Impact Plastics in Unicoi County, Tennessee. Specifically, I asked that they review the occurrences of Friday, September 27, 2024, to identify any potential criminal violations.\"\\nEmployees said they couldn\\'t leave\\nImpact Plastics employee Jacob Ingram told Knox News on Sept. 30 that managers wouldn\\'t let employees leave and other employees have repeated the claim after press conferences and to other media outlets.\\nInstead, managers told people to move their cars away from the rising water. Ingram moved his car two separate times because the water wouldn\\'t stop rising.\\n\\'They should\\'ve evacuated when we got the flash flood warnings, and when they saw the parking lot,\\' Ingram told Knox News. \\'When we moved our cars we should\\'ve evacuated then … we asked them if we should evacuate, and they told us not yet, it wasn\\'t bad enough.\\n\\'And by the time it was bad enough, it was too late unless you had a four-wheel-drive.\\'\\nThe company, via a written statement issued Sept. 30, denied allegations that management forced anyone to continue working as waters rose outside. Further, the statement said, while most employees left immediately, some remained on or near the premises. It reiterated management and assistants were the last to exit the building.\\nTony Treadway, a spokesperson for the company, told Knox News the TBI had not contacted them as of 11 a.m. Oct. 2. He said the company is conducting its own internal review \"of activities and timelines of September 27th\" and said the company would share the information when the review is complete.\\nThe dead and the missing\\nKnox News verified at least five of the employees who were on the truck are either confirmed dead or are missing.\\nOne of the employees who died, Bertha Mendoza, 56, fell off the truck and vanished into the flood, according to Ingram and a representative from Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition.\\nMendoza was separated from her sister as the two tried to stay afloat, according to a GoFundMe page dedicated to her. Her body was found Sept. 29. Mendoza has not been publicly identified by officials.\\nMonica Hernandez has been confirmed dead, according to the immigrants rights coalition, who said it confirmed her death with her family, who learned of it from the Unicoi County Emergency Management Agency on Oct. 1. Hernandez has not been publicly identified by officials.\\nRosa Maria Andrade Reynoso, was missing as of Oct. 1. Her husband, Francesco Guerro, told Knox News through a translator that she was in communication with him throughout the morning and wasn\\'t sure if she could get out. She told him to take care of their kids, he said.\\nAnother woman, Lydia Verdugo, has been identified as missing, according to the immigrants rights coalition. She has not been publicly identified by officials.\\nA man, Johnny Peterson, has been identified as dead by NBC News, but the outlet could not confirm he was an employee of Impact Plastics. He was on the truck as well, according to Ingram. Peterson has not been publicly identified by officials and Knox News has not confirmed whether he\\'s missing or dead.',\n",

The win was the first for the Commodores after being 0-60 against AP top-5 opposition before Saturday. It was Vanderbilt\\'s first win over Alabama since 1984.\\nWhile fans carried the goalposts from the victory down Broadway to celebrate, Bargatze honored the Commodores himself at the end of his monologue by gesturing \"Anchor Down\" with his hands. He again gave the Vanderbilt football team a massive shutout at the show\\'s end.\\n\\'VANDERBILT BEAT ALABAMA,\" Bargatze proclaimed while flexing.\\nBargatze, 45, was born in Nashville and still resides there. Despite being known as a Vanderbilt fan, in 2023, he was a guest picker for the Crimson Tide on ESPN\\'s \"College GameDay\" when Alabama hosted LSU.',\n",

Rudolph\\'s numbers were modest (9-of-17, 87 passing yards), but the Titans led throughout the game.\\nTitans coach Brian Callahan said after Monday\\'s game and again on Tuesday that Levis will be the team\\'s starting quarterback when he\\'s healthy. Callahan said part of the reason that Levis sat for the majority of the Dolphins game was the bye week and the extra rest time he could have to get back to 100% health.\\n\"There was no doubt in my mind that that was the right thing to do for him,\" Callahan said. \"Especially with the bye and the style of game, I felt like instead of risking further injury or further shots on his shoulder, it was the right thing to do in the moment.\"\\nIt is notable both that the Titans offense did not turn the ball over when Rudolph played in Miami and that the Titans\\' passing game lacked explosiveness. But Callahan wants to find out about his second-year QB.\\n\"We\\'re going to find out everything about Will we can,\" Callahan said. \"He\\'s going to continue to grow and get better and play better.

       "   'summary': \"FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. – Tennessee football fans were in disbelief when quarterback Nico Iamaleava inexplicably ran out of bounds after time expired to seal a 19-14 shocking loss to Arkansas on Saturday.\\nAnd they all had the same thought: I can't believe it happened again.\\nIn 2021, UT quarterback Joe Milton ran out of bounds rather than attempt a pass into the end zone on the final play of a 31-26 loss to Ole Miss.\\n'(It was) a different situation,' coach Josh Heupel said after the loss when asked why that specific mistake has happened twice. 'Older quarterback versus first (year) guy experience.'\\nThat's probably not the explanation that UT fans want to hear. But none would've been satisfactory after the No. 4 Vols (4-1, 1-1 SEC) had such a lackluster performance against the Razorbacks (4-2, 2-1).\\nIt's three years too late to try to make sense of Milton's mistake.\\nBut why did Iamaleava commit the same baffling error?\\nNico Iamaleava's account of final play\\nThere were six seconds remaining when UT snapped the ball from the Arkansas 20-yard line.\\nAnd after Iamaleava scrambled, it was clear that the clock had expired. Yet he kept running to his right, never attempted a pass and then ran out of bounds to finish the game.\\nAfter the loss, the redshirt freshman tried to explain his mistake.\\n'As I rolled out, I saw (Dont'e Thornton) coming open. But if I threw that ball, it was going to be batted down right away,' Iamaleava said. 'So I tried to let Chris Brazzell work a little bit, and he was covered at the time.\\n'As soon as I was trying to let the ball go, I felt it slipping in my hand. I've got to do a better job of holding the ball.'\\nSo Iamaleava was trying to find an open receiver rather than just any receiver. And when he finally found an option that was better than nothing, he couldn't grip the ball to deliver the pass.\\nThen he ran out of real estate.\\nJosh Heupel: 'You can't keep the ball in your hands'\\nArkansas fans immediately stormed the field in celebration after the play. UT players pushed their way to the locker room.\\nA few minutes later, Heupel knew the question about the final play was coming in the postgame press conference.\\n'In that scenario you've got to get the ball up and give one of your guys an opportunity to make a play,' Heupel said. 'You can't keep the ball in your hands. You want to give somebody an opportunity to go make a play. (Iamaleava) is disappointed with it. But he's got to come back and bounce back from it.\\n'Nico, just like me and just like our football team, wishes we would've played better.'\\nIamaleava was 16-of-28 passing for 156 yards. He was under constant pressure throughout the game, and the Vols never fully adjusted.\\nIt was also Iamaleava's first loss as a starter. He had won his first five starts in a streak that dated back to the Citrus Bowl last season.\\nNow the former five-star recruit must lead UT in a rebound game against Florida on Oct. 12 (7 p.m. ET, ESPN) at Neyland Stadium.\\n'He's played too good not to respond the right way,' Heupel said. 'And I know he will.'\",\n",

       "   'excerpt': \"Here's how Vanderbilt football, led by Clark Lea and Diego Pavia, pulled an upset over No. 1 Alabama.\",\n",
       "   'summary': 'Clark Lea made it through one sentence of his opening statement before choking up.\\nHe had just led Vanderbilt football to a 40-35 win over Alabama, the first win over an AP No. 1 ranked team in school history. Not only had the Commodores never beaten a No. 1 team, they\\'d never even beat a top-5 team on the field.\\n\"A great night for our program, and one that we\\'ve worked really hard to make happen. So we\\'ve been emotional to this very point. Of course, right when I get in front of you guys, I\\'m going to get emotional.\"\\nUnder Lea, Jerry Kill and quarterback Diego Pavia, Vanderbilt has had an \"any given Saturday\" attitude. On Tuesday, during the team\\'s weekly press conference, Pavia said that only God knew who was going to win the game.\\nBut it didn\\'t take the work of the divine on Saturday. The Commodores played like the better team from the beginning, taking a 13-0 lead just seven minutes in after a touchdown drive and a pick-6. They never relinquished the lead.\\nFour different Vanderbilt players scored touchdowns, and that doesn\\'t include Pavia, who threw two touchdown passes. The Commodores forced two turnovers: the pick-6 and a fourth quarter strip sack of Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe. While penalties have been a problem all season, this time, Vanderbilt committed just three.\\nLea knows Vanderbilt. He\\'s a Nashville native who played for the Commodores in the early 2000s. He took over the program in 2021 and in only one of his three years has the team even won an SEC game. Never before in his time with the program has Lea experienced anything like Saturday.\\nFans stormed the field. Students tore down the goalposts and took them to Broadway, eventually dumping them in the Cumberland River. The mayor posted about the result on social media. The FirstBank Stadium video board operators trolled Alabama by playing a video of Nick Saban saying Vanderbilt wasn\\'t a hard place to play. And they did this all with the majority of the stands filled with Alabama fans.\\n\"We expected to win that game,\" Lea said. \"That\\'s not shocking to me. You know, I was going to be emotional no matter what, because it\\'s a big win, and to capture that stadium ... just a picture in my mind of what the dream is. That is the dream. That\\'s why I came here. It\\'s what I came here to do.\"\\nPavia has a chip on his shoulder from having no Division I offers out of high school and no Power 4 offers besides Vanderbilt in the transfer portal, even after two successful seasons at New Mexico State. He never shies away from a challenge. He led the Aggies to a road win over Auburn a year ago and showed his relentless competitiveness then. Now, in postgames, he\\'ll talk about his desire to play in the NFL, go to the College Football Playoff and win a national title, even when no one else believes those things were possible.\\nFew outside the Vanderbilt locker room felt this was possible, either, but they did it.\\n\"On Tuesday, (offensive lineman Steven Hubbard) walked in and said, some people were talking and said, anything about beating Bama, get the (expletive) out of the way, I ain\\'t trying to talk to you right now,\" Pavia said. \"Every single one got behind and just had the same mentality.\"\\nTen months ago, this didn\\'t seem possible. There were long, hard days in December that Lea spent soul-searching about the future of his program after a 2-10 season. Dozens of players, including all three quarterbacks who took a snap and several other starters, entered the transfer portal. Lea fired both coordinators, took over the defense himself, imported Kill and Tim Beck from New Mexico State, brought in a haul of transfers himself. That wasn\\'t how he envisioned building up this program, but it was what had to be done.\\nOne of the toughest obstacles was shedding a loser\\'s mentality. In the past, Lea said, the team would play the victim after losses like the ones it took against Georgia State and Missouri earlier this season. But this time, the team responded differently.\\nAs Vanderbilt prepared to into victory formation late in the game, Lea looked over and saw offensive line coach Chris Klenakis with a gash on his forehead, bleeding. It was a physical representation of the blood, sweat and tears that went into this moment from everyone involved with the program.\\n\"There\\'s a belief embedded and apparent in what we do,\" Lea said. \" ... The lesson here is playing to an identity, playing to its strategy, and continuing to step into that belief.\"',\n",

       "   'summary': \"Vanderbilt football will face a $100,000 fine from the SEC for fans storming the field Saturday − and it owes the money to Alabama after the Commodores ' historic victory against the No. 1 Crimson Tide.\\nThat fine is per the SEC policy for field storming that was established in June 2023, which also stated that fines are owed to the opposing institution. The updated SEC access to competition area policy fines schools $100,000 for their first offense, $250,000 for a second offense and $500,000 for a third offense.\\nSaturday marked Vanderbilt's first offense after the Commodores knocked off Alabama in a 40-35 win at FirstBank Stadium, their first win over an AP No. 1 opponent in school history. The updated policy reset schools' prior record for fines. Fans tore down the goal post in the south end zone amid the joyous celebrations following.\\nHow much will Vanderbilt be fined for fans field storming vs Alabama?\\nVanderbilt will be docked $100,000 for Saturday's field-storming celebration although SEC Commissioner Greg Sankey can levy additional fines if he sees fit.\\nIt would have been fined $250,000 under the SEC's previous policy because it was a repeat offender for fans storming a playing surface.\\nVanderbilt was fined $250,000 for fans storming the court at Memorial Gymnasium after a buzzer-beating win against Tennessee in February 2023. That was the school's fourth incident. Vanderbilt's third incident occurred after the Commodores' football win over Florida in 2022, which also incurred a $250,000 fine.\\nPreviously, schools were penalized $50,000 for a first offense, $100,000 for a second offense and $250,000 for a third offense and each subsequent offense. The funds were donated to the SEC's Post-graduate Scholarship Fund.\\nTennessee beat No. 1 Alabama for first win vs top-ranked team in program history\\nSaturday was Vanderbilt's first win against Alabama since 1984 and the signature moment under coach Clark Lea in his fourth season.\\nCommodores quarterback Diego Pavia sliced through the Alabama defense through the air and on the ground. He was 16-for-20 for 252 yards and two touchdowns, including the decisive touchdown with 5:07 to play to put Vanderbilt ahead 40-28. Pavia also rushed for 56 yards while using his legs to make plays such as eluding the defense long enough to hoist a 36-yard touchdown pass in the third quarter.\\nRunning back Sedrick Alexander ran for two touchdowns.\\nVanderbilt (3-2, 1-1) took a 13-0 lead in the first quarter and dictated much of the game against the Crimson Tide (4-1, 1-1). Alabama got within 23-21 with a touchdown drive to open the third quarter, but Pavia made an electric play for a touchdown pass to Junior Sherrill to restore a two-possession lead.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Vanderbilt football upset Alabama 40-35 on Saturday at FirstBank Stadium, and as could be expected, fans stormed the field and tore down the goalposts in the south end zone.\\nThe Commodores ' previous win against Alabama on the field came in 1984, with the lone other victory being a retroactive forfeit in 1993. They haven't defeated a top-10 team since 2007 and haven't ever defeated an AP No. 1 ranked team.\\nVanderbilt suffered close defeats to Georgia State and Missouri before its idle week. It was clear this team, led by New Mexico State transfer quarterback Diego Pavia, was improved, but it still would need some major upsets to make it to a bowl, something coach Clark Lea hadn't done as he entered his fourth season.\\nWell, this qualifies. Now the sky feels like the limit.\\nHere are three overreactions from the game:\\nThis could be the biggest win in Vanderbilt history\\nVanderbilt has never defeated an AP No. 1-ranked team. Alabama is No. 2 in the US LBM Coaches Poll, but the Commodores haven't defeated a No. 2-ranked team on the field, either. (The Commodores have a retroactive forfeit victory against then-No. 2 Alabama in 1993, but that game was originally a loss for Vanderbilt.)\\nThe SEC has gotten only more difficult, with a huge gulf between the haves and have-nots. That's what makes this game so shocking — and so monumental. The impacts could go far beyond the field, too. Recruits considering Vanderbilt saw what happened.\\nClark Lea called an exceptional game\\nLea got the Vanderbilt job for his work as Notre Dame's defensive coordinator. He's had his ups and downs as head coach, but he showed his chops as a defensive play-caller Saturday. Jalen Milroe is one of the country's top dual-threat quarterbacks, but the Commodores took his running ability almost completely out of the game. For the most part, Vanderbilt also kept top receiver Ryan Williams in check.\\nThe Commodores also forced two turnovers, including a pick-six.\\nDiego Pavia is a dude\\nEver since the upset win over Virginia Tech to start the season, Pavia-mania has taken over the Vanderbilt campus. Even athletes in other sports are now wearing Pavia's jersey.\\nUnlike Milroe, Pavia won't be a first-round NFL draft pick. But he's one hell of a college quarterback, and the Commodores have ascended to a new level with him. Pavia at New Mexico State proved he isn't scared of a highly rated opponent. On Saturday, he made nearly all the right moves.\",\n",

Walz, currently Minnesota\\'s governor, spent at least an hour inside the event Saturday afternoon.\\n\"Ohio is important,\" said Cincinnati Vice Mayor Jan-Michele Lemon Kearney, who helped plan the event. \"We have to turn out the vote. Just because we\\'re not a swing state, doesn\\'t mean our vote doesn\\'t matter.\"\\n\"Gov. Tim Walz in person is the real deal,\" added Cincinnati City Council member Seth Walsh. \"Who you see on TV is who we got in person. His authenticity and commitment to improving our country blew me away. The room was energized but only got more as he spoke. That\\'s because he\\'s speaking about real problems and solutions to those problems that face us all.\"\\nFormer Ohio Health Director Dr. Amy Acton – who served during the pandemic and, as she put it, is \"strongly considering\" running for Ohio governor in 2026 − was seen leaving the event with former Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper, who is fresh off turning his book about Project 2025 into a podcast.\\nWalz delivered a \"moving message\" about values the Democratic Party holds dear, Acton said, adding: \"People are tired of the hate.\"\\nThe National Underground Railroad Freedom Center opened on the Ohio River in downtown Cincinnati in 2004, a museum dedicated to the stories of the Underground Railroad. Funk legend Bootsy Collins warmed up the crowd with his music.\\nA group of protestors, Students for Justice in Palestine University of Cincinnati chapter, shared their message outside the event, although they never saw Walz, who entered the building from an underground parking garage. They called for an arms embargo.\\nAlso at the fundraiser was actor, director and activist Mario Van Peebles, who directed and acted in the cult classic \"New Jack City\" and portrayed political Icon Malcolm X in the movie \"ALI.\" Van Peebles Mario is currently starring and directing a film on Harry and Harriet Moore, who were known as the Bonnie and Clyde of voting rights, but took the day off filming in Toronto to come to Cincinnati.\\n\"We are at an inflection point,\" Van Peebles said. \"Our daughters are in danger as their rights are being taken away.\" He is a father of three daughters and said he felt called to attend events in person to support the Democratic ticket.\\nAfter his stop in Cincinnati, Walz left for Cleveland where he was set to headline another fundraising event.\\nVice President Kamlaa Harris visited North Carolina on Saturday to survey the impact of Tropical Storm Helene and get a briefing about recovery efforts.\\nCincinnati-area Democrats were hoping to bring Harris to the region, with Lemon Kearney even helping raise at least $1 million to make that happen, she told USA TODAY Network last week. However, with only 30 days until the election, Cincinnati got Walz instead.\\nHarris has focused campaigning in swing states, such as Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Many no longer consider Ohio a swing state after former President Donald Trump won it in 2016 and 2020 by eight percentage points.\\nThe USA TODAY Network sought permission from the Harris/Walz campaign to cover the private Cincinnati event, but was denied.\\n\"Thanks for reaching out,\" said Emily Soong, who responded to the request made to Monica Medvedec, the Midwest Finance Director for the Harris Victory Fund. \"For your planning purposes, the governor will not have any open press events tomorrow. His engagements will be covered by his travel pool for editorial coverage only.\"\\nThe event was essentially held in Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance\\'s backyard. Vance was raised in Middletown, Ohio, but now lives in the Cincinnati neighborhood of East Walnut Hills, Ohio.\\nJared Kamrass, a Democratic strategist with Washington D.C.-based Technicolor Political, said Cincinnati is an important stronghold nationally for Democrats.\\n\"While Ohio is becoming less so, Cincinnati is more relevant on the national stage for Democrats,\" Kamrass said. \"In addition to being a can\\'t-miss stop on the fundraising circuit, we were one of only two areas to defeat a Republican incumbent member of congress in 2022 (Landsman) and Greater Cincinnati will play a greater role in Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown\\'s path to victory than it ever has.\"\\nBrown is on the ballot this November running for reelection against Republican candidate Bernie Moreno.

       "   'excerpt': 'Less than a month after the release of the \"Monsters\" series, a new documentary featuring recorded phone calls of Erik and Lyle Menendez is coming to Netflix.',\n",
       "   'summary': 'With the release of the second installment of Ryan Murphy\\'s \"Monsters\" series, \" The Eric and Lyle Menendez Story,\" the Menendez brothers have once again been thrust into the spotlight.\\nUp next: a Netflix documentary promising interviews with the siblings, \"in their own words.\"\\nThe two brothers were convicted of killing their parents José and Mary Louise \\'Kitty\\' Menendez in their Mediterranean-style Beverly Hills mansion in 1989 and were sentenced to life without parole in 1996. While prosecutors asserted that Lyle, then 21, and Erik, then 18, slaughtered José and Kitty Menendez at their home for the couple\\'s $14 million fortune, Erik and Lyle claim their father abused them physically, sexually and emotionally. Erik fought back while testifying to dad\\'s abuse, which he said began when he was 6 and lasted until the time of the murders.\\nMurphy\\'s series, which presents a dramatized version of the events that unfolded, invited a lot of controversy and criticism, including from Erik Menendez, who in a statement issued through his wife Tammie Menendez, slammed the show for its \"horrible and blatant lies\" and \"vile and appalling character portrayals of Lyle and of me.\"\\nMeanwhile, Cooper Koch, the actor who portrays Erik in the series, met his real-life acting subject during an in-person prison visit last week led by Kim Kardashian, Koch told The Hollywood Reporter. While Erik had not seen the new Netflix series yet, he praised Koch for his work, the actor told THR. Kardashian, who has evolved into a leading voice on criminal justice reform, meanwhile is rallying for the release of the two brothers.\\nLos Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón in a press conference Thursday announced his office would review new evidence in the brothers\\' case, including a letter sent by one of the brothers to a family member alleging he was the victim of molestation.\\nA group of the Menendez brothers\\' family members also criticized the show as a \"phobic, gross, anachronistic, serial episodic nightmare that is not only riddled with mistruths and outright falsehoods but ignores the most recent exculpatory revelations.\"\\nMurphy, meanwhile, in interviews with Entertainment Tonight and The Hollywood Reporter, defended the show, saying his intent was to include multiple perspectives on what happened. He also went on to say that the Menendez brothers should be sending him flowers for all the attention they\\'ve been getting because of the show.\\nBrothers to revisit trial in new Netflix documentary\\nLess than a month after the nine-episode series dropped and dominated Netflix\\'s Top 10 queue, a new documentary film featuring recorded phone calls of the brothers with director Alejandro Hartmann from the Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego, where the pair are serving life sentences, is releasing on the streaming platform.\\n\"For the first time in 30 years, and in their own words, both brothers revisit the trial that shocked the nation,\" Netflix says about the upcoming film. \"Through extensive audio interviews with Lyle and Erik, lawyers involved in the trial, journalists who covered it, jurors, family, and other informed observers, acclaimed Argentinian director Alejandro Hartmann offers new insight and a fresh perspective on a case that people only think they know.\"\\nHere\\'s everything you need to know about the new documentary film spotlighting Erik and Lyle Menendez.\\nWhen does \\'The Menendez Brothers\\' documentary film release?\\n\"The Menendez Brothers\" will release on Monday, Oct. 7 at 3:00 a.m. ET.\\nHow to watch \\'The Menendez Brothers\\' documentary film?\\n\"The Menendez Brothers\" documentary film will be available to stream on Netflix.\\nWho is in \\'The Menendez Brothers\\' documentary?\\nThe film, directed by Hartmann, will feature interviews with both Erik and Lyle Menendez as well as new interviews with their cousin Diane Vander Molen and prosecutor Pamela Bozanich, as per Netflix.\\n\\'The Menendez Brothers\\' trailer\\nNetflix shared a sneak peek into the documentary on Thursday.',\n",

The Hamas infiltration on Oct. 7, 2023, unprecedented in modern Israel\\'s 76-year history, triggered a cataclysmic war in the enclave that has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.\\nFor the Berger family, like so many of Israel\\'s hostage families, it\\'s been a year of intolerable, engulfing fear, loathing and anxiety. It\\'s been a year of not knowing whether Agam Berger, 20, is alive or dead, or how she\\'s being treated by her captors. It\\'s been a year without a daughter who her father describes as a perpetual \"giver\" who volunteered to help kids with homework in the family\\'s neighborhood south of Tel Aviv, or just to play with them.\\nFor the Bergers, it\\'s been a whole year without \"our Agam.\"\\n\"What is she doing? How is she holding up? This is what breaks me,\" her father said in an interview a few weeks ahead of the one-year anniversary of Oct. 7. Hamas\\' attacks unleashed a wave of collective trauma and grief across Israel. In Gaza, whole families and neighborhoods have been wiped out. The war threatens to ignite a wider regional conflict between Israel and Iran, as well as Hamas allies in Lebanon and Yemen. There\\'s been a fresh spotlight on yearslong Palestinian suffering. A year later, the epicenter of Israeli trauma and grief still lies with the hostage families, as well as the bereaved.\\n\"To hear her playing the violin, for me it\\'s just too hard,\" Berger, 52, said of a video recording of his daughter playing Cohen\\'s spiritual, soaring and majestic hymn to the curveballs that life can throw at you.\\n\\'They\\'re not being held as prisoners of war\\'\\nAgam Berger was abducted by Hamas with five other young female soldiers from Israel\\'s Nahal Oz base just 24 hours after starting her very first job in the military as a border surveillance officer.\\nIt was a junior, yet theoretically vital, role in a location a few miles from Gaza.\\nShe was part of a unit composed chiefly of 18- to 21-year-old female soldiers whose job it was to sit on the base for hours and look out for anything suspicious. Agam Berger was to be a lookout, a spotter, a job that has taken on added significance in Israel in the wake of Oct. 7 after it emerged that several members of her unit had tried to warn their superiors that they were noticing unusual activity inside Gaza in the days and weeks before the attack.\\nMembers of Agam Berger\\'s unit informed their Israeli military bosses that Hamas appeared to be training with explosives and rehearsing attacks on a replica tank and mock observation post.\\nIf those warnings were heard, they went unheeded.\\nBeing a spotter was not a role Agam Berger coveted.\\nIn fact, to fulfill Israel\\'s compulsory requirements for military service, she had hoped to be a basic training officer. When she failed to convince the Israeli military of that she told her parents she would still do her best with what she was given.\\nThe last time her family heard directly from her was in a seven-second call from a phone number they didn\\'t recognize. She was in a safe room on the Nahal Oz base and said she could hear shooting and explosions.\\nThen the line dropped.\\nThe Berger family only learned of their daughter\\'s fate when she was pictured bloody and distraught in body camera footage released by Hamas on Oct. 8, the day after its assault. Her hands are handcuffed behind her back. She sits on the floor with other four hostages. They had just witnessed 15 of their friends and colleagues murdered in and around the base and a nearby kibbutz. Hamas launched its attack in the early morning.\\nBerger and some of the girls in the video were still wearing their pajamas.\\n\"You\\'re beautiful,\" one of the Hamas militants tells one of the terrified soldiers in the video.\\nCapturing soldiers is not technically a war crime, though mistreating them is, and experts in the rules around warfare agree that no grievance can justify holding anyone hostage, whether from civilian or military life.\\n\"There\\'s no difference between these young women soldiers and civilians,\" said Laurie Blank, an international law professor at Emory University. \"They\\'re not being held as prisoners of war,\" a category of detainee that is legal and requires giving them access to medicines, humanitarian aid and holding them in good faith.\\nOver the past year, the Berger family has had two further \"signs of life.\"\\nThe first one came in November. It was Shlomi Berger\\'s birthday. Another hostage who his daughter had been held with in Gaza was released as part of a temporary truce between Israel and Hamas.\\nThis freed hostage, with whom Agam Berger shares a first name, called the family with a message for her dad.\\n\"She asked me to say happy birthday,\" Agam Goldstein-Almog, then 17, said.\\nIt was a message she delivered even as Goldstein-Almog herself had only just escaped Gaza.\\nIn the call she says she is in a car, she is safe, and about to board a military helicopter.\\n\"I will believe she will get out of there,\" Meirav Berger, 49, Agam\\'s mother, can be heard saying in a muffled cry.\\n\"She will get out,\" Goldstein-Almog says in response.\\nThe next sign of life came in May.\\nAn Israeli intelligence officer called the Bergers out of the blue to say there was fresh information indicating their daughter was still alive. But the officer said no other details could be shared with them.\\nSince then, nothing.\\n\"Your faith was strong but you needed proof,\" Cohen sings in \"Hallelujah.\"\\nAgam Berger\\'s been playing the violin since fourth grade\\nOver the course of the last year the Berger family have been doing their best to mark birthdays, anniversaries and special occasions with as much energy and excitement as they can muster.\\nIt hasn\\'t been easy as the war has dragged on with no emerging hostage deal acceptable to both sides. In recent weeks, Israel has appeared to open a new front in the war to fight Hamas ally Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. It has done this because since Oct. 7 last year, Hezbollah has fired thousands of rockets and missiles at Israel, displacing residents of northern Israel.\\nIn late September, Israel assassinated Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. It has launched what it has called \"limited\" ground incursions into Lebanon to further destroy Hezbollah infrastructure and weapons systems. Israel\\'s major military operations in Gaza appear to be slowly winding down. It appears on the verge of an all-out war with Iran, which backs Hezbollah and Hamas.\\nIn March, the Berger family celebrated the bar mitzvah of Agam\\'s younger brother, Ilay.\\nA bar mitzvah is coming of age ceremony that\\'s intended to be a joyous and life-affirming milestone. The Bergers wanted to acknowledge that, but it was difficult.\\n\"We celebrated as much as we could,\" Shlomi Berger said.\\nIlay Berger spent part of this past summer in the U.S., at a camp in Massachusetts that caters for Jewish children. A wealthy donor paid for his trip and that of other siblings of Gaza hostages.\\nIn late August, family, friends and several musicians marked Agam Berger\\'s 20th birthday − on her 321st day in captivity − with speeches and performances of some of her favorite music pieces on the violin, piano and oud.\\nAgam Berger has been playing the violin since the fourth grade.\\n\"You are far from us on your birthday, in the dark, but so close to us always,\" her mother said at the event.\\nAround the same time, Agam Berger\\'s twin sister Lee Yam, enrolled in Israeli military officer school after delaying it partly because of the situation with her sister. Another sibling, Bar, will turn 18 in February and soon join the military, too.\\nOf the original 251 hostages, more than 100 were freed during the Israeli-Hamas cease-fire in November in exchange for the release of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel. Eight have been rescued by Israeli forces.\\nIsraeli troops mistakenly killed three Israeli hostages who escaped Hamas captivity in Gaza in December. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli health officials said six hostages whose bodies were located on Aug. 31 in a Hamas tunnel in Gaza were shot multiple times at close range including in the head.\\nIn addition to the tens of thousands of Palestinians killed by Israel\\'s military since the start of the war, the war has displaced the majority of Gaza\\'s 2.3 million people.\\nIsrael has fought multiple wars with Hamas and other Palestinian militant groups as well as coalitions of Arab-nation forces as part of an Israeli-Palestinian conflict that\\'s one of the longest running in modern history. At the center of this conflict is a dispute over territory, security, Israel\\'s right to exist and Palestinian rights and self-governance.\\nBut the most recent war, the bloodiest in their shared history, began when Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7.\\n\"Every event is hard. The 100th day. The 150th day. The 200th day. You can\\'t believe the days are passing by and they are still there. We have a lot of moments that are very, very hard,\" Shlomi Berger said.\\nSome solace in returning to work\\nIn the early days of Agam Berger\\'s captivity, her parents, who are both engineers, adopted very different approaches to dealing with the ordeal. Shlomi Berger found some solace in quickly returning to work as he tried to keep his mind free from speculating about how his daughter was being treated in captivity.\\nHe attended meeting after meeting with senior Israeli officials, the prime minister and members of his security and war Cabinet. He met regularly, and still does, with families of other hostages.\\nHe traveled to the U.S. to lobby members of Congress to pressure the Biden administration to \"do more.\"\\nMeirav Berger rarely left the house, refused to read the news or watch the Hamas video of her daughter. She was overcome with sadness, feelings of powerlessness and would spend hours weeping.\\n\"I was very afraid for her in those early months,\" Shlomi Berger said of his wife.\\n\"I told her, \\'You can\\'t just put your hands on your ears and say I don\\'t hear anything. I don\\'t want to see anything.\\'\"\\nIn recent months Meirav Berger has gotten that message. She now fills her day with going to appointments where there\\'s an opportunity to speak about her daughter so she is not forgotten.\\n\"I realized I needed to take action,\" she said. \"To talk about Agam and spread her message, which is about love.\"\\nIn mid-September she flew to Budapest, Hungary, so she could say some prayers for Agam − \"to defend her\" from her captors, she said − at the burial place of a prominent Jewish rabbi from the 19th century.\\nA few weeks before that, she and her husband did something they had not done in nearly a year.\\nThey did something together as a couple.\\nThey went to the beach at sat alone for several hours.\\n\"After the murder of the six hostages I got a point where I couldn\\'t breathe. I needed to clear my head. When I got in the water it felt like going to the mikvah,\" she said, referring to the Jewish ritual bath.\\n\"I felt pure again.\"\\n\\'Each one stands − and doesn\\'t move\\'\\nFridays, generally speaking, are a good day for Shlomi Berger.\\nHe goes to the synagogue in his apartment building to mark the start of Shabbat, the Jewish Sabbath that takes place from sunset on Friday to sunset on Saturday. The neighbors are there. He\\'s with his family.\\nThey sit together. Eat together. Converse together. There are few distractions.\\n\"This is a time that holds me,\" he said.\\nUnlike many other hostage families, Agam Berger\\'s parents have not felt particularly compelled to attend regular demonstrations and large-scale protests in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and other cities aimed at pressuring Netanyahu to make a deal with Hamas, and at forcing his resignation.\\nThey have no ready explanation for this. Shlomi Berger said he found it hard to accept that not all of Israel was on the streets protesting day and night for the release of the hostages. He prefers to stay at home.\\nHe described the Israel-Hamas cease-fire and hostage negotiation efforts as like \"two mountains.\"\\n\"Each one stands − and doesn\\'t move.\"\\nHe said the news of the six hostages who appeared to be executed at close range has made many hostage families realize that \"we really are running out of time to save them\" and that death, for his daughter, can come at any time.\\nA dozen or so flights up from his building\\'s synagogue, in his daughter\\'s room, there are books, cards, drawings and various tokens that have been sent to his family. They lay propped on her bed. Some of his daughter\\'s friends have written well-wishes and personal notes on the walls in her room. For a year they have been accumulating.\\nBut he doesn\\'t like to go in there either. Like listening to her play violin, he finds it unbearable.\\nHis daughter, he said, is like many other girls her age. She\\'s into \"having fun,\" going out with friends to get their hair and nails done. She likes to travel. She loves the beach. She\\'s got a big heart, he said.\\nHe hopes none of that has changed.',\n",

He\\'d written \"City Lights\" in 1958 for Ray Price and \"Once A Day\" for Connie Smith in 1964, alongside having success with the hits \"Po\\' Folks,\" \"Mama Sang a Song\" and \"Still,\" among many.\\nKristofferson was a folk-adoring Rhodes Scholar, representing a different side of the same coin as Anderson, a pop-aimed country lover and collegiate journalism student.\\n\"Kris made me, Bobby Braddock and Harlan Howard — all of us who (worked in Nashville before he arrived) — better songwriters by showing us the potential for country\\'s industry that we didn\\'t realize was there and showing us how to stretch our boundaries to get there by listening to what he said and wrote,\" Anderson added.\\n\\'What a line — why didn\\'t I think of that?\\'\\nAnderson\\'s recalling of Kristofferson\\'s songwriting is fascinating in that he offers recollections as a friendly competitor of his instead of someone contemplating songs in their legacy.\\nHe discusses \"Me and Bobby McGee\" as not being Janis Joplin\\'s only No. 1 single, posthumously, in 1971. Instead, it\\'s in its early era 18 months prior as a summer 1969 single for Nashville favorite Roger Miller. \"For The Good Times\" isn\\'t so much the song it became for Al Green, but rather the country No. 1 it was for Ray Price, who cut \"City Lights\" by Anderson a dozen years prior.\\n\"Artists found things in Kris\\' songs that spoke to them and everyone else (universally). The Ray Price that sang \\'For The Good Times\\' sounded nothing like the Ray Price who sang \\'City Lights,\\'\" jokes Anderson.\\nTo the Hall of Famer, Price\\'s evolution from a \"thin, hard country\" vocalist to a \"rich, baritone soul\" singer spoke to the lengths singers would go to find themselves in the words of songs like \"Lovin\\' Her Was Easier (than Anything I\\'ll Ever Do Again).\" The 1970-written song was released by Kristofferson and Miller, Tompall Glaser, Waylon Jennings and Mark Chestnutt.\\nHe references that the song stands out to him as impressively being one that, because it only has two chords dominating its composition, has to place the onus of its connectivity on an \"astounding lyrical message and feel.\"\\n\"You\\'re not ashamed to be a woman / She\\'s not afraid to be a friend,\" Anderson says during the call, quoting Kristofferson\\'s words.\\n\"Golly Moses, goodness gracious, what a line — why didn\\'t I think of that?\"\\nKristofferson\\'s impact on legendary songwriters\\nRegarding songwriters Anderson mentioned earlier, being driven by having a wordsmith like Kristofferson in their creative midst certainly bore impacts on, similar to Anderson, the careers of Bobby Braddock and Harlan Howard.\\nBobby Braddock wrote No. 1 hits in five decades.\\nNotably, Tammy Wynette\\'s \"D-I-V-O-R-C-E\" in 1968, 1976\\'s \"Golden Ring\" for Wynette and George Jones, \"The Possum \"\\'s \"He Stopped Loving Her Today\" in 1980 and Tracy Lawrence\\'s \"Time Marches On\" from 1996 bear similarities to the deceptively plainspoken intellect familiar to Kristofferson\\'s work.\\nAbout the latter, in a 2019 interview, Braddock noted the following about the universal power of Lawrence\\'s hit:\\n\"Well, within two minutes and 40 seconds, it\\'s the story of someone\\'s life and their observations and the changes around them...\\' The south moves north and north moves south; a star is born, a star burns out. The only thing that stays the same is everything changes, everything changes.\\'\"\\nInsofar as Howard, he\\'s notable in that one in roughly every 40 songs he penned (of the over 4,000 in his career) was a top-10 hit and for having as many as 15 of his own songs simultaneously placed in country\\'s Top 40. As well, he\\'s the artisan credited with first saying the quote that country music is \"three chords and the truth.\"\\nStarting with his 1959 No. 1 \"Heartaches By The Number\" for Ray Price and including Johnny Cash\\'s \"Busted,\" Patsy Cline\\'s \"I Fall To Pieces,\" Joe SImon\\'s \"The Chokin\\' Kind,\" The Judds\\' \"Why Not Me\" and Patty Loveless\\' Blame It on Your Heart,\" he achieved four legendary decades in Music City.\\nUpon his 2002 passing, Kristofferson told the Los Angeles Times that Howard was a heroic songwriter who wrote \"direct, simple and from the heart.\"\\nHoward \"brought an edge to country and created much of its lexicon,\" as a \"pre-Dylan\" who \"threw acid into the mix,\" added Rodney Crowell. \"\\'I\\'ve got heartaches by the numbers and troubles by the score\\' was poetry.\"\\nIn that vein, Kristofferson\\'s offered as a conduit from Nashville\\'s past and present to its future.\\n\\'He made it better...\\'\\n\"Kris was the drum major who led the parade for all of that,\" says Anderson regarding Kristofferson\\'s role in ushering in country\\'s crossover sensibilities.\\nBy 1971, he was a Country Music Association award-winning songwriter who had penned a No. 1 song for a rock artist. By 1976, he was a Golden Globe Award-winning actor starring alongside Barbra Streisand in \"A Star is Born.\" By 1985, he\\'d paired with Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson as the Highwaymen supergroup.\\nFrom traditional to countrypolitan, adult-contemporary pop to neo-traditional through into Americana, Kristofferson, in many ways, served as much as a preservationist of the genre\\'s traditions as a guidepost of what country\\'s legacy of traditions could next achieve.\\n\"When all of us (in country\\'s industry) realized what he was doing, we also realized he was the only person who could accomplish those things and take (the country music industry) to a whole new level,\" offered Anderson.\\n\"Kris had a natural ability to write intelligently crafted songs embodying a blend of intelligence and sensitivity that were as country and soulful as Hank Williams singing \\'I\\'m So Lonesome I Could Cry,\\' but could appeal to pop and rock ears like (1971 top-10 Billboard Hot 100 hit) \\'Help Me Make It Through The Night.\\'\"\\nAnderson answers with his briefest, most potent response when asked to comment on the overall value of Kristofferson\\'s art, humanity and legacy to evolving country\\'s culture, genre and industry.',\n",

       "   'excerpt': 'Texas-native Hugh Prestwood wrote hit songs for Judy Collins, Trisha Yearwood, Randy Travis and many more.',\n",
       "   'summary': 'Hugh Prestwood, an El Paso, Texas, native and Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame-inducted wordsmith, died on Sept. 22 following a stroke. He was 82.\\nThe scholarly lyricist\\'s hits set a standard for pop-aimed country balladry for two decades. Of note, a span that included Judy Collins\\' 1978-released \"Hard Time for Lovers\" and Trisha Yearwood\\'s 1993 Nashville Songwriters Association\\'s Song of the Year and Emmy winner \"The Song Remembers When\" marked the pinnacle of his craft.\\nA peerless Nashville legacy\\n\"Being creative and getting a response from my songs is very gratifying,\" Prestwood said in a 2018 interview.\\nThe instant gratification of watching an idea develop into art and art turn into musical expression drove his passion for engaging in what he described as a \"labor of love\" inspired most often by 1970s Los Angeles-based folk-rock icons like Jackson Browne, the Eagles, Joni Mitchell and James Taylor.\\nPrestwood\\'s folk-meets-country stylings leaned in an adult-contemporary direction that benefitted artists, including torch song stylists like Crystal Gayle (1983\\'s \"Sound of Goodbye\"), neo-traditionalists like Randy Travis (1989\\'s \"Hard Rock Bottom of Your Heart\"), country-to-pop radio stalwarts Shenandoah, and traditionalists like Alison Krauss (1999\\'s \"Ghost in This House\").\\nHis work throughout the 1980s earned him three Grammy nominations and a victory for BMI\\'s Song of the Year with Travis\\' \"Hard Rock Bottom of Your Heart.\" As well, throughout his career, he achieved hits with two-dozen artists, including Country Music Hall of Famers, Rock & Roll Hall of Famers, Grammy winners and Grand Ole Opry members, including Anne Murray, Conway Twitty, the Judds, Kathy Mattea, Shelby Lynne, John Conlee, Jimmy Buffett, Jerry Douglas, James Taylor, Gene Watson, Barbara Mandrell, Sammy Kershaw, Lee Greenwood, Don Williams, and Tanya Tucker.\\nFolk-defined roots\\nAfter graduating from the University of Texas at El Paso, Prestwood\\'s childhood love of music and playing guitar superseded his love of being an elementary school teacher. That led him from moonlighting as a songwriter to uprooting his life wholesale and moving to New York\\'s Greenwich Village in 1972 to pursue the craft.\\nFive years later, Judy Collins, whose work he admired, cut \"Hard Time for Lovers.\" By the early 1980s, the surge of Los Angeles folkies reviving their careers in Music City combined well with the work of artists like Crystal Gayle, whose softer, adult contemporary country pop played well with songs arranged with those stylings. Alongside R&B-influenced producers like Brent Maher and acts like the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, achieving a decade\\'s worth of Top 10 hits allowed Prestwood\\'s works to earn significant reach and success.\\nNotable for his work, Prestwood was often a solo songwriter when co-writing was on the rise in Nashville. He was also fond of remaining an outsider to country\\'s hub, moving to Greenport, New York, a fishing community near Long Island, in 1983. While living there, he taught advanced songwriting at Manhattan\\'s New School for two decades.\\nBy 1987, he married photographer Judy Ahrens, who remained his wife for 37 years.\\nPrestwood\\'s work finds solo success, revived renown\\nBy the turn of the 21st century, Prestwood began to pursue his own career aspirations.\\nIn 1999, he self-released \"Ghost in This House.\" \"Fate of Fireflies,\" his second self-produced album, was released in 2005. In 2007, Skyline Music Publishing released his CD, \"All the Way On,\" his first major studio album.\\nFour decades after their initial success, Collins teamed up with Prestwood again in 2016 to release his fourth album, \"I Used To Be the Real Me,\" on her Wild Flower Records.\\nIn 2020, the English recording artist Rumer released an album of Prestwood\\'s material, \"Nashville Tears: The Songs of Hugh Prestwood.\"\\nIn a 2020 press statement, Rumer said she was looking for \"lost gems\" while based in the American South and stumbled upon Prestwood\\'s catalog.\\nRuminations on mortality and nostalgia blend well with nature-defined metaphors as, in a note to the timelessness of the magic of his songwriting when paired with acoustic, soulful compositions, Mojo magazine said that Rumer\\'s ability to find \"the perfect spot in her vocal range to sit and max out the nostalgic melancholy\" of \"heart-searching ballads\" was noteworthy.\\n\\'We\\'re all lucky that Hugh decided to be a writer\\'\\nUpon hearing of Prestwood\\'s death, Yearwood offered the following statement via social media:\\n\"Hugh Prestwood was a poet. \\'The Song Remembers When\\' is one of the greatest songs ever written, and I\\'m the lucky girl who got to sing it. It paints the beautiful picture of the power of music. We\\'re all lucky that Hugh decided to be a writer. I will miss his voice.\"\\nIn 2022, Prestwood moved to his wife\\'s family\\'s hometown of Lincoln, Nebraska.She survives him, along with a son Brian Prestwood (wife Lori, of Fort Worth, Texas, their children, Brannon of Fort Worth, son Brett of Houston); daughter Jennifer Bustillos (husband Randy, children Andrew and Adyson, all of Fort Worth); sister-in-law Connie Roberts (husband Ron), of Merriam, Kansas; sister-in-law Cindy Honnens (husband Stuart) of Lincoln; and many nieces and nephews. He was preceded in death by his mother, Nadine Prestwood, father, Hugh Prestwood Sr.; and sister, Marvyn Luckett.\\nA celebration of life is being planned. In lieu of flowers, a donation toward Prestwood\\'s medical expenses is requested via Venmo to @Judy-Ahrens-5.',\n",

       "   'excerpt': 'No longtime UT fan will forget the historical victory over the Razorbacks. But there have been other memorable games.',\n",
       "   'summary': \"For Tennessee, Arkansas is the football rivalry that almost took off.\\nWhen the Razorbacks joined the SEC in 1992, Tennessee-Arkansas was a border war and natural match.\\nAnd for 11 years, 1992-2002, the series produced meaningful Saturdays. Then the schedule format changed. Then more expansion. Now, the Razorbacks are an afterthought to the Vols. And vice versa.\\nThis Saturday, Arkansas matters again. Tennessee will try to snap a three-game losing streak to the Razorbacks. Erik Ainge was the last Vol QB to beat Arkansas. Think about that.\\nThe paramount date is Nov. 14, 1998. I mention Clint Stoerner. You fill in the details.\\nBut there have been other significant battles. Here are five of them.\\n1992: The Razorbacks' first trip to Neyland Stadium found Tennessee – team and fan base – in fraught times.\\nAfter Johnny Majors had heart surgery before the season, interim coach Phillip Fulmer guided the Vols to rousing wins over Georgia and Florida, making him wildly popular. Majors' unanticipated return after the Florida win created tension. Still, wins over Cincinnati and LSU followed and the Vols were 5-0 and ranked No. 4 when Arkansas arrived.\\nA Heath Shuler touchdown provided a comfortable 24-16 margin with 10:28 to play. Then things fell apart. Arkansas returned a punt for a touchdown with 2:28 left – and recovered the onside kickoff.\\nWith two seconds on the clock, Todd Wright hit a 41-yard field goal. The Razorbacks had the upset, 25-24.\\nThe Vols had a mess. Losses to Alabama and South Carolina followed, after which UT forced Majors to announce his resignation on Nov. 13.\\n1997: Peyton Manning's last chance to win an SEC title was tested in Little Rock.\\nArkansas led 22-17 early in the fourth quarter, but Manning found Marcus Nash for a TD for a 23-22 lead. A two-point try failed.\\nThe outcome was still in doubt when Arkansas was forced to punt with under 5 minutes to play. UT's Eric Brown blocked the punt and recovered at the Razorback 18. Two plays later, Jamal Lewis scored for a 30-22 lead.\\nThat stood up, and after wins over Kentucky and Vandy, the Vols went to Atlanta and beat Auburn for the SEC title.\\n1999: The Fulmer era peaked in the 1998 national title. A year later, an early loss to Florida hurt but six straight wins put UT back in the title hunt.\\nOn Nov. 13 in Fayetteville, No. 3 Tennessee led 24-14 in the third quarter. All good.\\nBut QB Stoerner got his revenge for '98, burning the Vols with two TD passes to claim a 28-24 lead with 3:44 to play. UT's final four possessions were a fumble, two punts and a fourth-down incomplete pass.\\nNo repeat.\\n2001: The great 9/11-postponed Dec. 1 victory at Florida to clinch the SEC East mattered only because the Vols found a way to win their SEC opener at Arkansas.\\nLiterally, a dark and stormy night. The game was delayed twice by lightning. But UT's offense had no electricity. Arkansas led 3-0 entering the fourth quarter.\\nAn Alex Walls field goal tied it. Finally, Casey Clausen hit Kelley Washington for a 30-yard gain to the Arkansas 16. From there, Walls gave UT a 6-3 lead with 3:52 left.\\nAn interception got the ball back and, with 59 ticks left on the clock, Travis Stephens – on his 41 st carry of the night – scored the game's only touchdown for a 13-3 win.\\n2002: The longest game in Tennessee history. Four hours, nine seconds. Six overtimes.\\nThat the Vols blew a 17-3 in the fourth quarter was forgotten by the time Casey Clausen hit Jason Witten with a 25-yard touchdown in the sixth overtime to salvage a 41-38 win.\\nBackup kicker Phillip Newman had his career highlight, converting field goals in the first and second overtimes. Troy Fleming recovered a Jabari Davis fumble in the end zone for a touchdown in the fifth overtime. What a night.\",\n",

       "   'summary': \"Shaurya Desai, of Gallatin High School, has been named as The Tennessean's Freshman Student of the Week after an extended nomination period brought on by a technical error.\\nThe newspaper received seven nominations in the category, and Desai walked away with 47.3% of the vote to secure top honors.\\nNominated by Ninth Grade School Counselor Kelly Brewer, Desai is described as an outstanding student. He is currently taking Honors and AP classes while participating on the Academic Team, Brewer said, noting that he's also involved with the Foreign Language Club, JROTC's Raiders and Marksmanship program.\\nThe Tennessean's Student of the Week initiative is a weekly program that runs throughout the school year. Students are nominated for the honor by principals, guidance counselors or other staffers at their schools. They're then put into an online poll, where readers have the chance to vote and determine who wins.\\nDue to fall break taking place in school districts across Middle Tennessee, the newspaper will be pausing the program until the week of Oct. 21. Look for new students and new polls to return at that time.\\nIn the meantime, here were the other six freshman who were nominated for this week's poll and what their schools wrote about them:\\nAddison Beattie, Beech High School\\nAddison is on the Freshman and Junior Varsity soccer team, student council, participates in choir, in honors classes, and plans to also participate in track. Her classmates and teachers acknowledge how she is kind to her peers and goes out her way to support school spirit by attending football games and/or participates in leadership opportunities on campus. She's an outstanding Buc all around!\\nBailey Sinks, Montgomery Central High School\\nBailey is always engaged, participates in class, has great attendance and has a positive attitude. Her World History teacher says, 'Bailey makes my class better!'\\nCarlana Stewart, White House Heritage High School\\nCarlana originally entered her Algebra 1 class unsure of math. Even though she's not the biggest fan of the subject, she still shows a wonderfully positive attitude, tremendous sense determination and perseverance. She is a breath of fresh air in her math class and encourages those around her to do/be the same as well.\\nDevin Smith, Montgomery Central High School\\nDevin is a hard worker, has a great attitude, is very relaxed and easy to get along with. He is kind and courteous to adults and students alike. Devin also helps his peers when he can, especially during structured intervention.\\nHudson Maddox, James Lawson High School\\nHudson has been through a lot as a freshman but still shows up with a can-do attitude. He suffered a cardiac event at school in mid-August. He has since returned to school and picked up as if nothing else happened! He continues to successfully maintain his schoolwork and friendships!\\nLaPromise Davis, James Lawson High School\\nLaPromise is an outstanding student-athlete, excelling in soccer, basketball and track. She even made it to the state finals last track season, showcasing her dedication and talent. In addition to her athletic achievements, LaPromise has made significant contributions through community service, balancing her busy schedule with a strong commitment to helping others. She exemplifies leadership, hard work and dedication both on and off the field.\",\n",

Amy Klobuchar in Minnesota. \\'There were no \\'good guys\\' in that war. The controlling interests had a jump ball. If you look closely, you see the link between liberalism and communism in the Allied forces.\\'\\nBacklash quickly ensued after the post was resurfaced by Heartland Signal. It comes as the Republican White lags behind in polls against the Democratic Sen. Klobuchar. One recent poll from Minnesota Star Tribune/MPR News/KARE shows Klobuchar with an 11-point lead over White.\\nWhite replied to the resurfaced tweet on X, decrying the \"reconstruction of our global economy\" after World War II. \"It\\'s embarrassing to see how many of you liberals have become pro war and pro crony capitalism,\" he said.\\nNazi Germany and its collaborators killed more than 6 million Jewish people during WWII.\\nWhite\\'s campaign did not immediately reply to USA TODAY\\'s request for comment.\\nWho is Royce White?\\nA Minnesota native, White is making another attempt at a political career. In 2022, he failed to advance past the Republican primary for the Minnesota District 5 House of Representatives Seat.\\nThis isn\\'t the first controversy White has been involved in, as reported by the St. Cloud Times, part of the USA TODAY Network. He has also come under fire for allegedly using campaign funds at a strip club, admitted to being transphobic and has told voters in the state that he is further right than former President Donald Trump.\\nWhite is a former professional basketball player who played a total of three games in the NBA for the Sacramento Kings.\\nWhite was also the 16th overall pick of the 2012 NBA Draft being drafted by the Houston Rockets after attending Iowa State for college.\\nHe later played in the Big 3 league after being selected first overall.',\n",

       "   'summary': \"Good morning!\\nTuesday evening, the two candidates for vice president of the United States squared off in what will likely be their only debate before the Nov. 5 election.\\nI'm no Republican strategist, but I'd be willing to bet that Sen. JD Vance was given explicit instructions to re-galvanize factions of the right who may be growing weary of Trump's antics — or who may be concerned that others are.\\nAnd by this metric alone, Vance's performance was a resounding success. Vance sounded polished and smart and, well, human.\\nTennessean readers agreed. In a poll on our site, we tracked real-time impressions of the debate, and with a 55 to 45% margin, Vance was named the winner. Notably, however, 62% of readers said the debate didn't change their overall opinions.\\nIndeed, for as likeable and sincere and not Trump as Vance appeared, he is still running with Trump and would be working for Trump if elected. This was made clear as the debate neared its culmination and the issue of Trump's refusal to acknowledge the results of the 2020 was raised.\\nIt's an important issue to discuss, as Americans on both sides of the political aisle — and certainly in between — question the future of our democracy. Polarization is at an all-time high, breeding anger, mistrust, general pessimism.\\nYet despite this, and despite the fact that all 50 states certified the 2020 election, Vance refused to answer Gov. Tim Walz's question of whether Trump was, in fact, defeated.\\n'Tim,' Vance replied, 'I'm focused on the future.'\\nIn my column this week, I wrote about this 'damning non-answer' and what I think it says about the real results of the debate.\\nUltimately, Vance's response was a stark reminder:\\nVance isn't running for president. Trump is.\\nWhat else should you read this weekend?\\nThere are multiple reports detailing the growth of Nashville, from an influx of new residents to its tourism boom. Less has been written, however, about how uneven this growth has been. In a feature for The Tennessean's business page, reporter Hadley Hitson wrote about the survival struggles of Nashville's Black-owned businesses, as well as new initiatives designed to offer support.\\nFor The Commercial Appeal, Dr. Reverand J. Lawrence Turner, senior pastor of Memphis's Mississippi Boulevard Christian Church, penned a guest column urging Memphians to vote in the coming election—paying particular attention to local races.\\n'Certainly, the top of the ticket matters,' he wrote. 'But the bottom of the ticket, which too often gets ignored, matters just as much. Down the ballot is where we all have to live, no matter who is calling the shots in Congress.'\\nFinally, an update on the trial of the former Memphis police officers charged in the January 2023 killing of Tyre Nichols: After five hours of deliberation, the verdict for three of the officers was mixed. One officer, Demetrius Haley, was found guilty on all counts, while the two other officers were found guilty of witness tampering.\\nAs always, it's a pleasure to be in your inbox, and if we haven't yet connected, I'd love to hear from you!\\nUntil next week…\",\n",

What prosecutors are reviewing and determining based on the new evidence is whether or not the findings would have led to the jury coming to a \"different conclusion,\" according to the DA.\\n\"I don\\'t think there is any question in this case that the young men, one was 19 and the other was 21 at the time, murdered their parents,\" Gascón said.\\nWhat is the new evidence in the Menendez brothers case?\\nThe new evidence Gascón and his office will review includes a photocopied letter that one of the brothers allegedly sent to another family member about him being the victim of molestation.\\nProsecutors were also given evidence by one of the brothers\\' attorneys alleging that he had been molested by his father, according to Gascón, who added that none of the claims brought forth by the defense have been confirmed. The DA did not specify which brother claimed they were molested.\\n\"We are not, at this point, ready to say that we either believe or do not believe that information,\" the DA said. \"But we\\'re here to tell you because we have a moral and ethical obligation to review what is being presented to us and make a determination.\"\\nIf the brothers are resentenced, then Erik Menendez, 53, and Lyle Menendez, 56, could \"walk out\" of prison after already serving 35 years for their parents\\' murders, Gascón said. The other possibilities include the brothers receiving a lesser sentence and even a new trial, the DA added.\\nBoth brothers were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in 1996.\\nA hearing regarding the new evidence is set for Nov. 29, according to Gascón.\\n\\'There are men also that are victimized\\'\\nLos Angeles prosecutors decided to review the new evidence to recognize further that \"both men and woman can be victims of sexual assault,\" Gascón said.\\n\"Most of the victims are usually young women, but there are men also that are victimized,\" according to the DA.\\nGascón also mentioned the 100-plus allegations made against hip-hop mogul Sean \"Diddy\" Combs, which include accusations of sexual assault against young boys and men.\\n\"We have seen over and over again when both young boys and young girls are molested,\" the DA said.\\n\\'Appeal for Menendez Brothers\\' Change.org petition\\nA Change.org petition titled \" Appeal for Menendez Brothers\" has over 365,000 signatures and aims to get a new trial, a reduced sentence, or another equitable remedy for Erik and Lyle Menendez.\\n\"The Menendez trial is a very famous and controversial case but unfortunately also very understanding and important in the perspective of someone whose been sexually abused as a child their self,\" the petition\\'s organizer, Micailla Beachman, wrote on the Change.org page.\\n\"The original trial contained information, evidence and testimonies that caused a mistrial, of which i firmly believe was and is the truth. The second trial removed that defense evidence in ignorance of child sexual abuse statistics & lack of humaneness making all given information useless in the final prosecution.\"\\nThe petition\\'s goal is 500,000 signatures, according to the Change.org page.\\n\"Even if (you\\'re) unfamiliar with their case, do the research if it interests you & if not at least understand everyone deserves a second shot at life, in their situation this would be their first real shot at life in freedom, not only from prison but from their inner fears, their past burdens and present regrets, \"Beachman wrote. \"A change in justice was made for a reason, why not retry the case with the new bill?\\nKim Kardashian, others support the Menendez brothers\\' release\\nIn addition to Beachman and the thousands who have signed the petition, Kim Kardashian also called for the brothers\\' release in a personal essay shared exclusively with NBC News.\\n\"We are all products of our experiences. They shape who we were, who we are, and who we will be. Physiologically and psychologically, time changes us, and I doubt anyone would claim to be the same person they were at 18,\" the Skims founder and billionaire beauty mogul wrote. \"Twenty-four family members, including their parents\\' siblings, have released statements fully supporting Lyle and Erik.\"\\nKardashian had recently visited the prison where the Menendez brothers were housed, along with Ryan Murphy\\'s \"Monsters\" star Cooper Koch, who plays Erik in the second season of the Netflix miniseries, Variety reported on Sept. 21.\\n\"Can anyone honestly deny that the justice system would have treated the Menendez sisters more leniently,\" Kardashian said, noting that at the time \"there were virtually no systems in place to support survivors, and public awareness of the trauma of male sexual abuse was minimal, often clouded by preconceived judgments and homophobia.\"',\n",

       "   'summary': 'Goals and policy recommendations from Imagine Nashville, the 10-year vision plan guided by surveys of more than 10,000 residents, were released Friday.\\nImagine Nashville co-chair Dr. Alex Jahangir said the report was designed to get Nashville back to its \"roots\" and \"bring the community together around a set of driving priorities that enable Nashville to continue to prosper but with an eye to making sure all Nashvillians feel they belong and can thrive here.\\'\\nThe report identified a sense of belonging as a key value for residents and found that some groups felt that sense was at risk.\\n\"That\\'s long been a part of the secret sauce,\" Imagine Nashville co-chair the Rev. John Faison Sr. said at a Friday news conference. \"But increasingly ... that might be slipping away.\"\\nThe study found the No. 1 determinant of residents\\' sense of belonging was their income. According to the report, 57% of low income families in Nashville — a sizable portion, considering 47% of Nashvillians qualify as low-income, the report states — feel excluded from the benefits of living in Nashville. Additionally, 48% of LGBTQ+ Nashvillians and 45% of residents aged 65 or older said they lack a sense of belonging.\\nThe 31-page report outlines four key priorities for the city\\'s next decade: ensuring all residents have stronger pathways to earning a higher standard of living, improving transit options, boosting the city\\'s affordable housing stock and maintaining each neighborhood\\'s distinct character.\\nMayor Freddie O\\'Connell on Friday morning called the report\\'s results reassuring and said they reinforced what his office has done in the first year of his term.\\n\\'After a campaign built on making it easier for Nashvillians to stay and thrive here, we\\'ve worked through the first year of the administration to improve quality of life and make Nashville more affordable,\" O\\'Connell said in a news release. \"Those principles align with what so many Nashvillians told us through Imagine Nashville. We all desire a more connected city that leaves each of us certain that we belong and can succeed here.\"\\nAlong with the four priorities are goals for 2035, which included increasing the share of what the report called \"good and promising\" jobs in the city from 44% to 60%, getting 20% of residents to commute to work by means other than car, producing and preserving at least 50,000 affordable housing units and having all neighborhoods implement \"neighborhood improvement plans\" created in line with the report.',\n",

       "   'summary': \"Welcome to SEC Unfiltered, the USA TODAY NETWORK's newsletter on SEC sports. Look for this newsletter in your inbox Monday through Friday. Today, national college football columnist Blake Toppmeyer takes over:\\nOne month into the season, a few developments surprised me within the SEC. Here's a rundown of what caught me a little off-guard:\\n1. Georgia's offense is riddled with imperfections. The Bulldogs ' offensive line doesn't control the line of scrimmage. Offensive coordinator Mike Bobo ignores his run game. The wide receivers don't consistently gain separation. And quarterback Carson Beck regressed. Rough month for Georgia's offense.\\n2. South Carolina is a team you don't want to play. I had the Gamecocks pegged near the SEC's cellar, but after beating Kentucky and pushing LSU to the brink, they're playing better than I expected. Their defensive front sets the tone, and Ole Miss will be on upset alert Saturday.\\n3. Tennessee's defense looks dominant. The Vols lead the SEC in total defense, and opponents haven't been able to exploit their overhauled secondary. Grain of salt: Tennessee hasn't faced a good offense yet. Still, I wouldn't have believed Tennessee would be allowing only 125 passing yards per game.\\n4. Ole Miss suffered a loss. The Rebels' schedule looked all set for them to cruise to a 6-0 start. Kentucky had other ideas.\\n5. Florida really stinks. I thought Billy Napier had Florida's roster in its best shape since his arrival. Figured Florida's loaded schedule meant a record of no better than 6-6, but I thought, record aside, the product would be improved. That's not been the case, especially on defense. If the Gators lose to UCF on Saturday, finishing 2-10 is in play. Regardless, they'll be in need of a new coach soon.\",\n",

       "   'summary': 'Legislative Democrats condemned a new attack ad mailed out in House District 75 that features photos of Democratic candidate Allie Phillips \\' 7-year-old daughter, images of a minor child scraped from Phillips\\' social media and shared without parental permission.\\nThe direct mailer features several photos of a young child attending an event with a performer dressed in drag. The girl\\'s face is blurred, but the mailer identifies it as Phillips\\' daughter.\\nDemocrats condemned the Tennessee Republican Party, which paid for the mailer, for considering \"families fair game\" in a heated legislative race. The Republican Party responded in kind, saying it \"will not apologize for protecting minors\" from \"sexualized drag shows,\" though there\\'s no evidence included on the mailer that suggests the event content was sexual in nature.\\nThe ad doesn\\'t feature any photos of the candidate herself nor does it explicitly mention her opponent, incumbent Rep. J eff Burkhart, R-Clarksville. It instead says Philips \"doesn\\'t represent Clarksville\\'s values\" and states Phillips \"exposed\" her daughter to a drag performance.\\nOn Thursday, Phillips issued a statement on social media calling it a \"piece of hateful mail\" sent out by the Tennessee Republican Party. Phillips said she stands for Tennessee values — including \"family, kindness, inclusion and diversity.\"\\n\"Attack me, attack my policies, make up stories about me, do your absolute worst when it comes to trying to sway voters aware from me,\" Phillips said. \"But do not come after my baby.\"\\nHouse Democratic Caucus Chair John Ray Clemmons, D-Nashville, slammed the ad \"targeting\" Phillips\\' family and minor child.\\n\"We have all seen enough from these folks to know they have little to no class, but targeting an innocent, young child is a new low — even for them. These types of shameful attempts to save their losing candidates are more appropriate for an outhouse, not the state House,\" Clemmons said. \"I\\'d caution Scott Golden and my Republican colleagues from continuing to consider families fair game.\"\\nIn response to Tennessean questions, Golden defended the ad, saying the images were pulled \"directly from the candidate\\'s TikTok account that she proudly pushed throughout her social media.\\n\"Tennessee Republicans will not apologize for protecting minors whether it is in girls\\' sports, girls\\' locker rooms, unnecessary gender surgeries, or sexualized drag shows,\" Golden said. \"We know that Allie Phillips is being funded by out of state activists with an extreme woke agenda and we believe the voters of Clarksville need to aware before they cast their vote.\"\\nDemocrats on Thursday bristled at the argument a minor child should be fair game in a political attack campaign, particularly given a recent string of legislation out of the legislative Republican supermajority seemingly passed under the guise of protecting the parental right to consent to or deny a variety of actions involving minor children.\\nGolden did not respond to a follow-up inquiry from The Tennessean regarding the potential contradiction of using images of a child without parental consent in a campaign aimed at \"protecting minors.\"\\nIn a separate email, TNGOP treasurer Shannon Haynes initially declined to comment or answer Tennessean questions regarding who approved the ad\\'s contents. Haynes said they\\'d answer in \"court,\" saying a lawsuit had been filed, though Phillips\\' team denied taking any legal action as of Thursday.\\nIt\\'s possible Haynes confused the Phillips ad controversy with one involving another competitive district. Knox County candidate Bryan Goldberg this week sued the state GOP, House Republican Caucus, Rep. Elaine Davis and a political advertising firm over a website claiming he didn\\'t pay his property taxes on time.\\nKnox News confirmed Knox County canceled a late property tax payment fee against the Goldbergs after they showed proof their proprety tax check mailed to the Knox County Trustee\\'s office had been stolen and cashed in another state.\\nTennessee Supreme Court hears redistricting arguments\\nThe Tennessee Supreme Court on Thursday heard arguments in a lingering redistricting case related to new House and Senate maps drawn by legislative Republicans in 2022.\\nBoth sides in the case appealed a split lower court ruling last year, which sided with Tennessee in regards to the House map but struck down the Senate map. The three-judge panel ruled 2-1 that the Senate map violated the state Constitution\\'s requirement that districts be numbered consecutively, which determines which years those seats are on the ballot.\\nLast December, the lower court had ordered the General Assembly to redraw the Senate map before the state Supreme Court stepped in earlier this year, allowing the state to hold 2024 elections under the contested map.\\nIt was the second time the state Supreme Court overruled a local judicial panel to allow Tennessee to move forward with the Senate map, after the high court in 2022 struck down a preliminary injunction over the map.\\nThree Tennessee voters, supported by the Tennessee Democratic Party, sued over the Republican-backed redistricting plan, alleging the GOP ignored and violated constitutional provisions when it drew House and Senate maps that further entrenched the Republican supermajority.\\nTennessee has argued the plaintiffs have no standing to sue and have not been legally harmed by the maps.\\nLawmakers hold hearing on curtailing wetlands protections\\nA panel of lawmakers heard testimony Thursday on a proposal to curtail protections for about 65% of wetlands in Tennessee – a proposal that is likely to come back during next year\\'s legislative session.\\nFollowing the U.S. Supreme Court\\'s decision in Sackett v. EPA last year, isolated wetlands – wetlands that are not adjacent to navigable waters – are no longer federally regulated.\\nAs a result, 24 states, including many of Tennessee\\'s neighbors, don\\'t regulate any wetlands unregulated by the federal government. The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation requires developers to pay mitigation credits to offset the environmental costs to the surrounding community if they want to develop a wetland of more than 0.25 acres.\\nLawmakers are considering a proposal backed by developers to increase the limit to 0.5 acres ― something wildlife and environmental advocates say will harm communities and potentially cost the state millions in future stormwater management costs.\\nWetlands soak up floodwaters – an acre of wetlands can hold more than a million gallons of water. Wetlands also act as natural sponges and filters, helping keep water clean, and prolong hydration of streams, springs and aquifers during drought.\\nThe proposal to increase mitigation ratio limits was proposed this year by Sen. Brent Taylor, R-Memphis, and West Tennessee developer Rep. Kevin Vaughan, R-Collierville, but was deferred for summer study. It will need to be re-filed when the legislature returns in order to move forward.\\nProponents of the change argue that property owners should not have to pay mitigation fees in order to sell land for development, and requiring them to do so violates their property rights. Developers argue that the proposal is critical to lower costs of building workforce housing across the state amid an economic boom.\\n\\'This discussion is not really about property rights. It\\'s about money. And the fact that land use decisions impact our neighbors,\" said George Nolan of the Southern Environmental Law Center. \\'This is not the right time to turbocharge the hardening of our landscapes, but if we remove our wetlands protections, that\\'s exactly what will happen.\\'\\nSpeaking on behalf of the Tennessee Wildlife Federation, Morris Tipton said continued elimination of natural wetlands in the state could cost the millions down the road. Tennessee has already lost about 59% of its wetlands. Rebuilding wetlands that have been filled in is expensive, and new wetlands don\\'t function as natural ones do.\\nDevelopers and agricultural stakeholders argued that state regulation of wetlands could curtail citizens\\' property rights. Keith Grant, representing the Home Builder Association of Tennessee, shared several stories of landowners whose properties were unable to be sold because of state-required wetlands mitigation fees.\\nOne family in Memphis who was trying to sell property for a development was unable to sell the land because of an isolated wetland identified on the acreage on which two single purple flowers were found.\\nBecause of the flowers\\' rarity, TDEC classified the area as a high quality wetland, dramatically increasing the cost of mitigation. The site, which would have held 300 housing units in what would have been a $60 million development in Shelby County. But it was unable to be sold by the family due to extensive mitigation costs, Grant said.\\n\\'Sen. Taylor\\'s legislation is necessary to help ensure we have attainable workforce housing in our state,\\' Grant said. \\'Why would Tennessee be more stringent in regulating wetlands than federal government is when regulation lowers property owners\\' values and increasing housing costs for taxpaying citizens of Tennessee?\"\\nStefan Maupin, executive director of the Tennessee Soybean Promotion Council, shared outrage over what he argued was a violation of the property owners\\' rights, calling the regulation a \"very powerful tool to usurp every constitutional property right that Tennessee\\'s citizens have.\"\\n\\'This family that he discussed lost millions of dollars because they didn\\'t put a cage around the end of a pipe to keep a beaver from building a dam there? Folks, we\\'re talking about private property,\\' Maupin said. \\'How did we get here? We have become so desensitized to property rights relative to water.\\'\\nCasada, Cothren trial to be delayed\\nThe upcoming criminal trials of former House Speaker Glen Casada and his former aide Cade Cothren will be pushed into next year, a development that comes just weeks before the two were set to go to trial next month.\\nThe delay comes after a technology snafu on the part of federal prosecutors, who allegedly sent the entire contents of former House Rep. Robin Smith\\'s cell phone to parties in the ongoing criminal case.\\nThe phone records included protected materials like communications between her and her attorneys, and the Department of Justice was supposed to filter out any privileged information before defendants or the prosecution team viewed the contents.\\nSmith struck a swift plea deal in the spring of 2022, resigning from her House seat and apparently agreeing to testify on behalf of the prosecution.\\nThis summer, her attorneys moved to intervene in the case to suppress the privileged contents from being used in court, and both sides were told to stop reviewing any materials from Smith\\'s phone. But the materials included important trial prep and attorney notes, defendants\\' attorneys argued, and sifting out privileged information from non-privileged would not be quick work.\\nIn a late Thursday hearing, the federal judge overseeing the case agreed to push the trial back to April 2025.\\nCatch up on the week\\nWinfield Dunn, former governor and stalwart of the Tennessee GOP, dies at 97.\\nGot a question for us?',\n",

       "   'summary': 'AI-assisted summary\\nA $1.128 billion Mega Millions jackpot from March 2024 remains unclaimed in New Jersey.\\nIf unclaimed after one year, the jackpot money will be returned to participating states.\\nPrevious unclaimed jackpots have occurred, but none have reached $1 billion.\\nLottery officials speculate winners may be consulting financial advisors or developing spending plans.\\nSix months after a New Jersey player won the $1.128 billion Mega Millions jackpot, no one has claimed the prize.\\nAlthough the billion-dollar jackpot winner still has time, it wouldn\\'t be the first time that winning Mega Millions tickets have gone unclaimed.\\nThe lucky New Jersey ticket was bought on March 26 at a ShopRite Liquor in Neptune Township on the coast. The winning white ball numbers were 7, 11, 22, 29 and 38, while the gold Mega Ball was 4, the lottery said. After taxes, the ticket is worth $536.6 million.\\nJackpot winners in New Jersey have up to one year to claim their Mega Millions prize.\\nHere\\'s a look at the Mega Millions and its previous unclaimed jackpot winners, and what happens to unclaimed money.\\nWhat happens if no one claims the Mega Millions jackpot?\\nIf a jackpot prize goes unclaimed, each participating state in the Mega Millions game will get back all the money it contributed.\\n\"For multi-state games like Mega Millions, if the jackpot is unclaimed, the funds would go back to all the participating lotteries based on their share of sales,\" Dan Miller, a spokesperson for the Mega Millions, told USA TODAY. \"Every lottery has its own rules for distributing its unclaimed prizes.\"\\nThe billion-dollar jackpot was won in New Jersey, but the state does not get to keep all of the money.\\n\"If the prize goes unclaimed, New Jersey does not keep all $1.1 billion,\" he said. \"Most states either revert to a lottery\\'s beneficiary, or beneficiaries, or go back to players through extra prizes and promotions, or some combination of the two.\"\\nHas there been an unclaimed jackpot before?\\nWhile this is not the first time a jackpot winner has not claimed or delayed claiming their winnings, that hasn\\'t happened before with a billion-dollar jackpot, Miller said.\\nWinners in New York, Florida and other states have missed their chance at becoming millionaires.\\nMiller cited the following examples in New York: a $68 million jackpot in 2002, a $46 million one in 2003 and a $31 million one in 2006. In Florida last year, a $39 million jackpot went unclaimed, he said.\\nPlayers might not claim jackpot prize right away for several reasons\\nMiller explains that some people might wait longer to claim prizes for strategic reasons.\\n\\'Sometimes they\\'re talking with the financial advisor. Sometimes they\\'re trying to develop a plan for what they want to do with the money when they claim it,\\' Miller said. \\'Our hope was always that the people who win do come forward and claim their prize, because we obviously want the people who play to win.\\'\\nThe Mega Millions, which first began as the \\' Big Game \\' on Aug. 31, 1996, made history on March 30, 2012, as the world\\'s largest prize in any jackpot game, with an estimated jackpot of $656 million. Since then, the record has been broken time and again. As the jackpot continues to reach new highs, the lottery wants to remind players to check their tickets.\\nWhy is the Mega Millions cash option lower than the estimated jackpot?\\nMiller explained the difference between the estimated jackpot and the cash option.\\n\\'Say there\\'s an estimated jackpot that\\'s advertised as $100 million and the cash option is $50 million. A jackpot that\\'s advertised as $100 million is paid out to someone over a period of time,\\' Miller said. \\'It\\'s paid out over a number of years.\\'\\nWhen a player chooses the cash option, however, they\\'ll get their money quicker.\\n\\'They\\'re telling you that if you choose to be paid out all, all right now, you can take $50 million in cash today, but that\\'s all you\\'re going to get,\" he said.\\nNew Jersey players can remain anonymous\\nNew Jersey is among the states where lottery winners can remain anonymous because of a law enacted in 2020.\\nBut the lottery said that the identity of prize winners is shared with other state agencies because \"claims are reviewed for collection of unpaid obligations such as child support, student loan arrearages, and back taxes.\\'\\nWhat are the top Mega Millions jackpots?\\nAccording to the lottery, the following jackpots are the top 10 jackpots that have been won as of Oct. 4:\\n$1.602 billion, Aug. 8, 2023; a Florida player\\n$1.537 billion, Oct. 23, 2018; a South Carolina player\\n$1.348 billion, Jan.13, 2023; a Maine player\\n$1.337 billion, July 29, 2022; an Illinois player\\n$1.128 billion, March 26, 2024; a New Jersey payer\\n$1.050 billion, Jan. 22, 2021; a Michigan player\\n$810 million, Sept. 10, 2024; a Texas player\\n$656 million, March 30, 2012; a player from Illinois, Kansas and Maryland\\n$648 million, Dec. 17,2013; a player from California and Georgia\\n$552 million, June 4, 2024; an Illinois player\\nHow to play the Mega Millions\\nIn order to buy a ticket, you\\'ll have to visit your local convenience store, gas station or grocery store − and in a handful of states, you can purchase tickets online.\\nTo play, you will need to pick six numbers. Five numbers will be white balls ranging from 1 to 70.

Starr picked up an offer from Alabama on Thursday, adding to a growing list of powerhouse programs to court Starr in the aftermath of his commitment.\\n\\'I\\'m pretty locked in (to Auburn) right now, but I\\'m definitely still open to a few schools,\\' said Starr, who had a 33-yard touchdown catch in Ravenwood\\'s 45-0 win over Region 6-6A rival Summit. \\'I got a few more visits to take and then probably make my final decision in December.\\'\\nStarr is a four-star recruit and the No. 14 ranked player in Tennessee, according to 247Sports Composite. Starr holds offers from Auburn, Alabama, Michigan, Vanderbilt, Illinois among others. Illinois head coach Bret Bielema and defensive coordinator Aaron Henry were in attendance as well as Tennessee State and Georgia State.\\nStarr made a visit to Illinois Sept. 14 and was impressed with the Illini. He called the Illini his hometown team, having grown up in Illinois before moving to Williamson County his freshman year.\\nStarr gave the scouts in attendance a taste of his electrifying speed as he burst past his defender into open space to snag that 33-yard scoring pass from Maverick Chance. Chance added 103 yards rushing and two touchdowns, while completing 2-of-5 passes for 38 yards and a touchdown for the Raptors (7-0, 3-0 in 6-6A).\\nWhile Starr is still committed to Auburn he\\'ll be making the rounds to schools that have recently offered, including Michigan and Alabama.\\nStarr plans to attend Michigan\\'s Oct. 26 game against Big Ten rival Michigan State. He\\'ll also be in person at Vanderbilt when the Commodores take on South Carolina on Nov. 9.\\nWhile he hasn\\'t set a date, Starr said he plans to make a trip to Tuscaloosa to see Alabama, before locking in on a final choice later this year.\\n\\'It\\'s kind of unreal,\\' Starr said. \\'Everybody knows the standard for Alabama and how hard that offer is to get, so I\\'m definitely blessed and I was really excited when I got that offer.\\'\\nDespite becoming one of Tennessee\\'s highest profile recruits since the start of the season, the Raptors have seen little change from Starr off the field.\\n\\'It\\'s very easy when you get the attention that he gets, to allow yourself to lose focus of what\\'s important in life,\\' Raptors coach Will Hester said. \\'He\\'s a phenomenal kid, he spends time with all different groups of kids at our school and I\\'m just proud of the person that he is.\"\\n\\'He deserves the attention that he\\'s getting, not only because of the football player he is, but the person that he is.\\'',\n",

       "   'summary': 'Hi, Nashville! Tennessean business reporter Hadley Hitson here with your latest updates on food news in Music City.\\nI\\'m writing to you from Germantown where Oktoberfest is kicking off in Bicentennial Park tonight — offering an \"authentic German culinary experience\" with beer, brats, sausages, schnitzel, strudel and more. Tickets are $10, and the event will be on through Sunday.\\nAnd if you\\'re looking to expand you\\'re culinary horizons even further, you\\'re in luck. The global food scene in Nashville is exploding, and our food writers Mackensy Lunsford and Brad Schmitt put together a restaurant-by-restaurant guide with everything you need to know. Beyond Asian and Italian food, restaurants dedicated to food from Central and South America, the Middle East, Vietnam and Africa are all on the list.\\nHotspots for international restaurants in Nashville fall along three main corridors: Nolensville Pike, Murfreesboro Pike and Thompson Lane. Mackensy and Brad dubbed that the city\\'s global food triangle.\\nOf course, my (potentially unrealistic) goal is to make it to all of them, but the vada pav sandwich with spiced potato dumplings and Indian amul cheese at Surati Indian Street Food particularly caught my eye. And it earned five stars on the list.\\nIn other news, several notable restaurant and bar owners in Nashville recently organized the Nashville Black Hospitality Group to attract more tourism dollars to Black-owned businesses. A few familiar faces in the group include Naima Walker with Germantown Pub, Mignon Francois of The Cupcake Collection and Marcus Capehart of pH Craft Cocktails.\\nAlso, the highly-anticipated opening of Chef Julio Hernandez\\'s Maiz de la Vida brick-and-mortar will open on Monday. This is a dive into the menu and how the restaurant will differ from Hernandez\\'s food truck.\\nHere\\'s some other interesting restaurant and dining coverage you may have missed this week:\\nRead about how a thriving community of immigrant-owned restaurants in South Nashville is creating a new \"culinary district\" for the city.\\nRagab Rashwan grew up cooking in Cairo restaurants. Now, he has his own in Nashville, serving up traditional Egyptian cuisine.\\nAs dozens of Nashville restaurants are shutting their doors this year, Thai spot Siam Cafe continues to flourish, serving up a menu that has changed very little over the last 40 years. Owner Billy Silpacharn explains his approach.\\nHow Columbian restaurant La Cucharita survived COVID and continues to adapts to the changing restaurant industry.\\nWell, that\\'s all from me today! Thanks for reading, and as always, let me know if you have any questions, comments or restaurant suggestions. You can reach me anytime at hhitson@tennessean.com.',\n",

Their hope is that the clot dissolves naturally and doesn't require an operation.\\nAfter the injury, Declan Deering told Beech's staff his head was in pain and was immediately taken to the training room. He was later transported by ambulance from Hendersonville to the hospital in Nashville. Deering's mother praised Beech medical trainer Kaydy Wellendorf for her handling of the situation.\\n'She did more than everything right. No doubt her responsiveness kept us from being in a very serious situation,' Beth Deering said. 'The way everyone responded was exactly as it should have been.'\\nDeclan Deering had appeared in all five games for Class 5A No. No. 4 Beech (5-1, 2-0 Region 7-5A) up until the time of his injury.

He was also reunited with a young fan whom he would routinely connect with during warmups while with Carolina.\\n\"Her name is Emma,\" Skjei said. \"She sits in the corner every single game where I do a little stick handling warmup. Every game, I would usually flip a puck to her and give her a knock on the glass. Last night she came from the (Carolina side) of the ice so I could do the same thing. It was pretty fun.\"\\nSkjei, 30, signed a seven-year, $49 million contract with the Predators over the summer, the largest contract he\\'s signed in the NHL. The 6-foot-3, 210-pound defenseman has developed into a reliable two-way player since being drafted by the Rangers in the first round in 2012. In 609 career games, Skjei has scored 68 goals and 179 assists while averaging 20:38 per game.\\nThe Predators are expected to slot Skjei with Roman Josi on the top pairing. Last season, Josi played with Ryan McDonagh, who was traded back to Tampa in the offseason.\\nThe Hurricanes also raised over $235,000 to go to victims of Hurricane Helene, something Skjei said he was proud to be a part of.\\nSkjei will have two chances to face the Hurricanes in the regular season. The first comes on Dec. 23 at Bridgestone Arena, the second is at Carolina on March 25.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'A murder trial is delayed after a state audit found the Davidson County District Attorney\\'s Office eavesdropped on defense attorneys using recording devices planted throughout its office.\\nJudge Cynthia Chappell on Wednesday called off the upcoming trial of Calvin Atchison, accused of killing 30-year-old Velma Tharpe in North Nashville in the summer of 2000. NewsChannel5 first reported that the trial was being postponed from its planned Oct. 7 start date.\\nThe report from the Tennessee Comptroller\\'s Office released last week found District Attorney Glenn Funk\\'s office regularly recorded audio and video of criminal defense attorneys without their knowledge while they were in the DA\\'s office, particularly in a room defense attorneys used to review evidence in criminal cases.\\nThe report was particularly troubling for Atchison\\'s attorney Ben Powers, who said he specifically had been audio recorded without his knowledge. According to Powers, he and a private investigator are seen in a still image from a video recording included in the report. The caption states investigators found an audio recording of the defense team seen in the photograph.\\nPowers asked the judge on Monday to disqualify the district attorney\\'s office from prosecuting the case because of the \"unethical tactics\" prosecutors used to gather information.\\n\"[T]he appearance of impropriety is so glaring, so organized and so far-reaching that the only cure is for the DA\\'s Office to be disqualified from prosecuting Calvin Atchison\\'s case so that his rights remain intact and so that the public\\'s trust may be restored,\" Powers wrote.\\nChappell chose to delay the trial and said she will schedule a hearing on the motion to disqualify the DA\\'s office.\\nTennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti said he did not believe there was sufficient basis to prosecute Funk over the allegations in the report, but he reminded the county\\'s top prosecutor in a letter that the closure of the investigation did not absolve the office of \"any ethical duties that may be implicated by the underlying concerns.\" Lt. Gov. Randy McNally and Tennessee Comptroller Jason Mumpower have called for a special prosecutor to examine any potential violations of law by the DA\\'s office.\\nAtchison, 55, was indicted in May 2021, after prosecutors determined the man who pleaded guilty years earlier had not actually committed the crime. Paul Shane Garrett pleaded guilty to manslaughter in 2003 and was released from prison in 2011. All charges against Garrett were dropped in 2021, and he received a $1.2 million settlement in a lawsuit against Metro Nashville in early 2023.',\n",

'His legacy will live on in the hearts of all who knew him.'\\nWife asks for prayers for her late husband and their family\\nSatcher, the fire chief, graduated from high school in 1989 and immediately joined the Circle Fire Department. He worked there for 35 years and became a fire chief in January 2023, according to his online obituary.\\nSatcher worked as a licensed plumber and as a foreman for Derrick Plumbing since 1992, his obituary reads. He put in thousands of hours training to hone in his skills as a firefighter and was 'highly respected within the firefighting community,' his obituary read.\\nHe racked up a series of awards during his tenure with the Circle Fire Department and was named the department's Fireman of the Year in 1992, 1995, 2012, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2020 and 2022. He also received the Saluda County Fire Service's Firefighter of the Year in 2017.\\nHe mentored, served as a training officer and also worked with the Saluda County Fire Board and Fire Prevention Committee, according to his obituary.\\nHe was an avid churchgoer, husband and father. He married his wife, Summer, in April 2001.\\nAfter his wife heard about his accident, she made a plea on social media for prayers for both him and Bodie.\\n'Pray hard,' she wrote. 'Chad and another firefighter have been in an accident and they can't get to them and they aren't answering the radio or phones. Please pray.'\\nAfter he passed, she shared an update with loved ones online.\\n'I have no words right now except to say that we feel your love, prayers and support,' she wrote, adding that she was heartbroken. 'The love of my life, my best friend, is gone. Please continue to pray for us. We love you all.'\",\n",

In addition, they have waived defenseman Nick Blankenburg.\\nThe team now has 13 forwards, 10 defensemen, and two goaltenders on their roster.\\nMost notably, the team has kept 19-year-old Tanner Molendyk in training camp for now.\\nGeneral manager Barry Trotz still has time to decide what to do with his 2023 first-round pick. If Molendyk does not make the team, he will have to return to his junior club in Saskatoon (WHL) until the end of the year. If he makes the team, he can't be assigned to Milwaukee until he turns 20 in February.\\nThe Predators can opt to play Molendyk in up to nine NHL games before making the final decision.\\nNashville has two more preseason games before they must trim their roster to 23. They play Saturday afternoon against Carolina at Bridgestone Arena and Monday night at Tampa, a makeup game from the Hurricane Helene postponement.\",\n",

       "   'summary': 'Florida\\'s homeless law is now in effect. On Tuesday, sleeping or camping on public property in the state was made illegal, and camping areas must be set up to accommodate the homeless community.\\nStatute 1365, formerly House Bill (HB) 1365, will make it illegal for people struggling with homelessness to sleep outside on public land.\\n\"HB 1365 prohibits counties and municipalities from authorizing or allowing individuals to regularly sleep or camp on public property, at public buildings or their grounds, or on public rights-of-way within their jurisdictions,\" said the county\\'s mayor, Daniella Levine Cava, in a memorandum sent to the Board of County Commissioners in September.\\nStarting January 1, 2025, cities or municipalities that fail to comply within five days of a written complaint could \"face legal action from any resident or business owner within their jurisdictions or the Florida Attorney General,\" stated the memorandum.\\nThe camping areas the municipalities are mandated to provide must be approved by the Florida Department of Children and Families and include security, behavioral health services, and bathrooms with running water.\\nFlorida cities react to new homeless law\\nThe mayor of Pensacola, D.C. Reeves, announced that he planned to use $1 million in unencumbered American Rescue Plan Act funds to purchase small, semi-permanent shelters, according to the Pensacola News Journal.\\n\"Arresting our way out of homelessness is not going to solve our problem,\" Reeves said. \"So, having that release valve of additional units coming online much faster than a long process, it\\'s really why I pivoted from the low-barrier shelter that we were talking about.\"\\nReeves was previously interested in using the funds to kick-start a low-barrier homeless shelter, but that idea was taken off the table earlier this year when a report from Jon DeCarmine, executive director of GRACE Marketplace in Gainesville, showed start-up cost would be between $2.19 million and $3.47 million.\\nShelters will be placed throughout the community to increase the stock of housing available and get people off the street.\\nMeanwhile, one agency in Miami-Dade County doesn\\'t think the new statute will help reduce homelessness.\\n\\'We reject sanctioned encampments and believe there is no evidence that they reduce homelessness,\\' said Ron Book, Chairman of the Miami-Dade County Homeless Trust, in a statement. \\'We are committed to investing in solutions that deliver long-term results and bringing new partners in, as we firmly believe we can end homelessness in Miami-Dade.\\'\\nIn the last year, the City of Miami, City of Miami Beach, and Miami-Dade County have seen a a 2% increase in homelessness since 2023, according to an annual census conducted by the trust.\\nIt will conduct the census again in January, as mandated by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.\\nUSA TODAY has contacted Miami-Dade County and the City of Tampa about the new law, but has not yet heard back.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'Editor\\'s note: As part of The Tennessean\\'s season-long, all-access series about the Brentwood Academy football program, we regularly visit with a player or coach on this year\\'s team. This week, we talk with junior running back/linebacker Arkez Fontenot. To follow along with the series, please subscribe to The Tennessean here.\\nArkez Fontenot was in his bathroom one early January morning this year when he heard his mother, Jacie\\' Fontenot, crying.\\nIt was 5 a.m.\\nShe\\'s usually not up that early.\\n\"I\\'m like, \\'What\\'s wrong, mom?\\' \" said Fontenot, a Brentwood Academy junior. \"She\\'s like, \\'I\\'ll tell you later when you come home.\\' \"\\nIt was Christmas break. Arkez was getting ready to go to Winterim, a program at the school that \"provides opportunities to fulfill the school\\'s mission through exploration in academics, arts, outdoors, and athletics.\"\\nHe wasn\\'t about to leave his mother\\'s tears to his imagination. He insisted she explain them.\\nThe next two words out of her Jacie\\'s mouth overwhelmed Arkez.\\nWalter\\'s dead.\\nWalter Joslin Jr., his mother\\'s longtime boyfriend, the only \"father figure I ever had,\" had died of health struggles that included pneumonia, obesity and depression.\\nThe sadness born in Arkez\\'s heart made its way straight for his throat. The reality of his mother\\'s words then headed for his eyes.\\nHe, too, was now crying.\\n\"I\\'m like, \\'Are you serious?\\' \" Arkez said. \"I just kept thinking the whole time, \\'This can\\'t be real.\\' \"\\n\\'Offer? Are you playing?\\'\\nA little more than two months after that January morning, Arkez Fontenot and his mother found themselves at Miami of Ohio.\\nHe was on the verge of tears. Happy ones this time.\\nHe was on a college visit. Again, the kid, whose teammates and coaches describe as a pleaser, a person who is too hard on himself for all the right reasons, found himself in a state of disbelief.\\nA man named Chuck Martin, the Miami of Ohio head football coach, offered the words this time. An exhausting, six-hour drive was still fresh.\\n\"He\\'s like, \\'Good finally meeting you,\\' \" Arkez said. \"He was like, \\'We would like to offer you.\\' \"\\nLike that January morning, Arkez couldn\\'t believe what he was hearing. He couldn\\'t help but think of how proud Walter would be.\\n\"I\\'m like, \\'Offer? Are you playing?\\' \" Arkez said. \"My mom hit me, she was like, \\'Just say thank you.\\' I\\'m still looking at him like, \\'Are you playing?\\' \"\\nThen reality hit again. He\\'d just received his first college scholarship offer.\\nThis time when Arkez Fontenot looked at his teary-eyed mother, he could feel her joy.\\n\"She was just smiling,\" he said.\\nSame as she was when Marshall and Minnesota and Toledo and Arkansas State offered her son in June.\\n\\'He\\'d just want me to do better for myself\\'\\nThe George MacIntyres (Tennessee recruit) and Stephon Shivers (Georgia recruit) and Neo Cliftons (MTSU recruit) of the Brentwood Academy football world tend to overshadow the Arkez Fontenots.\\n\"He\\'s kind of one of those guys who flies under the radar,\" Brentwood Academy football coach Paul Wade said. \"Simply because some of the seniors have kind of stolen a little bit of the college popularity, if you will.\"\\nFontenot, who leads the Eagles with 235 yard rushing on 53 carries and has 11 catches for 139 yards, is fine with that.\\nThe kid who moved from Stockton, California, to Nashville when he was 3 years old, the kid who has nine siblings on his dad\\'s side of the family, is too busy trying to make his mother, grandmother and Walter proud.\\nHe regularly cuts teammates\\' hair. He loves to cook. He\\'s become quite the football player.\\n\"He\\'s been a hard worker since he was a little kid,\" said Clifton, who has known Fontenot since second grade. \"He\\'s grown into a role.\"\\nHe\\'s done it without much pomp and circumstance. He\\'s done it to help his teammates.\\n\"He took me in when I first got here last year, introduced me to everybody,\" said Fontenot\\'s locker neighbor, Easton Joiner, who moved from Kentucky. \"Arkez is always going to look out.\"\\nJust like his mother and his father figure taught him.\\n\"I keep thinking , \\'He would want me to do better for myself, keep going,\\' \" Arkez said of Walter.\\nPaul Skrbina is a sports enterprise reporter covering the Predators, Titans, Nashville SC, local colleges and local sports for The Tennessean.

       "   'summary': 'Members of the International Longshoremen\\'s Association walked off the job on Tuesday amid demands of better pay and a contract that expired on Monday.\\nAlmost 25,000 dockworkers at various ports along the East and Gulf Coasts are striking to ask for higher pay and protections from having their jobs automated out of existence.\\nMarking the first such strike in almost 50 years, members of the International Longshoremen\\'s Association walked off the job on Tuesday. In a social media post, the union\\'s president Harold Daggett said the union was fighting for \\'the kind of wages we deserve.\\'\\nIn a statement on Monday, the union blamed the United States Maritime Alliance, which represents docks and ocean carriers, for continuing to block an agreement that would end the strike.\\n\\'The Ocean Carriers represented by USMX want to enjoy rich billion-dollar profits that they are making in 2024, while they offer ILA Longshore Workers an unacceptable wage package that we reject,\" the statement said.\\nWhile 14 ports in the East and Gulf Coast are seeing striking workers, West Coast ports have not been affected as a different union represents its workers. Back in 2023, the West Coast union negotiated wage increases for its workers.\\nWhat do dockworkers make? What wages are they proposing?\\nThe wages negotiated by the West Coast dockworkers union is one of the reasons for the current strike. ILA workers make significantly less than their counterparts.\\nThe IL A contract that expired on Monday shows that the starting pay for dockworkers was $20 per hour. Pay rises to $24.75 after two years, $31.90 after three and tops out at $39 for workers with at least six years on the job.\\nMeanwhile, the ILA is demanding a 77% increase over the duration of the contract, with a $5 increase each year of the contract. Workers would make $44 the first year, $49 the second and up to $69 in the final year.\\nIn recent days, the U.S. Maritime Alliance proposed a smaller increase, nearly 50%, which the ILA rejected.\\n\"They might claim a significant increase, but they conveniently omit that many of our members are operating multi-million-dollar container-handling equipment for a mere $20 an hour. In some states, the minimum wage is already $15,\" the ILA said.\\nThe current top wage amounts to about $81,000 per year, but according to a Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor report about a third of local longshoremen made $200,000 or more a year.\\nHowever, that pay may come with extreme hours. The ILA president, Harold Daggett, told the Associated Press that many of the workers earning high wages work up to 100 hours a week.\\n\\'Our members don\\'t work typical 9-to-5 jobs; they work extraordinary hours, sacrificing time with their families. Our position is firm: we believe in the value our incredible rank-and-file members bring to this industry and to our great nation,\\' the ILA said in a statement.\\nThe average U.S. salary was about $59,000 in the fourth quarter of 2023, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor.',\n",

The Miyazaki airport was constructed by the Imperial Japanese Navy in 1943 as a training base for aviation cadets, as well as an airfield from which kamikaze pilots took off on suicide attack missions.

He was pressed on a Minnesota abortion law he signed and what extent it allows the procedure late in a pregnancy. He said the Minnesota law \\'puts the decision with a woman and her health care providers.\\'\\nSome Republican lawmakers and candidates across the country have alleged that Democrats widely want people who are pregnant to be able to obtain an abortion at any time, even if they are weeks from potentially giving birth.\\nAbortions in the third trimester of pregnancy are already rare, and they typically occur because of serious fetal abnormalities. In 2019, about 93% of abortions occurred at or before 13 weeks of gestation. About 1% of abortions occurred at 21 weeks or later, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\\nThe governor accused Trump of supporting a national abortion ban, though the former president has explicitly said he wouldn\\'t block abortion nationwide. Asked if Trump is lying, Walz said \\'yes, of course.\\'\\nWalz and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris have taken a cautious and limited approach to media appearances in recent weeks. But The Democratic candidates are ramping up their media schedule in the closing weeks of the campaign.\\nHarris sat for an interview with the CBS program \\'60 Minutes\\' and has other interviews scheduled, including with less traditional outlets like the \"Call Her Daddy\" podcast.\\nHowever, Walz didn\\'t specifically answer every question in his first appearance on a so-called Sunday show. Asked if he supported Israel engaging in a preemptive strike against Iran nuclear or oil facilities, Walz was noncommittal, saying: \\'Specific operations will be dealt with at the time.\\'\\nThe governor also was confronted about multiple instances where he has misrepresented aspects of his life, including his military service, travel to China and fertility issues.\\nAsked whether people can trust him, Walz said \\'I will own up when I misspeak, I will own up when I make a mistake\\' and then trained his fire on Vance, pointing out he refused to acknowledge at the debate that Trump lost the 2020 election.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'With the federal response to Hurricane Helene becoming a major focus of the presidential campaign in the home stretch, President Joe Biden\\'s administration continued to push back Sunday against former President Donald Trump\\'s unfounded claims about storm recovery.\\nAppearing on ABC\\'s \\'This Week\\' Sunday, Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Criswell said her agency has all the resources it needs to respond to Helene, which ravaged parts of Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and other states.\\nNorth Carolina and Georgia are key swing states, which has heightened the political stakes for the recovery effort and the jockeying around it.\\nCriswell defended FEMA\\'s response and shot down Trump\\'s claims that the agency is short on disaster relief funds because money has been diverted to help undocumented immigrants, and that help is being withheld from Republican areas, calling such assertions \\'frankly ridiculous and just plain false.\\'\\n\\'This kind of rhetoric is not helpful to people,\\' she added. \\'It\\'s really a shame that we\\'re putting politics ahead of helping people.\\'\\nCriswell noted that state and local officials have pushed back \\'on this dangerous, truly dangerous narrative that is creating this fear.\\'\\nTrump has made a series of unfounded claims about Helene recovery at multiple events in recent days. He said at a rally in Saginaw, Michigan, Thursday that \\'Kamala spent all her FEMA money, billions of dollars, on housing for illegal immigrants.\\'\\n\\'They have almost no money, because they spent it all on illegal immigrants,\\' Trump said, adding that \\'They stole the FEMA money, just like they stole it from a bank, so they could give it to their illegal immigrants.\\'\\nFEMA does have a housing program, the Shelter and Services Program, that provides \\'financial support to non-federal entities to provide humanitarian services to noncitizen migrants following their release\\' from detention facilities, according to its website. It has $650 million in funding this year, but that money is separate from disaster relief funds.\\n\\'No money is being diverted from disaster response needs. None,\\' the White House said in a news release.\\nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told reporters during a White House press briefing last week that FEMA has enough disaster relief money to meet current needs, but not for additional storms.\\n\\'We are meeting the immediate needs with the money that we have,\\' Mayorkas said. \\'We are expecting another hurricane hitting. We do not have the funds. FEMA does not have the funds to make it through the season and... what is imminent.\\'\\nCongress recently appropriated $20 billion in disaster funds, but Biden said in a letter this week that more is needed.\\n\\'Without additional funding, FEMA would be required to forego longer-term recovery activities in favor of meeting urgent needs,\\' Biden wrote, saying the Small Business Administration is particularly in need of funds.\\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., was asked on \"Fox News Sunday\" about Biden\\'s letter and said \\'Congress will provide, we will help the people in these disaster prone areas.\\'\\nJohnson was pressed about Trump conflating FEMA funds for the Shelter and Services Program with disaster relief money and conceded that \"the streams of funding are different, that is not an untrue statement of course.\" But he argued FEMA shouldn\\'t be spending any money \"for resettling illegal aliens who have come across the border.\"\\nTrump continued to criticize the Helene recovery effort at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, Saturday. He zeroed in on the $750 payment FEMA offers disaster victims to help them with immediate needs.\\n\\'Remember, $750 to people whose homes have been washed away, and yet we send tens of millions of dollars to foreign countries that most people have never heard of,\\' Trump said. \\'They\\'re offering them $750 as they\\'ve been destroyed. \\'\\nThe $750 Serious Needs Assistance helps \\'cover essential items like food, water, baby formula, breastfeeding supplies, medication and other emergency supplies,\\' according to the White House press release.\\n\\'There are other forms of assistance that you may qualify for to receive, and Serious Needs Assistance is an initial payment you may receive while FEMA assesses your eligibility for additional funds,\\' the release continues.\\nRepublican National Committee co-chair Lara Trump, the daughter-in-law of the former president, also answered questions about Trump\\'s Helene claims during an appearance on CNN\\'s \"State of the Union\" Sunday. Host Dana Bash played a clip of Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., praising the response to Helene.\\n\"I\\'m actually impressed with how much attention was paid to region that wasn\\'t likely to have experienced the impact that they did,\" Tillis said, adding \"I\\'m out here to say that we\\'re doing a good job.\"\\nLara Trump defended the criticism of Helene recovery as \"coming directly from people there.\"\\n\"You can go online, you can look at videos of people recording themselves and posting online saying: \\'We need help, no one has come here, we have nothing,\" Trump said.',\n",

       "   'summary': '\"Saturday Night Live\" jabbed Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz\\'s vice presidential debate in its latest episode, mocking the largely civil debate between the two Midwestern leaders.\\nSaturday\\'s cold open began with Maya Rudolph, portraying Vice President Kamala Harris, and Andy Samberg, portraying second gentleman Doug Emhoff, cozying up at home on the couch to watch the CBS debate between Bowen Yang\\'s cheeky Vance and Jim Gaffigan\\'s affable Walz.\\nChloe Fineman and Heidi Gardner, as CBS News anchors Norah O\\'Donnell as Margaret Brennan, welcomed the \"candidates\" before Yang began his opening statement:\\n\\'I want to begin with something that\\'ll appeal to women voters. I understand that both the moderators tonight are mothers and,\\' he laughed, \\'I like that.\\'\\nThe joke appeared to reference Vance\\'s past comments about women who don\\'t have children, which he\\'s faced bipartisan criticism over since joining the GOP ticket.\\n\\'Governor Walz, it looks like you\\'re already scribbling a bunch of notes,\\' Fineman added \\'Are you preparing your answers?\\'\\n\\'Nah, I gotta grade these papers,\\' Gaffigan said, playing on Walz\\'s tenure as a social studies teacher. \\'Got a stack of midterms.\\'\\nCutting back to the second couple, Samberg\\'s Emhoff reassured his wife, saying \\'Tim will be fine, it\\'s not like he\\'s going to say something crazy.\\'\\nThe camera cut back to Gaffigan telling the audience \\'I\\'ve become friends with school shooters,\\' a reference to a flub Walz made during Tuesday\\'s debate.\\nStill, \"SNL\" didn\\'t spare either candidate.\\n\\'Senator Vance, you called Donald Trump America\\'s Hitler. Do you regret that?\\' Gardner asks Yang\\'s Vance.\\nIn a 2016 message to a friend, Vance wrote that he goes \"back and forth\" between wondering if Trump was simply a cynical politician or \"that he\\'s America\\'s Hitler.\" However, since entering politics and winning his Senate seat in 2022, Vance has been one of Trump\\'s most vocal supporters.\\n\\'Well look, the context matters. I meant that as a compliment,\\' the fictional Vance retorted.\\nAsked about having incorrectly said that he was in Hong Kong during the Tienanmen Square Massacre, the fictional Walz told the audience in one of the sketch\\'s biggest laugh lines \"I think what happened is I went to EPCOT.\"\\nHowever, Gaffigan and Yang also played up the civility, bordering on cordiality, that was on display Tuesday night between Vance and Walz. In the sketch, the two reached out their hands to each other across the split-screen after discovering the \\'common ground\\' they share − wanting to walk back things they\\'ve said.\\n\\'Ok, I\\'m not sure why you two are connecting but let\\'s move on,\\' says Gardner, perplexed.\\n\\'Why are they friends? Why are they vibing?\\' Rudolph yells after a spit-take of wine.\\nFormer SNL cast member Dana Carvey, who previously played former President George H.W. Bush, appeared again as Joe Biden, tottering into Harris\\'s living room and sitting down in between the second couple on the couch.\\n\\'Walz? What\\'s wrong with that guy?\\' Carvey fired off. \\'He\\'s crazy, get your facts straight, Jack. You gotta hit \\'em with a little joke. \\'Here\\'s the deal. Let me be clear.\\'\\'\\nHe smashes Rudolph in the face gesticulating with an ice cream cone before pledging to run again in 2028.\\nSNL will return October 12 with host Ariana Grande and musical guest Stevie Nicks.',\n",

       "   'summary': 'The Ryman Auditorium, deemed the \"Mother Church of Country Music,\" has a long and storied past since it first opened its doors in 1892.\\nAs The Tennessean considered the current state of Nashville\\'s live music venues, we also dug into the archives to revisit the Ryman\\'s rich record.\\nThe space was originally built as the Union Gospel Tabernacle by Captain Thomas G. Ryman, a Tennessean riverboat captain and businessman.\\nRyman decided he wanted to build a church in Nashville after attending an event with evangelist and preacher Sam Jones. His venue, the Tabernacle, hosted church services, preachers, lecturers and community events.\\nIt was in 1895 that the church raised money at its Easter service to build the iconic wooden church pews — ones that still lay in the venue today.\\nRyman died in 1904 at 63 years old after a long and painful illness, and in his honor, the building was renamed the Ryman Auditorium.\\nThe church-turned-performance venue was one of the largest spaces for shows in the city at the time, so performers like Harry Houdini, Bob Hope and Mae West — celebrities with huge international fan bases — hit the stage at the Ryman.\\nThe Ryman became the home of the live radio show the Grand Ole Opry from 1943 to 1974.\\nThe radio show had been in four different venues, the National Life building, the Hillsboro Theatre (now The Belcourt Theatre), the Dixie Tabernacle and the War Memorial Auditorium, but it needed a larger space still.\\nDuring the 30 years of the Opry at the Ryman, revered country artists including Dolly Parton, Tammy Wynette, Loretta Lynn, Hank Williams and Patsy Cline all made their Opry debuts. The Ryman also saw the birth of bluegrass within its walls with a music-history-making performance from Earl Scruggs in \\'45.\\nIn 1956, Johnny Cash joined the Opry; in 1960, Patsy Cline came on board. Backstage at the Ryman is also famously where June Carter would meet Johnny Cash in 1956.\\nIn \\'74, the Opry moved to its own Opry House across town, and the Ryman fell into disrepair after sitting empty. The building was set to be demolished, and residents fought hard for it to be saved from the bulldozers. After a successful effort, the Ryman was restored in the early \\'90s.\\nAfter the Ryman was saved, the musical shows never ended.\\nStars continued to laud the space\\'s acoustics, raving that it\\'s one of the best-sounding venues in the world. Since the venue was originally built as a church, its acoustics are uniquely positioned for a sonic experience that some consider to be sacred — and the building, hallowed ground.\\nWhen it comes to the Ryman Auditorium in modernity, it\\'s a hot concert stop for musicians across all genres, from country to pop, rock and the blues. Harry Styles hit the stage in 2017 for his Ryman debut, and the Wu-Tang Clan became the first hip-hop headliner in the venue\\'s history in 2019.\\n2022 saw the venue\\'s first headlining drag show, and the same year, the Ryman became a Rock & Roll Hall of Fame landmark.\\nMost recently, artists Terri Clark and Molly Tuttle made their headlining Ryman Auditorium debuts this year.\\nTo learn more about the Ryman Auditorium, visit ryman.com.',\n",

Red states are redder, blue states are bluer, and our politics is more heated.\\nTo help you better understand your county and community, USA TODAY compiled crucial data that provides insights into how your area has changed racially, ethnically, politically, and economically since 2020. This resource answers key questions, such as how your county voted in the last three elections and whether your precinct is a political outlier. It also offers important information on early and absentee voting, which are increasingly popular among voters — one-third of whom cast their ballots by mail in the 2022 election.\\nEnter your county in the search bar, or if you're unsure, use the map to search for the address. Click on the map to explore other areas in the country that are politically similar to yours.\\nJoe Biden won the 2020 presidential race by razor-thin margins in key battleground states, edging out Trump by less than 1% in Georgia, Arizona, and Wisconsin. (Though Biden won 51% of the votes nationwide, to Trump's 47%.)\\nCurrent polls suggest this election will be just as tight, potentially hinging on a few thousand votes in key areas.\\nNearly 160 million people cast their ballots in the 2020 general election, accounting for two-thirds of the voting-eligible population. The 2022 congressional election, which took place in the aftermath of the U.S. Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade, saw a 52.2% voter turnout, the second-highest participation rate in a midterm election since 2000.\\nOf the 233.5 million Americans of voting age, 161.4 million were registered voters as of November 2022, with 23.2% below 35 years old and 26.6% aged 65 years or above, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.\\nWhile they make up similarly sized slices of the electorate, only 35% of young voters turned out in 2022, compared to 67% of older voters.\\nPast voting patterns reveal a deepening partisan divide, with red areas getting redder and blue areas getting bluer. This divide has intensified along geographic lines, as Trump improved his margins in rural areas while Biden extended Hillary Clinton's margins in urban areas.\\nAccording to a USA TODAY analysis of voting patterns among 3,113 counties, three-fourths of the counties became either redder or bluer in the 2020 presidential election compared to the 2012 re-election of Barack Obama, while 40 states saw political leanings intensify in more than half of their counties. Only a handful of counties flipped to the opposite party.\",\n",

Look, Vanderbilt will win again. But there won\\'t be another golden celebration quite like this one. It spilled into the usual Saturday night revelry of Nashville, grabbing a fun-loving city\\'s attention for once, when most of the time the city tunes out the Commodores.\\nPlenty of people around here will end up saying they were there when Vanderbilt toppled mighty Alabama. It\\'ll be far more than the actual number of Vanderbilt fans who were at FirstBank Stadium to witness the Commodores\\' stunning 40-35 victory and storm the field afterward.\\nBecause most of the spectators in the stadium Saturday were wearing crimson and white. I\\'ll give Alabama fans 75% — and it might have been more.\\nThat\\'s hardly unique at Vanderbilt, and everyone knows it.\\nIn the wake of Saturday\\'s victory, the Commodores splashed a clip on the stadium\\'s new big video board of former Alabama coach Nick Saban from a couple of weeks ago. He told ESPN\\'s \\'The Pat McAfee Show\\' that \"the only place you play in the SEC that\\'s not hard to play is Vanderbilt.\\'\\n\\'Because when you go to Vanderbilt, you have more fans there than they have,\\' Saban continued. \\'And that\\'s no disrespect to them. It\\'s just the truth.\\'\\nVanderbilt can drink in the delicious satisfaction of beating Alabama, of all teams, after such a statement.\\nBut Saban wasn\\'t wrong.\\nAlabama lost on Saturday despite having a \\'road\\' atmosphere that was very much in its corner. The Crimson Tide \\'s rabid fan base is famous for such invasions, but Virginia Tech\\'s fans did the same thing earlier this season.\\nVanderbilt beat Virginia Tech anyway. And now it has beaten Alabama, leaving little room to quarrel with the following two sentences:\\nLea has a dang good football team.\\nAnd it is high time its own fan base turns out to support it on game days.\\n\\'What we need to do is fill the stadium with black and gold shirts,\\' Lea said. \\'And when we do that, it will be a hard place to play. It may not be the biggest, but it is on top of you, and it can get loud. I think this is a glimpse as to what Saturday night in Nashville can be.\\'\\nLea\\'s emotion after this victory was well-earned. This was easily his biggest win yet as a head coach. It was the biggest in modern program history, and Lea is a Vanderbilt guy. Ever since he returned, he has boldly talked up Vanderbilt\\'s potential in football like few others would dare. He once showed up at SEC Media Days and proclaimed to chuckles that he wanted Vanderbilt to be the best program in the country, and \\'that\\'s what I\\'m after,\\' he reiterated Saturday.\\n\\'It\\'s cheap a little bit to bring that up right now,\\' Lea said after beating the AP poll\\'s No. 1-ranked team, \\'but that\\'s what I said, and I think when I said it no one really understood it. But the people that know me and know what we\\'re doing here understood.\\'\\nIt\\'s difficult to feel like a big-time program when visiting fans so consistently swarm your stadium and outnumber your own. That\\'s not just a competitive disadvantage. Recruits are in those seats, too.\\nVanderbilt, in fairness, did have supporters in attendance Saturday. Some of them were noisy at times. Shoutout to the students, for instance. Their presence was noticeable. They\\'ve been turning out wonderfully this season.\\nFor years, though, the gap has been vast between Lea\\'s expressed vision for Vanderbilt\\'s program and its results on the field. That\\'s why more fans haven\\'t bought in to the Commodores as a serious contender. They are so accustomed to disappointment. Until lately, that pessimism has been understandable.\\nNo more, though. Vanderbilt fans should be proud of this team. It\\'s a feisty, fun group to watch, with quarterback Diego Pavia embodying a team-wide mentality of not flinching in big moments. Or when faced with superior talent. The Commodores on Saturday outcoached and mentally and physically outplayed an opponent that\\'s dripping with top talent and a program that won 59-0 the last time it played in Vanderbilt\\'s stadium.\\nThis was (pause for impact) Alabama football. And Vanderbilt didn\\'t care in the slightest. Wasn\\'t the least bit scared. It\\'s easy to root for a team like that. The Commodores probably aren\\'t going to win all their remaining games, but they have earned the right to believe they have a chance against anyone.\\nThey just need their fan base to think that, too.\\n\\'A night like tonight hopefully moves the needle for some,\\' Lea said. \\'Hopefully, the next time we\\'re at home, you get a sense of what this could be in terms of Vanderbilt\\'s support for our program. I\\'m not bitter by that. We have to play a certain way for people to take interest.\\'\\nOn Saturday, Vanderbilt played that way.\\nI\\'d imagine all those people wearing crimson on West End would agree.',\n",

       "   'summary': \"FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. – Tennessee football fans were in disbelief when quarterback Nico Iamaleava inexplicably ran out of bounds after time expired to seal a 19-14 shocking loss to Arkansas.\\nAnd they all had the same thought: I can't believe it happened again.\\nIn 2021, UT quarterback Joe Milton ran out of bounds rather than attempt a pass into the end zone on the final play of a 31-26 loss to Ole Miss.\\n'(It was) a different situation,' coach Josh Heupel said after the loss to Arkansas on Saturday when asked why that specific mistake has happened twice. 'Older quarterback versus first (year) guy experience.'\\nThat's probably not the explanation that UT fans want to hear. But none would've been satisfactory after the No. 4 Vols had such a lackluster performance.\\nIt's three years too late to try to make sense of Milton's mistake.\\nBut why did Iamaleava commit the same baffling error?\\nNico Iamaleava's account of final play\\nThere were six seconds remaining when UT snapped the ball from the Arkansas 20-yard line.\\nAnd after Iamaleava scrambled, it was clear that the clock had expired. Yet he kept running to his right, never attempted a pass and then ran out of bounds to finish the game.\\nAfter the loss, the redshirt freshman tried to explain his mistake.\\n'As I rolled out, I saw (Dont'e Thornton) coming open. But if I threw that ball, it was going to be batted down right away,' Iamaleava said. 'So I tried to let Chris Brazzell work a little bit, and he was covered at the time.\\n'As soon as I was trying to let the ball go, I felt it slipping in my hand. I've got to do a better job of holding the ball.'\\nSo Iamaleava was trying to find an open receiver rather than just any receiver. And when he finally found an option that was better than nothing, he couldn't grip the ball to deliver the pass.\\nThen he ran out of real estate.\\nJosh Heupel: 'You can't keep the ball in your hands'\\nArkansas fans immediately stormed the field in celebration after the play. UT players pushed their way to the locker room.\\nA few minutes later, Heupel knew the question about the final play was coming in the postgame press conference.\\n'In that scenario you've got to get the ball up and give one of your guys an opportunity to make a play,' Heupel said. 'You can't keep the ball in your hands. You want to give somebody an opportunity to go make a play. (Iamaleava) is disappointed with it. But he's got to come back and bounce back from it.\\n'Nico, just like me and just like our football team, wishes we would've played better.'\\nIamaleava was 16-of-28 passing for 156 yards. He was under constant pressure all night, and the Vols never fully adjusted.\\nIt was also Iamaleava's first loss as a starter. He had won his first five starts in a streak that dated back to the Citrus Bowl last season.\\nNow the former five-star recruit must lead UT in a rebound game against Florida on Saturday, Oct. 12 (7 p.m. ET, ESPN) at Neyland Stadium.\\n'He's played too good not to respond the right way,' Heupel said. 'And I know he will.'\",\n",

       "   'excerpt': \"UT's passing game has basically disappeared the past two games. A conservative approach made sense against Oklahoma. But not against Arkansas.\",\n",
       "   'summary': \"History came calling on Tennessee football Saturday. Its message: 'Same old Vols.'\\nThat's probably what many UT fans were thinking as unranked Arkansas reduced the No. 4 Vols' high-flying offense to rubble in a 19-14 victory at Reynolds Razorbacks Stadium.\\nThose fans have seen it all before. Just when they thought the Vols were soaring toward great heights, UT crashed at the most unlikely time.\\nYou saw it two years ago when the Vols were still in the running for the College Football Playoff. A mediocre South Carolina team ambushed them in Columbia by an outrageous 63-38 count.\\nYou saw it again in Fayetteville, where the Razorbacks have now won four of their past five games against the Vols.\\nThose victories included a 28-24 upset of the then-third-ranked Vols, who were going for back-to-back national championships before faltering against Arkansas in November of 1999. Then, in 2011, the Razorbacks handed the Vols one of their worst defeats – 49-7 under coach Bobby Petrino.\\nOn Saturday, Petrino was calling the plays for beleaguered Arkansas coach Sam Pittman, who began the season on the proverbial hot seat. But the Arkansas defense unleashed the most devastating blows to Tennessee's championship hopes.\\nAnd Tennessee's renowned play-calling coach Josh Heupel couldn't do anything about it. Neither could star quarterback Nico Iamaleava, who strangely ran out of bounds on the last play of the game.\\nThe Vols faced a fourth-and-5 on the Arkansas 20-yard line with six seconds to play. Iamaleava rolled to his right and just kept rolling − right out of bounds. The mistake was inexcusable. A junior high school quarterback should have known his only option was to throw for the end zone.\\nHis last-second decision was indicative of Tennessee's offensive decision-making for much of the game.\\nHeupel's offense has never performed so ineptly as it did in the first half. The Vols managed just four first downs and 76 yards.\\nThe offensive line was helpless against Arkansas' defensive front in that half. It couldn't protect Iamaleava, who was sacked three times, and couldn't create running lanes for Dylan Sampson, who averaged 112.3 yards rushing in the first four games.\\nThose four games contributed to the enormity of the upset. The Vols, who were favored by 13.5 points, were never behind in the first third of the season during which they outscored the opposition by a combined score of 216-28.\\nUT offense couldn't have looked worse if it had messaged the Razorbacks its play calls before each snap, then pointed toward its intended destination.\\nThe second half didn't bring more of the same. Suddenly, Tennessee played up to its favorite's role, scoring two quick touchdowns behind improved blocking and the running of Sampson.\\nLater, you could sum up UT's surge with two words: false hope.\\nJust when Tennessee had stolen the momentum and seemingly taken control of the game, Arkansas struck back for a touchdown and field goal. Then, in the final minutes, it delivered a knockout, despite having lost starting quarterback Taylen Green and lead running back Ja'Quinden Jackson to injury.\\nNever mind the attrition. Backup quarterback Malachi Singleton and backup running back Braylen Russell spearheaded the game-winning drive.\\nWhile the outcome was stunning, the lack of offense wasn't a one-time thing. The Vols didn't pile up the yardage and points in their last outing, a 25-15 victory over Oklahoma.\\nBut I attributed that to conservative play-calling, which made sense since UT's offensive line had been hobbled by a couple of key injuries and the Sooners didn't present much of an offensive threat.\\nThe offense against Arkansas wasn't by design. It was a colossal failure against a defense that gave up three touchdown passes to UAB and more than 300 yards passing to Oklahoma State.\\nThose offensive struggles started with Heupel and ended with Iamaleava running out of bounds and into defeat.\",\n",
